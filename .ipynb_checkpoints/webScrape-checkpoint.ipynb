      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Mega-cap stocks are solid investments overall for several reasons. Recently, they’ve been responsible for the lion’s share of increases in the S&P 500. An investor who focused solely on mega-cap stocks would have outperformed the stock market overall during that period. So,  a high potential for strong returns is one of the best reasons to consider investing in mega-cap companies. The other primary benefit of investing in mega-cap stocks is that they are generally safe. Most of these companies are also blue chip stocks, meaning that they are household names. They tend to have long track records of impressive performance that suggest continued stability. On top of that, they often provide income in the form of dividends. It all suggests stability. Those are two excellent reasons to consider investing. Let’s look at seven mega-cap stocks that have the potential to double your money within three years. AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) has emerged as a key challenger in the race for artificial intelligence (AI) chip dominance. Generally speaking, that is the reason investors are so interested in the stock currently. Most investors are simply reacting to the general strong sentiment surrounding the firm to rationalize their investment. Dig a little bit deeper, and it’s easy to understand why AMD is indeed a strong investment but also one that can triple within the next few years.  The logic for believing that statement can be found in comments made by CEO Lisa Su. Late last year Sue predicted that the market for AI data center chips could reach $400 billion by 2027. Analysts from New Street research noted that even if data center spending only reaches half that target in that time frame, it would correlate to a potential quadrupling of AMD’s price, which was roughly $130 at that time. That would put its price in the low $500s, which is roughly triple its current price. The arithmetic that governs a potential doubling in ASML (NASDAQ:ASML) stock by 2027 is fairly straightforward. Let’s start by running through that quickly. Analysts currently believe that ASML shares could rise approximately 25% in the next year. That Would bring prices to $1,215 in 2025. Let’s imagine that things continue to go well and progress at the same pace for the next two years. That would bring prices just above $1,500 in 2026  and near $1,900 by 2027. That equates to a doubling from its current price. It’s also perfectly logical to believe that that is possible, given the strength of ASML’s products and their relation to current trends. It’s then one of those mega-cap stocks to consider.  ASML is the leading chip tool maker at the leading edge of the technology. the company enjoys a monopoly over extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV). That technology is used to etch patterns on the most complex chip wafers and is indispensable in relation to artificial intelligence. If the AI trend continues as it has, it’s entirely likely that ASML doubles in that timeframe. Adobe’s (NASDAQ:ADBE) stock, like that of so many other companies on this list,  is rising and falling on the potential of artificial intelligence. The emergence of artificial intelligence is the reason to believe Adobe could double from here. Now is arguably an excellent time to stake a position in the stock. Adobe is well known for Photoshop and other graphics tools that position the firm well in the generative AI race. That’s the primary reason that the stock did so well last year. However, Adobe was unable to monetize it to the level investors had expected. The result is that Shares currently trade for $485. That follows a strong pullback that began in February. I’d argue that it’s an overreaction to the overreaction that created the hype in the first place. Adobe did not end up buying Figma which many believed was a bad deal to begin with. That’s positive news. Adobe just has to figure out how to better monetize Firefly. There’s a huge opportunity, given the demand for AI products in content creation. Adobe can easily double from its current price point by 2027. This makes it one of those mega-cap stocks for investors to consider. Many investors are looking for reasons to invest in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)  stock at the moment. there’s a clear contrarian opportunity for those who can find optimism among all the negativity. Shares currently trade for $170. So, it’s easy to see why they have the potential to double in the next few years, given that they traded above $400 just before quantitative tightening set in.  Don’t be fooled, there is plenty of reason for negativity at the moment. Tesla just released its Q1 delivery figures which were disappointing. Elon Musk’s company delivered 386,810 vehicles during the first quarter representing an 8.6% decline year over year. It was the first time since the pandemic began that deliveries fell. Those delivery figures were also far below numbers analysts had been expecting. Beyond that, competition is heating up in the EV sector. Tesla won’t benefit as strongly from its early competitive advantages moving into the future. However, it isn’t all doom and gloom in the near term. Shipping disruptions in the Red Sea were partially to blame for the lower-than-expected delivery numbers. Furthermore, at some point, the Chinese economy will turn around, and demand will rebound. That should propel Tesla higher in the coming year or so. Despite its strong growth, it’s unlikely to surprise many that Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock has the potential to double from here. Let’s assume two things; one, Nvidia continues to enjoy a dominant position in relation to AI for the next few years, two, strong metrics continue to hold over that period. Under that scenario Nvidia can double by 2027.  Nvidia’s sales are expected to be somewhere in the neighborhood of $102 billion dollars in 2025, per consensus estimates. Some Wall Street analysts believe that revenues could reach $300 billion by 2027 on AI chip sales alone. Nvidia shares would easily double under that scenario and, more realistically, would triple in value, assuming valuations hold steady. Growing from $102 billion in sales in 2025 to $300 billion by 2027 makes that potential very obvious. More likely, though, metrics like the P/E ratio would rise even higher if Nvidia sales grow that quickly. Thus, share prices would more than triple if sales grow to that height by 2027. Could Toyota (NYSE:TM) stock eventually emerge as the biggest winner in the EV revolution?  The answer is a resounding: “Yes!” Toyota has been building ultra-reliable, somewhat uninspiring vehicles for many decades. The company’s nature is to default to data suggestive of reliability in guiding its decision processes. It’s highly likely that Toyota knew that a pure EV strategy was not the way forward based on such data. That got Toyota in trouble relative to other big automobile manufacturers that adopted the EV craze to their detriment. Just look at what has happened to Ford (NYSE:F) and GM (NYSE:GM). Their decision to invest heavily in pure EV technology hasn’t paid off. Toyota believes that a hybrid first strategy is The logical path toward EV profits.  As the EV hype has died down, Toyota suddenly looks brilliant. The point here is not for Toyota to say I told you so but rather that the company’s slower, iterative approach will win in the end. That’s why I believe the company will ultimately emerge as one of the big winners in the EV race over time. Toyota is likely to find profitability from EVs without sinking unnecessary billions of dollars into the technology in an effort to skip the necessary steps. It’s no secret that many investors are betting on Alibaba (NASDAQ:BABA) stock to double in the next few years. Share prices have fallen by more than 75% since late 2020. During that period, Alibaba has gone from a presumed competitor with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to something much less flattering. In any case, it’s very easy to find a narrative in which Alibaba doubles in the next few years. Let’s do some simple arithmetic that proves the possibility is entirely real. Alibaba’s price/sales ratio over the last 10 years has a median of 8.34. However, it currently stands at 1.43. It doesn’t seem likely that it’ll rise to the median anytime soon: the Chinese economy continues to experience difficulty. Alibaba’s shares are unlikely to pop for that reason. However, imagine that the P/S ratio doubles. That would correlate to a doubling of price and more, given that sales are predicted to continue growing, albeit at a slower pace. If the Chinese economy rebounds over the next few years, it’s all entirely possible. This makes it one of those mega-cap stocks to buy.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Some large retail stocks, including many major department stores that are focused on apparel, are struggling. Macy’s (NYSE:M) plans to close 150 stores by 2026. History shows store closings for brick-and-mortar-oriented retailers is often the prelude to tremendous financial struggles and, ultimately, bankruptcy. But more generalized, big-box retail stocks, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Target (NYSE:TGT), are thriving in the e-commerce era. Luring consumers to their stores with low-cost groceries and other necessities, they subsequently benefit from these shoppers’ decision to purchase more profitable items from them — such as TVs and computer accessories. Moreover, in many cases these big-box retailers have successfully launched e-commerce operations. They are also benefiting from the closure of many department store chains over the years. This should set a number of big-box retailers up for success — and should double your money by 2030. Here are three top retail stocks to buy within the category. Target’s earnings per share jumped almost 50% last year to $8.94, while its operating income surged by nearly $2 billion in 2023. Additionally, its operating margin came in at 5.8% during the holiday season, up from 3.7% during the same period a year earlier. The company has launched a service known as Target Circle 360. The service will be similar to Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) Amazon Prime and Walmart’s Walmart+. Specifically, Target Circle 360 will offer members free same-day or two-day delivery for orders over $35 — in potentially as little as one hour.  Amazon Prime and Walmart+ have successfully increased online sales for the two retail giants. I expect TGT to benefit from a similar trend in the medium and the long term. In February, Goldman Sachs added TGT stock to its Conviction List, citing the retailer’s ability to benefit from strong consumer spending trends and its low valuation. Walmart’s top line rose by an impressive 5.7% last quarter versus the same period a year earlier, while its global ecommerce sales surged 23% year-over-year. Moreover, its operating income soared 13% year-over-year. The large increase in its e-commerce sales indicates that its Walmart+ subscription delivery service is helping the firm and bodes well for the company’s longer-term outlook. Moreover, WMT has become a leader among retailers when it comes to utilizing AI. The firm’s extensive AI initiatives should help cut costs, streamline customer acquisitions and  better serve its existing customers.  Citi recently included WMT in its list of “recommended large-cap stocks.” The shares have a very low enterprise value/Revenue ratio of 0.82 times. TJX Companies’ (NYSE:TJX) stores may not be traditionally viewed as big-box retailers. But its Marshalls stores are fairly large. Moreover, in my experience the firm often places TJ Maxx stores right next to Home Goods stores. This creates a shopping experience somewhat akin to what Target and Walmart provide. What’s more, like Target and Walmart, TJX’s stores offer low-cost products that entice huge numbers of consumers.. Meanwhile, in a note to investors, investment bank Jefferies predicted that TJX could benefit from Macy’s store closures.  Further, TJX showed confidence in its own outlook by recently raising its dividend by 13% and pledging to carry out $2 billion to $2.5 billion of share buybacks in fiscal 2025.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Many investors dream of getting in early on the next big tech startup that will turn into a behemoth like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) or Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Finding and investing in the next unicorn company while it is still in its infancy would lead to almost unfathomable returns. However, picking winners is easier said than done. For every Google or Facebook, thousands of failed startups and penny stocks never amount to much. It’s like trying to find the proverbial needle in a haystack. While it may be next to impossible to predict which fledgling tech companies will become the next Google, that doesn’t mean you can’t generate substantial returns from investing in tech penny stocks. The key is being selective and sticking with quality companies that have a big growth runway and a viable path to profitability. Many of today’s tech giants were once small, speculative tech stocks. Buying these penny tech stocks in their early days can pay off in a big way over the long run. CI&T (NYSE:CINT) is an AI-powered digital products company that I believe could deliver multibagger returns from its current cheap valuation. In addition to AI, the company is involved in other hot growth sectors like cloud services. The stock has been consolidating sideways for the past couple of months but appears to be bottoming out. I expect shares to start cruising higher again soon on the back of robust growth and expanding margins. The consensus earnings estimates for CI&T paint quite a bullish growth picture. EPS is projected to skyrocket from 28 cents in fiscal 2024 to $1.10 in 2027. Not too shabby! On the top line, revenues are forecast to more than double from $448 million to $932 million over that same period.  You’re paying just 4.1 times 2027 earnings. Once sentiment shifts back in favor of growth, this stock could be off to the races. WidePoint (NYSEMKT:WYY) is a tiny technology management service provider catering to government and business clients across North America and Europe. The company’s Trusted Mobility Management (TM2) solutions combine telecom lifecycle management, bill analytics, and mobile identity management. In a nutshell, they help secure and protect mobile workforces and enterprise IT environments. WidePoint is highly speculative given its minuscule $19 million market cap. Shares doubled from November 2023 through January 2024 but have slid since then. However, the valuation still looks cheap to me, so I wouldn’t be surprised to see the stock quickly reverse course and head higher again. The main thing WidePoint has going for it is a customer base that includes the U.S. government. From my experience, once you’re in with the feds, that recurring revenue tends to be very sticky. However, with such a small company, be prepared for some violent stock swings in both directions. This is not a stock for the faint of heart, but more speculative investors may find the risk/reward intriguing. CuriosityStream (NASDAQ:CURI) is a subscription video streaming service specializing in documentaries and other factual content like science, history, and nature programming. I view it as a differentiated player in the crowded streaming wars. As digital media consumption continues rising, I believe CuriosityStream is well-positioned to benefit from its unique content catalog sourced from some top documentary creators.  Many of these content creators have huge followings on platforms like YouTube but also produce exclusive material for CuriosityStream. As the company’s content library expands, I expect its brand equity and subscriber base to grow in tandem. CuriosityStream is still unprofitable, but that may change in the not-so-distant future. Consensus estimates show CuriosityStream’s net losses narrowing over the next few years before reaching breakeven in 2026 with EPS of 5 cents. At the same time, revenue growth is expected to accelerate to nearly 15% that year. Rising revenues combined with drastically improving margins suggest profitability is on the horizon. If CuriosityStream can scale its subscriber base and content portfolio while keeping costs contained, it could be one of the top gainers among penny tech stocks. Rimini Street (NASDAQ:RMNI) provides third-party support for mission-critical enterprise software platforms like Oracle and SAP. They help organizations run, manage, and maintain these systems even after official vendor support ends. Rimini’s services save clients money and ensure smooth operations of their IT infrastructure. RMNI’s chart looks quite ugly when you zoom out over just the past year. Recent performance hasn’t been stellar either. However, I believe shares can stage a significant recovery from current levels as the company’s financials improve. Moreover, the stock trades at a dirt cheap 6 times forward earnings. You’d be hard-pressed to find many other profitable companies with a big growth runway trading this cheaply. The earnings estimates for Rimini Street suggest a period of steady growth and profitability improvement ahead. EPS is forecasted to increase from 45 cents in 2024 to 58 cents in 2025, up 30% year-over-year (YOY). Revenues are also projected to reach $471 million in 2025 from $436 million in 2024.  Another thing I like about Rimini is the stock has seen negligible dilution thanks to profits picking up after a temporary downturn in 2022. Management isn’t relying on endless share issuances to fund the business. This should provide a nice tailwind in the years ahead. Xunlei Limited (NASDAQ:XNET) operates an internet platform in China, leveraging cloud technology. The company focuses on shared cloud computing and blockchain technology to provide solutions for digital content. XNET stock has been trading sideways for the past two years. But I believe a breakout could happen soon as the company’s financials continue growing significantly and it focuses more on higher-margin cloud-based services. One thing that really stands out to me is Xunlei’s massive cash position of $272 million. That’s nearly triple the company’s entire market cap of just $98 million! Xunlei also heavily invests in R&D, which could pay off big time if it can become a tech powerhouse in the future. Regardless of the R&D potential though, I find XNET shares to be extremely undervalued right now. This is a profitable tech company with a huge runway for growth, yet it trades at a measly 7 times trailing earnings. In my view, the stock is a coiled spring ready to deliver multibagger returns going forward. TrueCar (NASDAQ:TRUE) is a digital automotive marketplace aiming to be the most transparent brand in the industry. It empowers car buyers by showing them what others paid for the vehicle they want, helping them recognize a fair price. TrueCar connects these consumers to certified dealers, facilitating a personalized and efficient car buying experience.  Like other automotive stocks, TrueCar hasn’t fared too well recently as rising interest rates caused people to cut back on big-ticket purchases like cars. However, this trend is starting to change as rates stabilize and consumers adjust to the new normal. TRUE stock has been rangebound between $3 to $5 for most of the past five years. But I believe it could soon break out to the upside as the company’s top and bottom lines begin turning around. The earnings estimates for TrueCar indicate a gradual return to profitability over the next several years. While a small loss of 4 cents per share is projected for 2024, earnings are expected to flip to positive in 2025 and grow steadily from there, reaching 35 cents per share in 2029. Revenue growth is also forecasted to be robust, with double-digit increases each year, hitting $317 million by 2029 from $183 million in 2024. The improving fundamentals make it unlikely TRUE shares remain stuck in their current range as the core business rapidly grows. The stars are aligning for this automotive marketplace to shift into a higher gear. Blend Labs (NYSE:BLND) provides a cloud-based software platform for financial services firms in the U.S. It operates two main segments: Blend Platform and Title365. The Blend Builder Platform offers products powering digital-first consumer journeys for mortgages, home equity loans, vehicle loans, and more. The company also provides title search procedures and other professional services. BLND stock has struggled mightily the past few years, down a staggering 85% over the past five. But shares have shown signs of life recently, skyrocketing 254% in the past year alone as Blend’s consumer banking segment picks up steam. I expect the strong performance to continue long-term as well.  As I touched on earlier, elevated interest rates caused many folks to delay borrowing money for major purchases. This weighed on Blend’s business since it meant fewer customers taking out loans. However, the Fed is widely expected to cut rates three times this year. Once that process begins, borrowing activity should pick up considerably, boosting Blend’s top and bottom lines. The company is forecast to turn profitable in 2026, with revenue growth accelerating to around 30% annually. Perhaps more exciting, significant margin expansion could be in the cards as Blend’s automation and AI initiatives start bearing fruit. If management can execute, I wouldn’t be surprised to see the stock deliver triple-digit returns in the coming years.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Electric Vehicle (EV) maker Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) stock is being hailed as “the new Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).” The idea is it has cool cars, it has a clear path toward scaling and profits, and it doesn’t have a crazy CEO. Instead, it has R.J. Scaringe, a 41-year old Florida native and the son of an engineer. But as a stock, the new Tesla is not much different from the old one. Shares are down 57% this year, the market cap below $10 billion. The problem isn’t supply, but demand. I got to see a Rivian R1T truck in Atlanta recently. It’s impressive and, unlike the Tesla Cybertruck, it looks familiar. That is, until you look inside. Then it becomes very simple indeed. Open the hood and you don’t see an engine, just a front-end trunk.  All EVs are simple machines. A low-level platform holds the batteries that power it, the motor is just a rotor spinning inside an electromagnet.. The transmission is simple, supporting just 1-2 gears. All the moving parts of the EV rest at the platform level, so the top can be anything you want. (The platform is usually called a skateboard.) The R1T looks like a truck because people are accustomed to trucks. Change the body and it’s a Sports Utility Vehicle (SUV), the R1S. Change it again and it’s a delivery van, which may be more important. Rivian’s main task now is downsizing the platform. A smaller R2 platform will lead to cars costing just $45,000. Rivian believes the even-smaller R3 platform will deliver cars at $35,000. This is what most excited people at its recent press conference. The passenger car version of the R3 is a “crossover,” like my Toyota (NYSE:TM) Scion XB of blessed memory. Reviewers are excited. Rivian’s challenge is getting from the R1 to the R3.  Despite a lot of hype, RIVN stock made fewer than 14,000 vehicles in the last quarter. The production target for 2024 is just 57,000. It’s a tiny fraction of the 387,000 Tesla made, a result that tanked the stock and overwhelmed demand. Rivian lost $5.4 billion last year, ending the year with $7.8 billion in cash. It lost $4.86 billion of cash on operations, raising $3.13 billion, mainly convertible notes. You can see why RIVN stock put off development of its Georgia plant, preferring to continue operations in Normal, Illinois, where it has 8,000 employees. It doesn’t have the money. Key to getting the cash will be re-tooling the Normal plant for the R2 this summer. The hope is this will result in a gross profit on the cars by the fourth quarter. Half the savings would come from unspecified “design changes, supplier negotiations, and lower raw material costs.”  A gross profit should raise the stock price, and make stock easier to sell. Tesla now sells at 5 times sales, Rivian at 2 times, because Tesla makes money at scale and Rivian does not. It’s going to be tight. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has only gotten 10,000 of the 100,000 delivery vans it ordered five years ago. That, and stock purchases from Amazon and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) (Ford has since sold out), put Rivian on the map. Exclusivity on the vans ended late last year, prompting a big order from AT&T (NYSE:T). To get to 2025, Rivian must make money on the vans. The van’s design illustrates the hope I still have in the EV market. It’s built on the same skateboard platform as the R1T. As battery costs decline, this simple design will overpower complex ICE machines and change the world.  Whether Rivian will be part of that world will be answered in 2024. If it is, you’re speculating near the lows. If the numbers let it commit to Georgia, then you buy with both hands. As of this writing, Dana Blankenhorn had a LONG position in AMZN.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Blue-chip stocks offer more stability than most stocks. Corporations in this category are profitable, and some of them are still growing at good rates. While the year started off strong, March was a bit slower. The S&P 500 only gained 3% during the month while it gained 5% in February. An April upswing can move blue-chip stocks higher. It’s nice to see stocks move higher in one month, but investors should prioritize what a stock will look like after a few years. These blue-chip stocks exhibit promising signs that indicate they have more room for long-term gains. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has a steady record of outperforming the stock market and delivering gains for shareholders. The stock is up by 252% over the past five years and offers a 0.71% dividend yield.  The company’s dominance in cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and other industries has prompted many analysts to feel bullish about the stock’s long-term prospects. The average price target suggests an 11% upside. Microsoft is also rated as a “Strong Buy” among 35 analysts. The highest price target of $550 per share implies a 29% gain from current levels. Microsoft Azure continues to gain market share in the cloud computing industry. This major catalyst grew by 24% year-over-year in Q2 FY24 and contributed to more than half of Microsoft’s total revenue. Cloud computing has also helped Microsoft expand its profit margins. That has led to a lower P/E ratio and high dividend hikes each year. The rising demand of artificial intelligence should increase Microsoft Cloud’s runway. American Express (NYSE:AXP) is an enticing dividend growth stock thanks to its valuation, consistent financial growth, and high-profit margins. The stock has a 20 P/E ratio and a 1.26% dividend yield. American Express recently announced a 17% dividend hike amid good financial results in the fourth quarter of 2023. During that quarter, revenue increased by 11% year-over-year while net income jumped by 23% year-over-year. American Express also announced that it intends on generating 9% to 11% year-over-year revenue growth beyond 2026. The company also expects EPS growth rates to range in the mid-teens during the same time. These announcements are a part of the company’s growth plan which started in January 2022. American Express generated record revenue and profits in 2023 by adding 12.2 million new cards over the past year. The number of “cards-in-force” issued exceeds 140 million. People will use their credit and debit cards during any economic cycle. American Express offers more insulation than many corporations when the economy slows down.  Deckers Outdoor (NYSE:DECK) is an emerging athletic apparel brand that is stealing market share from top competitors. The company’s Hoka and Ugg brands have been a big hit with consumers. Revenue increased by 16% year-over-year in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 to reach a record $1.56 billion. The company’s fiscal 2024 revenue guidance suggests it will generate 14% more sales in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023. The company’s profits grew by 40% year-over-year and helped Deckers Outdoor secure a 25% net profit margin. Ugg has been doing most of the work and reached $1.072 billion in revenue during the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Hola came in second with $429.3 million in revenue but is growing at a faster rate. Ugg brand net sales increased by 15.2% year-over-year while Hoka brand net sales grew by 21.9% year-over-year. Deckers Outdoor has received more attention ever since it was added to the S&P 500. Even before its inclusion, the stock has comfortably outperformed the market by delivering a 480% gain over the past five years. Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) sells essential home care and grooming products that won’t go out of style during an economic bust. The stock has only delivered a 49% gain over the past five years which is below the S&P 500’s gains during the same time period. However, this blue-chip stock doesn’t experience as much volatility. PG stock only has a 0.43 beta compared to the S&P 500’s 1.00 beta. Beta is a measure of an investment’s volatility. While many growth investors want to forget 2022, Procter & Gamble only lost 7% of its value during that year. The company’s 2.41% dividend yield helped to offset some of those losses.  Speaking of the dividend, it’s one of the most reliable payouts in the market. Procter & Gamble has distributed dividends for 133 consecutive years. The includes 67 consecutive years of dividend hikes. Procter & Gamble has the flexibility to raise prices during inflation and reward long-term investors. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a dominant force in the e-commerce industry. Amazon’s vast logistics network makes it easy for most people to receive any product within 1-2 days. The tech giant also has same-day shipping available at some locations. The company has a deep moat for its online marketplace, and that competitive advantage resulted in record revenue in Q4 2023. Amazon increased its net sales by 14% year-over-year to reach $170.0 billion. Amazon grew its international revenue by 17% year-over-year while revenue from North America was up by 13% year-over-year. Amazon also has a competitive moat with its cloud computing platform. Amazon Web Services exhibited a 13% year-over-year growth rate to reach $24.2 billion. The company is also expanding into advertising, video streaming, and artificial intelligence. These growth opportunities can result in higher revenue growth and rising profit margins. This makes it one of those blue-chip stocks to buy. Amazon stock is up by 23% year-to-date and has plenty of fans on Wall Street. The average price target suggests a 13% upside. The stock is rated as a “Strong Buy” among 41 analysts.  Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is another blue-chip stock to consider after the social media giant has rented its focus on rising profit margins. Analysts have cheered on the company’s recent results and currently view the company as a “Strong Buy.” The highest price target of $609 per share suggests a 16% upside from the current price. The stock has been getting more attention due to its recent dividend. Meta Platforms announced its first dividend in the fourth quarter of 2023. The company also reported 25% year-over-year revenue growth and 201% year-over-year net income growth in that quarter. The dividend was the icing on the cake. Many advertisers flock to Meta Platforms to reach more of their potential customers. The company has a comfortable lead over other social networks. A TikTok ban would push Meta Platforms higher up on its pedestal. Meta Platforms doesn’t need a controversial TikTok ban to gain market share, but it is a catalysts that investors should monitor. Visa (NYSE:V) offers stability since many people will use credit and debit cards during various economic cycles. These plastic cards are more convenient than carrying around spare change and can also help with credit building (credit cards only) and have enticing rewards programs. You aren’t earning 2% cashback if you use paper cash for your purchases, and credit cards let you access money that you currently don’t have. These financial products can put you into a lot of debt, but they are useful for many people.  Visa has been using this formula to deliver impressive returns for shareholders. The stock has gained 7% year-to-date and is up by 74% over the past five years. Visa also has a 0.75% dividend yield and has a compounded annual growth rate of 18.18% over the past five years. The stock only has a 21.50% dividend payout ratio, which suggests it has plenty of room to increase its distributions. The fintech company also boasts solid financials. Visa reported 9% year-over-year revenue growth and 17% year-over-year GAAP net income growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. It’s one of those blue-chip stocks to consider.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips The artificial intelligence (AI) industry has captivated investors. Corporations have been rushing to incorporate the technology into their operations to increase efficiency and revenue. AI was the big buzzword of 2023, and that momentum has carried over into 2024. Many of the top AI stocks have continued to rack up gains. The sector is attracting a lot of speculation, which can risk the loss of capital. However, some AI stocks are the real deal and look ready to deliver long-term returns for their shareholders. It’s not too late to invest in the best AI stocks to buy. These are some of the stocks that you may want to monitor. CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a cybersecurity firm that continues to grow while most competitors are losing ground. The company has an excellent recurring revenue model that grew by 34% year-over-year (YoY) in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. Annual recurring revenue currently stands at $3.44 billion.  Cybersecurity is a lucrative industry since businesses need safeguards to protect their data and sensitive documents from hackers. Cybercriminals are getting smarter and some are turning to AI to initiate more cyber attacks. Cybersecurity firms are fortifying their defenses with AI tool offerings. CrowdStrike recently launched Charlotte AI, which allows cybersecurity teams to streamline their work and detect threats more quickly. A customer survey revealed the average person saves two hours per day with the company’s generative AI solution. Charlotte AI was built by defenders for defenders, and it’s one of the driving forces for CrowdStrike’s gains. The stock is up by 397% over the past 5 years. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has been incorporating AI into many of its products and services. The company uses AI to offer relevant product recommendations for people who browse its online marketplace. Amazon Web Services also utilizes AI to offer customers more choices. AWS allows customers to build better AI applications that can generate more leads and save time. AI requires more computing power. While advanced chips power the hardware, cloud computing is the software component. The cloud computing industry has been growing as more companies adopt AI. Cloud platforms have the flexibility to handle and store additional data. Amazon is still a juggernaut that reports strong financials. Profit margins recently expanded as the company reached a record $170.0 billion in sales in Q4 2023. Revenue increased by 14%, and most of Amazon’s important segments exhibited double-digit revenue growth rates. North American sales increased 13% YoY, while international sales jumped by 17% YoY. Amazon Web Services revenue was 13% higher than the same period last year.  Synopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS) is a chipmaker riding the AI tailwinds. The stock isn’t reliant on AI and reported solid financials long before the technology became mainstream. Synopsys stock is up by 395% over the past 5 years and has posted a 13% year-to-date gain. The stock has a 63 P/E ratio and impressive profit margin expansion that suggests more upside. The company achieved a 27% net profit margin as revenue and earnings both soared in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Revenue increased by 21% YoY while net income jumped by 65% YoY. Synopsys also exceeded the high end of guidance for its quarterly GAAP EPS. Synopsys is in the process of acquiring Ansys (NASDAQ:ANSS), which would lead to additional market share. The semiconductor firm is delivering healthy financial growth while having a meaningful runway. AI tailwinds can elevate the stock price and reward long-term investors.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Today’s solar eclipse will be much more captivating than any sort of market-related news. However, there has been some eclipse-related news that has investors examining the economic impacts of this rare event. From surging business in the wake of the total eclipse across North America to eclipse glasses recalls, there’s plenty to focus on from a business angle. The recall of various solar eclipse glasses is certainly an important news announcement worth paying attention to. With millions of onlookers ready to strap on their glasses to watch this total eclipse, knowing whether the glasses you’ll be donning are safe is of utmost importance. Here’s what to know about the announced recalls and what consumers need to check. The most notable recalls affect certain solar eclipse glasses that were bought on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). The e-commerce giant reportedly issued a recall warning, claiming these glasses are not safe to be used to view the eclipse directly, despite packaging that shows said glasses are “AAS Approved.”  The particular item in question is the “Biniki Solar Eclipse Glasses AAS Approved 2024 – CE & ISO Certified Safe Shades for Direct Sun Viewing (6 Packs).” Another set of solar eclipse glasses, with the EN ISO number 12312-1: 2022, were reportedly recalled in certain Midwestern states. It’s important for onlookers to remember that sunglasses are not a safe alternative for watching this eclipse, and only glasses that block ultraviolet and infrared light should be used to view this eclipse. Notably, it is difficult to discern between counterfeit glasses and those that are approved by the American Astronomical Society (AAS). But looking for an “AAS-approved” symbol is a great place for eclipse-goers to look. Ensuring that a given seller is identified on the AAS website and listed on that page is also important.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips China is home to one of the biggest economies in the world, and after lifting its long, strict COVID regulations, it is on the rebound. Despite slow growth in the second half of last year, which caused many stocks to take a hit, some stocks have still persevered and produced excellent results. These three Chinese stocks have managed to overcome the economic difficulties affecting industries and continue to hold some of the best buy ratings for this year. Investors should consider these stocks for their potential with growing market shares and dominant selling performances in their respective sectors. Let’s learn about these stocks’ resilience, growth prospects and reassuring financials, which have earned them Strong Buy ratings and should put them at the top of investors’ lists this month. PDD Holdings (NASDAQ:PDD) owns and operates some of the largest e-commerce platforms in China and the world. Its most popular platform is Temu, which has the second-most monthly users behind Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).  PDD took a slight hit earlier this year, but after a Q4 earnings beat, the stock saw a considerable boost. Investors were excited by the company’s Q4 revenue of $12.52 billion and adjusted EPS of $2.40. This stock’s Strong Buy ratings also come from the optimistic consensus estimates. The company is predicted to see a 35% increase in earnings growth this year and a significant jump in revenue on top of its rebound. PDD has a dominant hold over the e-commerce market in China and continues to show impressive growth. Investors should buy now and watch as this stock takes off this year. Alibaba Group (NYSE:BABA) is another e-commerce giant based in China. Like many competitors, Alibaba has seen its fair share of trouble alongside the struggling Chinese economy. However, estimates remain confident that this stock will be among the first to return to the top with a hopeful 2024. These estimates are fueled by Alibaba’s extensive market share and continued performance despite the hurdles standing in its way. The most recent quarterly earnings report boasts $36.669 billion in revenue, showing a 5% growth from the previous year.  While it’s not the best growth, considering the economic pressure, Alibaba has showcased some of the best perseverance out of Chinese stocks. In addition, to reignite its stock price, Alibaba shared its massive share buyback initiative involving repurchasing 524 million ordinary shares during the quarter ended March 31, 2024. With its low price, now is a great time to buy Alibaba, believing in its proven ability to make an exciting return this year. One of the significant Chinese competitors to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI) reported a fantastic 2023 despite economic slowdowns and high spending. In Q4, Li Auto reported a 133.8% increase in sales from Q4 2022. The show didn’t stop there. Not only did Li Auto see an 182.2% increase in deliveries, but it also reported a free cash flow of $6.22 billion in 2023, a 1,861.8 % year-over-year increase. That’s enormous growth despite much higher operating expenses following its first fully electric EV release. That cash flow, in line with Li Auto’s current price, makes it a criminally underrated stock, with a price-to-free cash flow ratio of around 6.5. Though the company does not expect as massive of growth this year as 2023, many other EV makers report the same.  All things considered, Li Auto is too good of a deal and has prospects too promising for investors to pass up.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips George Soros’ hedge fund is making big bets on stocks, though not nearly as big as those he made on global currencies. His biggest investment had been Splunk, a big data analytics firm. He owned 1.6 million shares worth $240 million, representing over 4.5% of the hedge fund’s total portfolio. However, Cisco just acquired the company last month (NASDAQ:CSCO). With an average buy price of around $141 per share, Soros has made a decent profit on the $157 per share acquisition price. What follows are the next three biggest George Soros stocks held in Soros Fund Management according to the latest 13F filing with the SEC. Soros is also gambling on small-cap stocks, which is making a strong comeback. He owns 1.2 million shares of the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSEARCA:IWM), the index that charts the 2,000 smallest stocks in the Russell 3000 index. There’s good reason to believe Soros is on the right track. Historically speaking, small-cap stocks handily outperform mid and large-cap stocks. In their book Investing in Small Cap Stocks, authors Christopher Graja and Elizabeth Ungar found that over the 75 years studied, small-cap stocks beat mid-cap and large-cap stocks 60% of the time. Small-caps have underperformed their larger brethren, but beginning last October, that began to change, and today, the Russell 2000 is edging higher than the S&P 500.  While the small-cap index does hold many tiny companies with market valuations in just the tens of millions of dollars, it also holds some large ones that stretch the definition of “small-cap.” The largest stock in the index is Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI), with a market cap of $55.5 billion. Microstrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) is the next biggest with a $24 billion valuation. As those two stocks have been amongst the market’s top performers over the past year, it’s unsurprising to see the iShares Russell 2000 ETF also doing well. With an $18 billion market valuation, AerCap Holdings (NYSE:AER) isn’t quite a small-cap stock either. But it is having a solid run higher. Shares are up 18% year to date and 57% higher over the last 12 months. The Irish aircraft leasing company capped a strong year with fourth-quarter revenue of $1.9 billion. However, that was just slightly under Wall Street’s forecast for $1.92 billion. Earnings, though, easily trounced projections, coming in at $3.11 per share versus a $2.45 per share consensus view. Soros Fund Management owns almost 2.5 million shares at an average buy-in price of just under $63 per share. That values his stake at $183.5 million, which is good for a 3.5% position in his hedge fund, with the stock trading at around $88 per share, which gives Soros a 40% gain on his holdings so far. Wall Street’s price target aligns with that valuation, but analysts see AerCap rising to $101 per share on the high side. The aircraft leasing company could go higher. CEO Aengus Kelly said, “Given the strong tailwinds that we see for demand for aircraft, engines and helicopters, we are confident about the outlook for AerCap in 2024 and beyond.”  The third stock Soros is making a large bet on is Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL), which holds a 3.2% position in Soros Fund Management. He owns 1.2 million shares worth $170.3 million. The tech giant is not one of his best performers, though. The tech giant’s shares are down 13% from his average buy price of $97. Alphabet has some mixed reviews from hedge fund operators. I noted two weeks ago that Jim Simons at Renaissance Technologies was buying the stock. Still, Paul Tudor Jones from Tudor Investments and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation sold off their respective stakes. It’s hard to bet against Alphabet, though. Google remains a monopoly in search of all but names only, with a 91% market share. Although Alphabet’s advertising revenue disappointed Wall Street earlier this year, it is also an election year. Hundreds of millions of dollars will be dumped into ad campaigns. Google will grab a large portion of those ad dollars. Also, Google Cloud is a fast-growing rival to Amazon‘s (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS and Microsoft‘s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure. It has outpaced both of them for several quarters, with other irons in the fire, including Waymo self-driving vehicles. Alphabet should not be counted out by any means.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Semiconductor and AI behemoth Nvidia stock (NASDAQ:NVDA) isn’t even close to being done innovating with its core product and services portfolio. The maker of high-performance chips and AI-related software is seeing record demand, bolstering its top- and bottom-line growth metrics, and delivering whopping returns for investors. The stock more than tripled last year, and is already up roughly 80% this year. That’s the kind of growth compounding most investors would like to see over the course of decades in a given position. Indeed, Nvidia has provided that kind of growth – the kind where one decade’s worth of innovation and growth can happen in a given year. The artificial intelligence boom is for real, and Nvidia stock remains the way to play this trend. Here’s why I think this company could be worth paying up for, particularly on dips moving forward. Nvidia recently introduced the Blackwell platform at its GTC conference, revolutionizing computing with real-time generative AI at a fraction of the cost and energy usage. Featuring six cutting-edge technologies, Blackwell unlocks advancements in various industries, from data processing to quantum computing. CEO Jensen Huang sees Blackwell as pivotal for AI’s widespread adoption, with major companies like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) expected to embrace it.  Blackwell introduces six groundbreaking technologies, facilitating AI training and real-time inference for models with up to 10 trillion parameters. It boasts the world’s most powerful chip, with 208 billion transistors and a custom-built 4NP TSMC process, connecting GPU dies via 10 TB/second chip-to-chip links. The Second-Generation Transformer Engine doubles compute and model sizes, supporting 4-bit floating point AI inference. Additionally, the company’s Fifth-Generation NVLink offers 1.8TB/s bidirectional throughput per GPU for seamless communication among up to 576 GPUs. Blackwell’s RAS Engine ensures reliability, availability, and serviceability, while Secure AI safeguards models and data with advanced confidential computing capabilities. Lastly, a dedicated decompression engine accelerates data analytics and science, enhancing performance in GPU-accelerated data processing. Before the conference, Truist analyst William Stein boosted Nvidia’s price target from $911 to $1,177, anticipating heightened chip demand in 2024 and 2025. Additionally, HSBC analysts upped their price target from $880 to $1,050, maintaining a buy rating. Bank of America analysts revised their price target to $1,100 from $925. Post-conference, UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri upgraded Nvidia’s target price to $1,100 from $800, affirming a buy rating. Arcuri suggested that with Blackwell’s launch, Nvidia could tap into new global enterprise and sovereign demand.  Nvidia’s data center revenue reached $47.5 billion in 2024, with expectations to even reach a bigger number in the years to come. Analysts also anticipate to see the company hit a $300 billion revenue three years from now. With the upcoming B200 Blackwell chip promising enhanced capabilities at competitive pricing, Wall Street firms have raised Nvidia’s price targets accordingly. Nvidia stock unveiled plans for new AI GPUs based on its cutting-edge Blackwell architecture in 2024. These chips promise substantial performance boosts with lower power consumption. Nvidia anticipates widespread adoption by cloud computing providers and aims to expand its presence in the $250 billion GPU market. If Nvidia achieves a discounted 50-times earnings multiple, and reaches $25 per share in earnings, its stock price could surge to $1,250, marking a 33% jump from present levels. This projection surpasses the Street’s highest price target. Moreover, Nvidia might see even more significant gains if the market values it with a higher earnings multiple due to its exceptional growth.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Growth stocks rocketed in the first quarter as markets priced in Federal Reserve rate cuts. Indeed, based on history, the best growth stocks to buy in April will benefit if the Fed cuts rates. According to Schroders, stocks have had an average return of 11% since 1928, twelve months after the Fed began rate cuts. And, if we are just in the early innings of a bull market, growth stocks could have several years of appreciation. Further, the bull case is even stronger based on economic data. First, the unemployment rate is at 3.8%. Secondly, real wage growth has been positive over recent months, which will buoy consumer spending. Thirdly, leading economic indicators have bottomed out and U.S. manufacturing is rebounding. So, this economic and monetary policy backdrop bodes well for these best growth stocks to buy in April. According to Finviz, the following stocks will grow earnings by 30% annually for the next five years. Therefore, expect these stocks to rally further as they outperform expectations going forward.  Shake Shack (NYSE:SHAK) has been rallying on good news. First, in February, it reported impressive fourth quarter results that beat expectations. Total revenue was $286.2 million, growing 20% year over year (YOY). Shake Shack sales were up 2.8%, and it opened 41 new restaurants. Another reason for the rally was the recent appointment of Rob Lynch as CEO. He has led Papa John’s International (NASDAQ:PZZA) since 2019 and brings in a wealth of experience. His marketing and operational expertise will be valuable in the next phase of Shake Shack’s expansion. Also, the restaurant has made significant improvements in profitability. In 2023, restaurant-level operating margins improved by 240 basis points to 19.9%. Management expects more improvements through order customization, tradeups, enhanced labor deployments and supply chain optimization. Furthermore, management expects more growth in 2024 through more Shake Shack openings. They estimate 40 licensed openings and 40 domestic company-operated openings. Given these growth catalysts, analysts are bullish. TD Cowen sees upside to $125 driven by margin improvements, minimal leverage and a new CEO. Thus, Shake Shack has a long-term growth runway as it opens more restaurants. With increasing scale, profit margins will expand going forward.  Fintechs are disrupting traditional finance and winning in the process. DLocal (NASDAQ:DLO) is an upcoming player that is seeing tremendous success. It supports merchants globally in making and receiving payments efficiently and safely. Given its growth trajectory, DLocal is one of the best growth stocks to buy in April. Over the past five years, it has grown total payment volume (TPV) 14-fold to over $17.7 billion. Today, major companies like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) are customers. In 2023, its platform served over 600 merchants in 40 countries. TPV was up 67% YOY and revenue was $650 million, representing 55% growth. It is worth noting that most of the growth was from existing merchants as DLocal gained wallet share. Indeed, customers trust the company as exhibited by net revenue retention of 150%. Also, management has focused on profitable growth, achieving some of the best metrics among peers. 2023 gross profit grew 37% YOY to $277 million and adjusted EBITDA was $202 million, up 32% YOY. Looking ahead, DLocal’s prospects are very exciting. Management expects a record total payment volume in 2024, with 40% to 50% growth. They also forecast adjusted EBITDA between US$220 and US$260M, maintaining the focus on profitable growth. DLO stock is a profitable growth story that will roar higher.  Nextracker (NASDAQ:NXT) is a unique way to invest in solar growth without much risk. Unlike solar panels that are heavily commoditized, Nextracker provides proprietary software and controls for large-scale solar projects. Its solar tracker solutions align solar panels with sunlight, enhancing power production. On that note, Nextracker is in the midst of a long-term secular growth trend. As utilities retire legacy power generation assets such as coal, renewable sources like solar will fill that gap. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, U.S. solar power generation will grow from 163 billion kilowatt hours (kWh) in 2023 to 286 billion kWh next year, representing 75% growth. Thus, customer demand will grow, benefiting Nextracker. According to Mordor Intelligence, the tracker market will expand at a 22.38% compounded annual growth rate between 2024 and 2029. Nextracker is the global leader with over 500 patents and its products have been shipped to over 30 countries. Due to robust demand, revenue growth accelerated in every quarter last year. In Q2 FY2024 and Q3 FY2024, it was 23% and 38%, respectively. What’s more, it closed Q3 with a record backlog above $3 billion. For FY2024, management expects adjusted diluted EPS between $2.55 and $2.75. NXT stock is among the best growth stocks to buy in April at 20 times FY2024 EPS.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Editor’s Note: This. article was previously published under the name “Investing in the Next Wave of Explosive AI Growth” in February 2024. It has since been updated to reflect the most recent data. So far this year, the world’s leading AI chipmaker – Nvidia (NVDA) – has made it abundantly clear that the AI Boom is here. And the party’s just getting started. The tech firm reported in February that its revenues rose more than 260% in the last quarter of 2023. And management also said that revenues will rise another 230% this quarter, too. That’s got the mainstream media and most investors obsessing over Nvidia’s hyperbolic growth.  Then, in March, the company kicked off its GPU Technology Conference (GTC) with a keynote speech from CEO Jensen Huang. Huang headlined his keynote speech with the launch of Blackwell — Nvidia’s next-gen chip architecture that will enable the creation of faster, smaller, and better AI chips. Meanwhile, the most important players in this industry – including Nvidia itself – have already moved on to the next big thing: something we’re calling AI 2.0. We’ve been following these developments for a while now. We’re confident it will be the next wave of major AI growth. And it seems it’s just now hitting its major inflection point. In fact, we just learned that Nvidia itself is betting big on this next iteration. And it isn’t alone.  Microsoft (MSFT) – the world’s largest AI company – is betting big on AI 2.0, too. So are OpenAI, the world’s most influential AI startup, Amazon (AMZN), Tesla (TSLA) and Samsung. Not to mention the world’s richest men, Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos. Right now, all are pouring millions of dollars into AI 2.0. That means it’s time for you to join in and bet alongside them. So, what exactly is AI 2.0?  The real-world application of AI technologies via humanoid robots. Yes, I’m talking about AI-powered robots like the ones you’ve seen in science-fiction movies like “iRobot.” This application may seem like a pie-in-the-sky dream. But humanoid robots are already in development. This new AI wave is here. Don’t believe me? Well, Nvidia also recently announced the introduction of the Project GROOT Foundation AI model, designed to enhance the performance of humanoid robots, alongside a new system-on-a-chip named Thor for robotic use. This move comes as notable companies such as OpenAI, Microsoft (MSFT), Tesla (TSLA) (more on that in a moment), Amazon (AMZN), and Intel (INTC) heavily invest in humanoid robot development. With Nvidia joining the fray, the advent of sophisticated robots appears imminent. And we’re head over heels for this compelling investment opportunity in AI robotics.  In fact, as I write, Tesla is busy developing a humanoid robot called Optimus. And already, it can do things like fold clothes, make eggs, exercise, and dance. Tesla sees a world in the not-too-distant future where these robots are everywhere, helping people all across the globe complete menial tasks like cooking, cleaning, organizing, and more. Elon Musk is even on record saying that in time, Optimus could be bigger than Tesla’s core vehicle business. And we don’t think he’s delusional. If he is, then it seems Jeff Bezos must be, too. The former Amazon founder and CEO is reportedly pouring $100 million into a humanoid robot startup called FigureAI.  Clearly, he sees a bright future for humanoid robots as well. And guess who else is investing in FigureAI? Bezos’ old company, Amazon. The titan is pouring $50 million into FigureAI. So is Microsoft, with a $95 million commitment to the startup – not to mention $50 million from Nvidia, too. Or how about OpenAI? The ChatGPT creator is already FigureAI’s biggest investor, and it’s throwing another $5 million into the firm. Plus, Intel (INTC) and Samsung are also reportedly investing in FigureAI right now as well. Folks, it seems the writing is on the wall.  You may think of AI-powered humanoid robots as a mere sci-fi concept. But as with the world’s most powerful people, the foremost AI innovators clearly think humanoid robots are the next frontier, too. They see them as AI 2.0. And they’re dedicating millions of dollars to create this tech right now. We believe we’re seeing this boom’s next evolution unfold right now. And that means it’s time to grab your slice of the pie. Find out how to do just that right now with a few of our favorite stock picks.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Web3 stocks could reshape our digital future, ushering in an era of rapid growth and innovation. To put it plainly, the Web3 phenomenon is a paradigm shift, facilitating the creation of an ‘Internet of value.’ It promises a future where digital assets can be seamlessly issued, owned and transferred, effectively revolutionizing digital assets’ ownership, value creation and transfer. With such breakthroughs, money will become more productive, ultimately benefitting the broader economy. Moreover, despite the short-term concerns, the long-term potential of Web3 stocks is tough to deny. As we venture into this digital frontier, Web3 stocks can potentially drive forward the next wave of internet evolution. That said, here are three Web3 stocks that are leading the charge in the sector. Unity Software (NYSE:U) has been dabbling in several emerging technologies, and Web3 is no different. Though not a pure play, its immersive 3D environments and development tools will likely play a critical role in laying the Web3 architecture. Its versatile content creation platform continues to evolve, seamlessly integrating revolutionary new technologies to expand its market share further.  It added several functionalities last year that aim to effectively weave blockchain, NFTs and cryptocurrencies into its ecosystem. The goal is to empower creators to develop decentralized applications and virtual assets while creating new avenues for gaming experiences. Web3 gaming could become massive over time, considering that blockchain-based gaming witnessed a whopping 2000% increase from 2021 to 2022. Unity, in particular, is pushing towards marrying game development with the burgeoning Web3 gaming sphere, potentially adding new chapters to its illustrious growth story. Applied Digital (NASDAQ:APLD) is another top Web3 stock that powers the infrastructure behind transformative technology. APLD develops and operates data centers that are pivotal in running powerful computer programs, including those needed in crypto mining and blockchain. Its supercharged data centers are energy efficient and facilitate the creation of decentralized apps (dApps), key components of the Web3 vision. From a financial standpoint, the company is doing well, ending last year with record sales at $55.4 million. Moreover, it maintained momentum in 2024, with back-to-back quarters of spectacular top-line expansion. In its most recent quarter, revenues were up a stunning 243.1% year-over-year (YOY) to $42.2 million, roughly 76% of its full-year sales figure in 2023. As we advance, the company remains incredibly optimistic, projecting the fiscal year 2024 exit with revenue and EBITDA run rates soaring to $500 million and $250 million, respectively. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has its hand in virtually every tech pie, and Web3 is no exception to this trend. It’s poised to play a critical role through its cloud computing behemoth, Amazon Web Services (AWS).  Cloud computing provides the muscle needed to run the networks that Web3 relies on, such as blockchain and dApps. Services such as AWS offer the infrastructure and related tools that allow Web3 projects to operate smoothly, securely and at scale. This means that as the sector evolves, AWS stands to benefit tremendously, becoming a backbone of the decentralized web. Many analysts consider AWS alone a trillion-dollar entity, and its impressive numbers each quarter continue to add more weight to those claims. Amazon ended last year with AWS sales reaching an eye-catching $90.76 billion, up an incredible 13.3% over last year’s $80.10 billion. AWS accounts for about 16% of Amazon’s total sales, which grows steadily each year.

      "Remarks from Federal Reserve officials alongside new economic data significantly shaped investor sentiment over the last week. The U.S. economy continues to demonstrate resilience, with the manufacturing sector returning to expansion after 16 months of contraction and the labor market adding 303,000 new jobs in March, surpassing economist expectations. Buoyed by this positive economic momentum, recent public statements from Federal Reserve officials have tempered expectations of an imminent interest rate cut, with Fed governors reiterating the need to see more positive data on disinflation. Wall Street saw a varied performance this week, with uncertainty regarding monetary policy taking the spotlight. Energy stocks, as tracked by the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLE), notably stood out as oil prices surged to their highest levels in over six months, inching closer to $90 a barrel. Apple’s Robotics Ambition  Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is reportedly shifting its focus from electric vehicle ambitions to home robotics, reflecting its continual search for the next big innovation. Initiatives include a mobile robot and a sophisticated tabletop device with a display repositioning arm aimed at redefining smart home technology. Analysts have expressed differing opinions on the possibility of Apple venturing into the realm of personal home robots. Disney's Board Wins Vote Disney Co. (NYSE:DIS) shareholders overwhelmingly supported the company's current board, decisively defeating activist shareholder nominees from Trian and Blackwell. This result solidifies CEO Bob Iger‘s leadership as Disney aims to focus on growth, value creation and maintaining its position in the entertainment industry. Demand Overwhelms Supply  Eli Lilly Co. (NYSE:LLY) faces challenges meeting the high demand for its weight loss drugs Mounjaro and Zepbound, with shortages reported on Amazon Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) Pharmacy. This situation underscores the drugs’ success and the company’s efforts to scale up manufacturing capacity. EV Penny Stock Rallies Nikola Corp. (NASDAQ:NKLA), an electric truck manufacturer, has outperformed major companies like Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Rivian Automotive Inc. (NYSE:RVN) and Lucid Group Inc. (NASDAQ:LCID) in stock performance terms so far in 2024. This growth comes after a tough 2023 for Nikola that saw stock value dips, recalls and leadership changes. Nikola’s focus on hydrogen fuel cell trucks contributes to its share price recovery, in contrast with the broader EV market’s downturn.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Laying a strong financial foundation early in life is crucial when choosing stocks for young investors. Taking advantage of the power of compounding allows even modest investments to grow significantly over extended periods. In other words, small, regular contributions can snowball into a significant nest egg over time. The historical performance of the S&P 500 index, averaging around a 10% annual return with dividends reinvested, exemplifies the wealth-creation potential of equities. Thus, the key is to invest wisely, choosing assets, especially robust stocks, with the potential for long-term growth. However, sifting through many stocks and navigating the world of ETFs can feel overwhelming. This article simplifies some of the processes, especially for young readers. Today, we’ll explore three stocks for young investors to build wealth steadily in the years ahead. Known for its unparalleled long-term track record, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) is led by the legendary investor Warren Buffett. Investors eagerly follow Berkshire Hathaway’s annual shareholder meetings, where Buffett and colleagues share sage wisdom. Over the past six decades, Berkshire Hathaway stock has appreciated at an impressive 20% compound annual growth rate, outperforming the S&P 500 by a wide margin. The power of compounding has resulted in remarkable returns for shareholders, making it a compelling choice among our stocks for young investors.  Berkshire focuses on acquiring high-quality companies with strong competitive advantages and strong balance sheets. Management released the fourth quarter and full 2023 results in late February. Net earnings came in at $17.36 per share compared with $8.24 for the same period 12 months ago. Moreover, full-year earnings per share (“EPS) for 2023 was $44.27 versus a loss of $10.33 for 2022. In addition to a jump in operating earnings, the company’s cash holding surged to record levels. So far in 2024, BRK-B stock has advanced 16%, changing hands at 21.9 times forward earnings. Meanwhile, BRK-B’s 12-month median price forecast stands at $453.61, giving an upside potential of 9% from current levels. For young investors, owning a piece of Berkshire Hathaway can be a smart move toward building long-term wealth. Leading e-commerce platform provider Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) is next among our stocks for young investors. The company benefits significantly from the sustained shift towards online shopping worldwide. Fourth quarter revenue grew 24% year-over-year (YOY) to $2.14 billion, translating to even stronger 30% growth after adjusting for the sales of its logistics businesses. Adjusted EPS also surged, reaching $0.34 compared to $0.07 in the prior-year quarter. Free cash flow more than quadrupled YOY as the company moved deeper into positive cash flow territory. E-commerce is projected to continue strong growth in the coming years, while Shopify sits at the heart of this trend, providing merchants with an all-in-one platform. Given its expanding margins, loyal customer base and commitment to innovation, analysts forecast a 35% revenue growth in 2024.  Yet, SHOP stock has lost 4% year-to-date (YTD), offering a better entry point for new investors. However, we should note that shares still command a premium at 14x trailing sales. Meanwhile, Wall Street’s 12-month price target of $85.00 suggests a potential upside of around 14% from current levels. While Shopify’s stock price will likely be volatile the rest of the year, long-term investors could regard $70 as a better entry point. As one of the most actively traded ETFs globally, the SPDR S&P 500  ETF (NYSEARCA:SPY) is the final name on our list of stocks for young investors. The SPY fund tracks the performance of the benchmark S&P 500 index, which measures the stock performance of the largest publicly-traded 500 companies stateside that make up around 80% of the overall U.S. stock market’s value. SPY offers broad exposure to these U.S. businesses’ growth and profitability potential, mitigating single-stock concentration risk. Due to its capitalization-weighted structure, large, well-established firms hold a substantial weighting within the index, influencing their overall performance. Launched in 1993 as the first US-listed ETF, SPY holds over $530 billion in assets. The five largest names in SPY include  Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), accounting for a quarter of the fund’s roster. SPY has gained 8% YTD, while the fund’s top 10 holdings have significantly outperformed the broader market. Yet, the current valuation appears slightly expensive, with trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-book (P/B) ratios of 22.0 and 4.5, respectively. A potential decline towards $500 or below during the upcoming earnings season would mean a more opportune entry point for long-term investors.

      "Mizuho analyst James Lee reiterated a Buy rating on Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) with a price target of $230. Following Lee’s latest quarterly survey with a prominent AWS channel partner, he noted several promising developments. He said an accelerated sales cycle indicated by an increase in executive business center (EBC) meetings and early terminations of on-premises data center contracts; a significant shift in fiscal 2024 budgets towards infrastructure expenditure, hinting at a quicker migration to AWS; and an expectation for consumption to revert to traditional growth rates, suggesting a 20% year-over-year increase in AWS spending. Consequently, his confidence in AWS’s revenue growth accelerating into fiscal 2024 has strengthened, leading him to reiterate Amazon as his top pick. Lee’s key findings include an accelerated sales cycle, evidenced by AWS customers arranging more EBC meetings involving senior executives (CEO, CFO, and CIO), which typically led to deals closing 30 days sooner than the usual sales cycle.  Additionally, customers are exiting their on-prem data center agreements more rapidly through prepayments, showcasing an increased pace in migration and sales cycle velocity. Lee’s survey also highlighted a budgetary shift towards infrastructure spending, increasing from 35% to 45%. This change is driven by AWS customers migrating significant data volumes into the cloud for long-term General AI deployment and upgrading existing cloud data to optimize for General AI through vectorized or unstructured data warehousing. Furthermore, Lee’s survey indicated a surge in proof of concept (POC) projects for new use cases across various sectors, underscoring the effectiveness of AWS’s Bedrock service. This service facilitates access to large language models, including Anthropic’s Claude 3, and is vital in financial services, healthcare, and manufacturing.  Given these positive trends and a forecasted 20% year-over-year AWS spending growth—exceeding the consensus of 15%—Lee maintained Amazon as his Top Pick. The $230 price target is based on a 14x fiscal 2026 EBITDA multiplier, reflecting our anticipation of AWS continuing to outperform. Lee projected first-quarter revenue and EPS of $141.09 billion and $0.82. Price Action: AMZN shares traded higher by 3.10% at $185.56 on the last check Friday.

      "With interest rates remaining at their highest levels in over two decades, and with U.S. Treasury bonds comfortably exceeding a 4% yield, an increasing number of investors are turning their attention to the realm of corporate bonds. In this landscape, they seek not only promising yield opportunities but also the strategic advantage of diversifying away from equity investments. The Financial Times recently reported that inflows into corporate bond funds have surged to $22.8 billion in 2024, marking the first positive start to a year since 2019. Corporate bonds come in two main types: investment-grade and high-yield. Investment-grade bonds are issued by financially stable companies, while high-yield (or speculative grade) bonds come from riskier firms but offer higher returns. Rating agencies like S&P, Fitch and Moody’s determine which category a bond falls into based on the issuer’s ability to repay debts. Ratings range from AAA (very safe) to D (in default).  For example, companies like Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Eli Lilly Company (NYSE:LLY) and Walt Disney Co. (NYSE:DIS) are rated as investment grade. Conversely, firms like AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. (NYSE:AMC), Office Property Income Trust (NYSE:OPI) and Navient Corporation (NASDAQ:NAVI) belong to the speculative-grade world. Read also: Top 10 US High-Yield Corporate Bonds With Returns Over 20% In April 2024 The cutoff between investment-grade and high-yield is at the BB+ rating. Anything below BB+ is considered high yield, while BBB- or higher is investment-grade. In general, the riskier the bond, the higher the potential return. Investment-grade bonds tend to offer lower yields because they are safer bets, with stronger financial health and better chances of repayment.  However, even within the realm of investment-grade bonds, there are opportunities to find attractive yields from companies with solid fundamentals. This allows investors to earn better returns without taking on excessive risk, compared to investing solely in ultra-safe U.S. Treasuries. Benzinga used the Public.com bond screener to discover which investment-grade corporate bonds offer the best yield as of April 2024. Below are the top 10 investment-grade corporate bonds with the highest yields: Read now: Top 10 US Corporate Bonds By Market Performance In 2024: April Update  Image generated using artificial intelligence with Midjourney.\n"

      "HubSpot Inc (NYSE:HUBS) shares are trading higher on continued upward momentum following a report suggesting Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is in talks with advisors about a potential offer for the company. Piper Sandler analyst Brent Bracelin maintained HubSpot shares as Overweight with a $675 price target. Bracelin has long noted that IaaS could be natural consolidators of a highly fragmented SaaS landscape. The transition from traditional client-server applications to cloud computing models over the past 20+ years has created a proliferation of SaaS applications that today include 100+ publics and 1,000+ privates, Bracelin said. Private equity firms such as Thoma Bravo and Vista Equity Partners have been the most prolific consolidators of the SaaS ecosystem over the past three to five years. The analyst flagged Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Oracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL) as the only two cloud platforms operating over $10 billion IaaS platforms alongside over $10 billion SaaS application suites.  Bracelin argued that Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet could move higher up the stack into SaaS applications. HubSpot was a SaaS pioneer that has expanded revenue to plus $2 billion since it was founded in 2006, he said. The analyst believed the combination of Google Workspace and the HubSpot Customer Platform makes strategic sense. HubSpot has 205K paid customers, with an average size of 25 employees per customer, while Google Workspace has 9 million paid customers. Bracelin said the potential cross-sell of HubSpot SaaS applications into a large Google Workspace installed base could be compelling. According to Gartner, HubSpot has captured a small slice of the $22 billion CRM marketing software industry with just a 4.9% market share in 2022. The two most prominent platforms in CRM marketing include Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) (15% share) and Adobe Inc (NASDAQ:ADBE) (15% share). Canaccord Genuity analyst Richard Davis maintained HubSpot with a Buy and raised the price target from $700 to $750.  HubSpot stock gained 67% in the past 12 months. Investors can gain exposure to the stock via Sterling Capital Focus Equity ETF (NYSE:LCG) and Spear Alpha ETF (NASDAQ:SPRX).

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Investors looking to capture the continued growth in e-commerce would do well to invest in the three stocks outlined below. Traditional brick and mortar retail continues to struggle. Even with the lifting of pandemic restrictions, there isn’t much hope for a continued rebound.  Technology has greatly increased the convenience of the retail experience. Internet connectivity is ubiquitous and smartphones are a vital part of our daily lives. Those factors have conspired to create a boon for the e-commerce industry. E-commerce revenues are expected to grow at 9.5% annually over each of the next four years. It all suggests that investing in e-commerce stocks is a wise choice. The e-commerce landscape is diverse but there are a few dominant players at the same time. It continues to make sense to invest in those firms. At the same time, there are other important global players that investors should also consider. Let’s take a look at them. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is far and away the biggest e-commerce firm globally. Any list of e-commerce stocks would be incomplete without the inclusion of Amazon.  Just how big is it?  Total sales reached $574.8 billion in 2023. That was an increase of 12% over the previous year. However, that also includes substantial contributions outside of e-commerce from sources including Amazon’s AWS Cloud among others. Amazon reported $412.1 billion in online sales in 2023. That still doesn’t tell us just how big Amazon is. Consider this: Prime membership subscriptions accounted for more than $40 billion in revenues in 2023. Those revenues alone would make it the third-largest retailer if the company were isolated along those lines. Such a large size naturally raises questions about growth potential. Amazon’s ecommerce business nearly doubled between 2019 and 2023. In my mind that provides a strong counterpoint to such concerns. Amazon remains the first and best choice among e-commerce stocks. MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) is another prominent name in the world of e-commerce and a company that is often compared to Amazon. The company serves the Latin American market from Mexico to Argentina. It has carved out a dominant position in Latin American e-commerce which has sent its stock much much higher. The company is part e-commerce champion and part fintech superstar. Overall revenues grew by 42% in the most recent quarter. Mercado Libre is the rare company that dominates its region while simultaneously experiencing hyper growth. On the fintech side, MercadoLibre saw payments volume increase by more than 57% in the 4th quarter. The company’s Mercado Pago offering has served to bring customers to its platform and is very clearly growing at a rapid pace.  The company served nearly 85 million unique buyers in 2023 overall. Some investors May worry that MercadoLibre’s growth is limited due to demographic trends. Latin America, like many parts of the world, is undergoing demographic stagnation. However, the company clearly can continue to penetrate the markets it already dominates and reach substantial untapped customers. Walmart (NYSE:WMT) is much better known for traditional brick-and-mortar retail than e-commerce. The company continually battles against Amazon for overall retail dominance. That means Walmart continues to challenge Amazon concerning e-commerce. Walmart is doing very well in that regard. E-commerce sales eclipsed the $100 million mark for the first time in 2023. During the 4th quarter online sales grew by 17% in the U.S. at Walmart. Online sales grew 23% globally during the same period. The number of Walmart marketplace sellers increased by 20% during the same time. That’s a strong sign in relation to its competitiveness with Amazon where marketplace sellers had long flocked. Walmart continues to establish itself as a more e-commerce oriented firm of late. Meanwhile, it continues to dominate brick-and-mortar retail and remains the largest grocery store in the United States. It’s a great stock overall and one for e-commerce investors to consider as well.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips The quantum computing industry is still in its relatively early stages, which means many companies in this space could be trading at attractive valuations compared to their long-term growth potential. This provides opportunities for the most undervalued quantum computing stocks to buy in April. One reason for undervaluation is the high degree of uncertainty surrounding the timeline for widespread commercialization and adoption of quantum computing. Some big brands, such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and IBM (NYSE:IBM), might not be considered undervalued given that they are blue-chips in their own right. Investors should explore more speculative names for the best bargains. Additionally, many prominent quantum computing players are still pre-revenue or in the early stages of generating meaningful sales. Traditional valuation metrics like price-to-earnings may not yet be applicable, leaving investors to rely more on future growth projections, which can be difficult to assess accurately. However, the most undervalued quantum computing stocks to buy in April could be long term winners. Here are three companies to consider.  IonQ (NYSE:IONQ) focuses exclusively on quantum computing, offering quantum computing systems across major public cloud services. With a market cap of around 1.9 billion, it’s also small enough to ride the ups and downs of the market while still being robust enough to withstand volatility. It also means there could be plenty of upside, which may make it undervalued. For 2024, IONQ has set its revenue expectations between $37 million and $41 million, with bookings projected to range from $70 million to $90 million. However, the company anticipates an adjusted EBITDA loss of approximately $110.5 million. Its EBITDA loss helps make it undervalued. In the long term, its prospects are attractive. In terms of valuation, it trades at a forward price-to-sales multiple of 47 times sales. Still, this is relatively low compared to analysts’ long-term revenue growth rate, which is another hint of trading below its intrinsic value. Rigetti Computing (NASDAQ:RGTI) specializes in developing quantum integrated circuits and a cloud platform for quantum algorithms. RGTI could be one of the most undervalued quantum computing stocks on this list, as its market cap is just 219 million at the time of writing, so there’s substantial room for it to head higher. Its forward P/E ratio of 13 times sales underlines this undervalued nature.  Financially, there’s also some evidence that RGTI could be undervalued, and the company’s best is yet to come. In the fourth quarter of 2023, RGTI reported revenues of $3.4 million, a decrease from $6.1 million in 2022. The gross margin stood at 75%, slightly declining from 87% in the fourth quarter of 2022. The net loss for Q4 2023 improved to $12.6 million, or $0.09 per share, from a net loss of $22.9 million, or $0.19 per share. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), with its AWS Braket service, provides a platform for experimenting with quantum computing. I think that AMZN could be one of the most undervalued FAANG stocks and one of the most underappreciated quantum players in the quantum computing industry. AWS Braket is designed to speed up scientific research and software development for quantum computing. It particularly stands out with the launch of IonQ Aria, the first Quantum Processing Unit (QPU) on Braket to feature built-in error mitigation techniques. On the financial front, Amazon demonstrated robust performance in the fourth quarter, reporting record operating profits of $13.2 billion, a substantial increase from the previous year’s $2.7 billion. Amazon’s revenue also surged by 14% year-over-year to $169.9 billion.  With many developers already familiar with the tools provided by AWS and its related certifications, it gives it a significant leg up over its competitors, thus making it a strong contender for the top spot in the quantum computing industry.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Despite being a leader in the rollout of artificial intelligence products, Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock hasn’t set the world on fire lately. That might be about to change. Year to date, Microsoft stock is up 13%, which is a little better than the 11% gain achieved by the benchmark S&P 500 index. In the last 12 months, the technology giant’s stock has risen 46%. While decent, the gains pale in comparison to those achieved by other companies that are closely associated with AI. Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock is up 225% over the last year while Meta Platforms’ (NASDAQ:META) share price has increased 136%. Of course, Microsoft is more than an AI company. But it is AI that is likely to drive the company’s sales and profits, and share price, moving forward. Microsoft has been making big bets on AI ever since it invested $10 billion into privately held OpenAI, the company whose AI chatbots took the world by storm last year. More recently, Microsoft has announced plans to build a massive data center to run AI software that could require an investment of $100 billion. That would be an incredible investment considering that Microsoft’s total capital spending over the last four years combined was $104 billion.  The data center investment, which also involves plans to develop an AI supercomputer called “Stargate” for launch in 2028, is the latest example of Microsoft going all-in on AI.  In February of this year, Microsoft announced that it is ramping up its investments in AI around the world, pledging to spend $5.60 billion in Europe alone. At the same time that it is increasing its spending, Microsoft is also pushing to monetize the technology and boost its sales and profits. The best example of the monetization efforts can be found with Microsoft Copilot, the company’s AI chatbot or assistant. Microsoft is now charging subscriptions of $30 a month for access to Copilot, and Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives forecasts that it could add $25 billion to $30 billion to Microsoft’s revenues by 2025. Ives recently boosted his price target on MSFT stock to $500 from $475 and stated that the “AI revolution is here.” Also citing the monetization of Copilot, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) maintained a “buy” rating on Microsoft’s stock and a $480 price target, calling the company a “top pick.” Beyond AI, there are many other business units that are accelerating and benefitting Microsoft. These include the Xbox unit following the successful $69 billion acquisition of video game maker Activision Blizzard, and the Azure cloud-computing segment. Cloud was a particular bright spot in Microsoft’s fourth quarter 2023 earnings report. The company reported that revenue from Azure and other cloud services grew 30% year over year in Q4. Analysts had forecast growth of 27.7%. Microsoft stock now has 53,000 Azure AI customers, and one-third of them are new to Azure in the past year, said the company in its earnings release. Commitments to spend more than $1 billion on Azure cloud services in the year ahead increased during  Q4 2023. Today, Microsoft is the second largest cloud-computing company in the world after Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Data from the Synergy Research Group shows that Microsoft’s Azure infrastructure controls 20% of the world’s $130 billion cloud market. Together, Amazon and Microsoft control 52% of the global cloud market, and cloud-computing remains a huge growth driver at Microsoft.  Microsoft stock achieved a milestone earlier this year when its market capitalization surpassed $3 trillion and it became the biggest publicly traded company in the world. Going forward, more growth and gains can be expected, especially as the company monetizes its AI offerings. With leading role in areas ranging from not only AI but also video games, cloud-computing, and software, Microsoft remains a best-in-class technology concern that should be part of every investors’ portfolio. MSFT stock is a buy. On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in NVDA and MSFT.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Investing in stocks and other assets can lead to a better retirement. Investments compound over time and have the potential to deliver exceptional long-term returns. Some investors focus on growth stocks while others are getting closer to retirement. This has led to this list of the best retirement stocks to buy in April. Retirement stocks still have the potential to generate positive returns. However, these corporations often give out lofty dividends or have enticing dividend growth rates. A few retirement stocks don’t offer dividends quite yet but have delivered good gains and look prime for dividends in the future. Investors looking to build retirement portfolios may want to consider these best retirement stocks to buy in April. Visa (NYSE:V) is on its way to a $1 trillion market cap. The credit and debit card issuer makes a percentage of each transaction and is a barometer for consumer spending. The stock can rally during good economic conditions and doesn’t experience sharp downturns during slower economic cycles.  Visa stock only lost 4% of its value in 2022. During this down year for the stock market, many growth stocks shed 20% to 50% of their value. Even when consumers slow down their spending, they still use their credit and debit cards to make purchases. The fintech company reported another solid quarter to start fiscal 2024. During the first quarter, the company reported 9% year-over-year revenue growth and 17% year-over-year net income growth. Visa regularly maintains profit margins above 50% and continues to expand them. The stock is up by 76% over the past five years and offers a 0.75% dividend  yield. Visa tends to hike its dividend by at least 10% each year. This makes it one of to Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) is a leading consumer staples stock that offers many home care products and other essentials. The stock isn’t likely to beat the market, but it offers stability during volatile times. The company continues to grow, albeit at a slower pace. Procter & Gamble reported 3% year-over-year revenue growth in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 and a non-GAAP core EPS growth of 16% year-over-year. The company maintained its fiscal year sales and cash return guidance while raising its core EPS growth guidance. Procter & Gamble has many brands under its umbrella like Gilette, Tide, and Herbal Essences. The company’s top three segments are Fabric & Home Care, Baby, Feminine, & Family Care, and Beauty. Health Care and Grooming are the company’s two other segments. All in all, it’s one of those best retirement stocks to buy in April.  Retirees will be happy to see that Procter & Gamble has been distributing dividends for 133 consecutive years. That includes 67 consecutive years of dividend hikes. Dividend growth has slowed down in recent years, but the stock offers a 2.41% yield just for buying shares. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) doesn’t offer a dividend but seems like a prime candidate for a future program. The company’s profit margins expanded in 2023 as it continues to tap into compelling opportunities like its online marketplace, cloud computing, advertising, and video streaming. Most people do their online shopping with Amazon, and the company also has a big lead in the cloud computing industry. The stock has been doing well and is up by 78% over the past year. Amazon is a staple in many index and mutual funds. It’s a key component of the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 that has significantly impacted each of these indices’ performances. The c company recently reported record sales in the fourth quarter of 2023. Overall sales increased by 14% year-over-year while Amazon Web Services saw a 13% year-over-year jump in revenue. The stock has rewarded many long-term investors and looks poised to consider that trend. Watsco (NYSE:WSO) is an HVAC company that offers consistent growth and rising earnings. The company has a 5-year annual revenue growth rate of 9.88%. During that same stretch, the company has raised its dividend by an average of 11.84% per year.  The company has been distributing dividends for decades while rewarding shareholders with long-term returns. The stock is up by 187% over the past five years and offers a 2.51% dividend yield. Shares also trade at a 31 P/E ratio. Watsco continued to grow its business year-over-year and gain market share during a soft market. The firm also hiked its dividend by 10% to reach an annualized $10.80 per share. The company took a breather after posting record results in 2021 and 2022. The company is exploring acquisitions to tap into additional growth and has acquired 69 successful companies since 1989. Watsco’s “buy and build” strategy has been working and can lead to higher portfolio values. Main Street Capital (NYSE:MAIN) offers monthly dividend distributions for its investors. Retirees can use their income to cover various expenses without having to sell their shares. The stock also offers an enticing 6% dividend yield and is up by 8% year-to-date. Shares trade at a 9 P/E ratio. The principal investment firm gives out debt to lower middle market companies and has several parameters in place. This market is relatively underserved, and Main Street Capital will only work with companies that have revenue between $10 million and $150 million. The company must also have EBITDA that ranges from $3 million to $20 million. Main Street Capital’s portfolio consists of 190 companies with an average investment size of $18.7 million. The company’s assets are diversified into numerous industries and are spread evenly throughout the United States. The firm has allocated 26% of its assets to companies in the West Coast and 14% of its assets to companies in the Southeast United States. The Northeast, Midwest, and middle Southern States have percentages that fall in between those numbers.  Investors who want diversified portfolios and steady dividend payments may want to give Main Street Capital a closer look. Cintas (NASDAQ:CTAS) offers business supplies and safety equipment. Those products will always remain in demand and have helped the company command respectable profit margins. The company continued this trend in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 by posting a 15.8% net profit margin. Revenue increased by 9.9% year-over-year while net income jumped by 15.5% year-over-year. The company only has a 0.80% dividend yield but makes up for it with an impressive growth rate. Cintas hiked its dividend by 17.1% year-over-year, and that type of growth rate has been normal for the company. Cintas raised its full-year guidance from the range of $9.48 billion to $9.56 billion to the range of $9.57 billion to $9.60 billion. The company also hiked its EPS guidance. The midpoint of the old guidance was $14.50 per share while the new guidance suggests a midpoint of $14.90 per share. It’s a good sign when a company with healthy profit margins decides to raise guidance. The stock has steadily outperformed the market and is up by 229% over the past five years. Walmart (NYSE:WMT) offers a combination of steady business fundamentals and growth opportunities. Many people go to the retailer to save money, and inflation has been attracting people who would normally skip Walmart. The company has been attracting wealthier consumers and is offering some higher-end products to attract more people from this customer segment.  The stock offers a 1.40% dividend yield and is up by 80% over the past five years. Walmart also has a 31 P/E ratio. The corporation raised its dividend by 9% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. Revenue increased by 5.7% year-over-year during that quarter. Advertising and e-commerce are promising growth drivers for the company. Global e-commerce sales increased by 23% year-over-year while advertising jumped by 33% year-over-year. Advertising has higher profit margins which can help Walmart maintain a high dividend growth rate for future quarters. The retail giant acquired Vizio to accelerate its growth in the advertising industry. This makes it one of those best retirement stocks to buy in April.

      "Amazon (AMZN – Research Report), the Consumer Cyclical sector company, was revisited by a Wall Street analyst yesterday. Analyst Jonathan Chappell from Evercore ISI maintained a Buy rating on the stock and has a $220.00 price target. Jonathan Chappell has given his Buy rating due to a combination of factors that indicate strong potential for margin expansion in Amazon’s North America Retail sector. Chappell’s assessment, in collaboration with expert Marc Wulfraat, points to Amazon’s expected flattish Retail Capital Expenditures through 2025, which suggests an improved utilization of the company’s extensive fulfillment network. This efficiency gain is anticipated to significantly drive operating margin expansion in the medium term, considering the excess capacity and dormant Fulfillment Centers (FCs) Amazon currently has.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, Wulfraat’s insights reveal a strategic reduction in new infrastructure buildout, with a notable decrease in Retail segment CapEx projections for Amazon extending into 2025-26. At the same time, Amazon’s Regional Network Strategy has been effective in lowering shipping costs, demonstrating an increase in the percentage of packages filled within a customer’s region. With the potential scale-up of Sub Same Day facilities, this operational strategy promises to further enhance Amazon’s logistical efficiencies and cost savings. These factors collectively underpin Chappell’s optimistic Buy rating for Amazon stock, underscoring the company’s robust path toward improved profitability. According to TipRanks, Chappell is a top 100 analyst with an average return of 23.8% and a 73.44% success rate. Chappell covers the Industrials sector, focusing on stocks such as Nordic American Tanker, Ardmore Shipping, and CH Robinson.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips China is a conundrum. With 900 million people, the country is the world’s biggest consumer market and United States companies love tapping into it. Whether it’s a new expansion opportunity or just a way to stave off slowing growth in more mature and saturated markets, companies eagerly do business there. Yet it’s problematic, too. Just ask these tech stock titans. Foremost is China’s use of slave labor. Human Rights Watch says the government uses Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslim communities in forced labor camps. Products including car parts, solar panels and apparel from businesses such as PDD Holdings‘ (NASDAQ:PDD) Temu and Schein are regularly sold in the U.S. And American companies as wide-ranging as Nike (NYSE:NKE) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) have endured scrutiny for tainting their supply chains by using forced labor products. The ongoing war in Ukraine also helped raise tensions between Washington and Beijing that spilled over into trade issues. President Biden imposed restrictions on the sale of semiconductors and advanced technology to China which retaliated with restrictions of its own. Not just in computer chips but by subsidizing local companies to challenge sales by U.S. corporations. Other businesses are simply prohibited from operating there. Twitter and Facebook are two companies banned over free speech fears. These three tech stocks facing China challenges face very high hurdles to spur sales growth.  One of the most high-profile fallouts from heightened trade tensions is China blocking Intel‘s (NASDAQ:INTC) chips from beiung used in government computers and servers. Reminiscent of the arguments U.S. politicians are using to ban TikTok or force its sale, China issued a list of “safe and reliable” CPUs, databases and operating systems companies could use. The products were all from Chinese companies. Also caught up in the ban are chips from Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Microsoft‘s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Windows operating system. But it’s a heavy blow to Intel, which was looking to China expansion to revitalize its growth efforts. Nearly 75% of Intel’s revenue comes from outside the U.S. China represents 27% of the chipmaker’s $54.2 billion total revenue, or almost $15 billion. The country also represents 15% of Advanced Micro’s $23 billion revenues. Intel’s stock is down 23% year to date as a result of disappointing guidance issued earlier this year. As trade war hawks in both political parties rail against China in an election year, don’t expect INTC stock to run much higher. It’s not just in the U.S. where the fervor for electric vehicles (EV) is subsiding. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) saw its market share in China slip to 6.6% in the first two months of 2024 from 7.6% last year as overall EV sales slowed. Coupled with increased competition from Chinese manufacturers like BYD (OTCMKTS:BDDYF), Nio (NYSE:NIO) and Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI), the going is getting tough for Tesla.  The EV maker reported first-quarter deliveries tumbled 8.5% to 386,810 vehicles where analysts had expected 457,000 deliveries. It also marked a 20% slide in sales sequentially. However, Tesla’s consolation prize was regaining the title of world’s largest EV maker after BYD reported deliveries plummeted 43% to 300,411 vehicles. All EV manufacturers are now locked in a price-cutting war that will likely decimate profits for the companies. Tesla slashed prices on its Model 3 and Model Y cars in China earlier this year. It also began offering cash discounts on Model Ys beginning Feb. 1. Now the EV maker is offering additional incentives on cars in China, including insurance, paint colors and financing options. It’s likely its rivals will respond as they did to Tesla’s earlier buyer enticements. Tesla stock is down 34% year-to-date and could go lower as sales slow and discounting heats up. Drop this and the other tech stock titans we mentioned. The third tech stock facing China challenges is Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). It saw iPhone shipments tumble 33% in February, according to Bloomberg News. There were only 2.4 million devices shipped that month but the number was affected by China’s Lunar New Year holiday. As Apple is the only cross-border company with a sizable market share in China, it bore the brunt of the decline. The tech giant has been working overtime to smooth relations in the country. CEO Tim Cook recently traveled to China to meet with government officials and open a new flagship store in Shanghai. He promised to increase Apple’s investment in China in the long run. With the new iPhone 16 due out later this year, Cook wants to ensure the road to sales is paved before its debut.  Apple also recently reached a $490 million settlement with plaintiffs in a class-action lawsuit. They alleged Cook lied to shareholders in 2019 by concealing just how bad the iPhone was selling in China. Apple surprised the market by slashing quarterly revenue forecasts by $9 billion on declining demand in China. The situation is emblematic of the ongoing difficulty U.S. companies face when doing business there. Apple stock is down 12% so far this year. This and the other tech stock titans we have mentioned need to be dropped soon.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Investment managers tend to flock to a select group of outperforming stocks that drive consistent returns. The stocks top money managers can’t live without generally hail from sectors like technology, healthcare and consumer staples. However, tech reigns supreme, hosting stocks that permeate most portfolios. In particular, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) represent core technology holdings found among an overwhelming majority of money managers. For instance, Apple constitutes Warren Buffett’s top position at Berkshire Hathaway, making up over 40% of its holdings. Meanwhile, Ken Fisher, Mairs and Power, Philippe Laffont’s Coatue Management and Fidelity’s Contrafund all share top stakes in Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon as well. Exciting AI and metaverse plays like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) entice more risk-tolerant managers. However, Microsoft, Appl and Amazon remain the cherished stocks top money managers can’t live without thanks to their dominant positions and immense growth runways in cloud computing, e-commerce and beyond. This article explores why these big tech companies represent such a significant allocation across top investment managers’ portfolios. With its strong fundamentals and competitive edge, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is undoubtedly one of the stocks top money managers can’t live without. As many portfolio managers have wisely realized, Microsoft is exceptionally positioned for long-term outperformance. This is especially obvious when taking into account the near monopoly the company holds across some of the company’s key business segments.  Powering Microsoft’s success is its cloud dominance. The tech titan’s robust cloud platform remains unrivaled, fueling its Q2 2024 revenue growth to $62 billion, up 18% year-over-year. Such financial strength confirms Microsoft’s near monopoly status in major tech sectors. Plus, with sturdy operating income up 33% to $27 billion for the quarter, Microsoft has the backing to continue expanding its cloud, AI and metaverse lead. Adding to its upside potential, Microsoft is making big metaverse moves — evidenced by its monumental $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard last October. This deal fortifies Microsoft’s supremacy in gaming while allowing for tremendous metaverse monetization ahead. With gaming revenue already up 61% in Q2 2024, Microsoft is clearly on track to deliver metaverse profits down the road. Given its cloud dominance, metaverse momentum and exceptional growth metrics this quarter, Microsoft epitomizes one of the key stocks top money managers can’t live without for both present returns and future-forward gains. Its coveted brand and dominant position in consumer technology make Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) one of the favored stocks top money managers can’t live without. The iPhone maker continues to ride on hardware sales and services revenue, surpassing Wall Street estimates. In its latest earnings report for the first quarter of fiscal 2024, ending Dec. 31, 2023, Apple posted over $119 billion in quarterly revenue, an increase of 2% YoY. Fueled by robust iPhone demand during the holiday season, Apple even faced supply chain constraints that limited sales growth. Still, the results beat expectations. This resilience confirms why Apple remains a favorite among institutional investors and top money managers.  Bolstering its hardware ecosystem further, Apple recently unveiled a mixed-reality headset called Vision Pro in January 2024. The $3,499 premium device with both AR and VR capabilities targets creative professionals and showcases Apple’s ambitions in futuristic technologies. Although niche for now, it expands Apple’s total addressable market. With immense brand loyalty and an installed base exceeding 1.8 billion active devices globally, Apple retains pricing power and stable revenues. Top money managers see these qualities as enduring competitive strengths no matter the economic climate. Additionally, Apple’s services segment hit an all-time revenue record of $23.1 billion last quarter, up 11%. Offerings like Apple Music, iCloud, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade and more drive this high-margin recurring revenue stream. Such resilience makes Apple one of the stocks top money managers can’t live without, even amidst market uncertainty. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has firmly established itself as one of the stocks top money managers can’t live without thanks to its dominant position in global e-commerce and cloud computing. The company reported staggering net sales of $574.8 billion in 2023, up 12% year-over-year. Operating income also soared to $36.9 billion, triple that of the previous year. Driving this growth is Amazon’s core online retail segment, which continues to make up a significant portion of total sales. However, its true crown jewel is Amazon Web Services (AWS) — the company’s cloud computing arm. AWS raked in revenue of $91 billion in 2023, with operating margins hitting a superb 30%. With the global cloud market expected to hit $1.6 trillion by 2030, AWS provides an immense growth runway. Geographically, too, Amazon still has plenty of room to expand. Online shopping only accounts for 16% of total U.S. retail sales, a number that Amazon has greatly influenced. By securing nearly 40% of all U.S. e-commerce spending, Amazon is poised to benefit tremendously as more shopping moves online. Given these outstanding fundamentals and growth prospects, it is no wonder that money managers view Amazon as a core long-term holding. Nearly every major mutual fund has a sizable stake in Amazon stock. With dominant positions in two high-growth markets, Amazon remains undoubtedly one of the stocks top money managers can’t live without.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Dividends offer income and increase your total return on stocks. And, this income will grow with the best dividend growth stocks to buy in April. When choosing, consider two critical factors. First, candidates must be in stable industries that guarantee earnings growth in any economic environment. While some cyclical companies might pay high yields currently, these dividends are prone to cuts when earnings fall during a downturn. Secondly, the following three companies already have a strong dividend record. For starters, their forward dividend yield is above 2% and each has recorded over 10 consecutive years of dividend growth. Even better, they have grown their dividends by more than 10% annually over the last five years. Given their stellar dividend growth, these stocks are a great source of portfolio income. You can buy them today below the 21 times earnings in which the market is trading.  This regulated utility with a growing renewable energy business has a 3.25% forward dividend yield. Additionally, NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) has increased its dividend for 28 consecutive years. Also, the utility has achieved a 10.8% five-year dividend growth rate and this record is likely to continue. First, it owns Florida Power & Light Company, the largest electric utility in the U.S. As a regulated utility with a monopoly position in Florida, it charges prices that allow a good earnings return on capital. Secondly, it’s the largest producer of renewable energy from solar and wind through NextEra Energy Resources. NextEra has some of the best sites for renewable power generation on its portfolio. Moreover, it has entered into purchase power agreements with terms exceeding 20 years. These contracts include escalator clauses that guarantee the renewable business will earn good returns. Given the stability of its regulated utility business in Florida and the growth from the renewable business, NextEra presents as one of the best dividend growth stocks to buy. With a payout ratio below 60%, ample room for future dividend growth exists. Snacking is a favorite pastime for many people, regardless of their financial situation. That’s why Mondelez International (NASDAQ:MDLZ) continues to be a stable revenue grower. At 20 times forward earnings and a forward dividend yield of 2.4%, it’s a no-brainer buy.  Mondelez is a huge international player, with 70% of its sales from outside the U.S. Notably, the snack company has some of the most popular brands and garners significant shelf space in retail stores. Indeed, its dominant position is undisputed. According to management, it has a 17% market share in biscuits and a 13% share in confectionery. Its leading brands have supported steady demand growth and market share gains. As a result, over the last 5 years, revenue grew at a compounded annual growth rate of 6.7%. Impressively, the company has achieved volume growth while raising prices. This highlights consumers’ affinity for its top brands, such as Oreo and Cadbury. Also, Mondelez has achieved impressive profits, with operating margins exceeding 15% in the last five years. As of this writing, Mondelez International has a 48% payout ratio. Management expects 3%- 5% organic sales growth in fiscal year 2024. Moreover, they forecast adjusted EPS to grow at a high single-digit rate, meaning the 10-year dividend growth record will be extended. Target (NYSE:TGT) is one of the retailers that has managed to fight off competition from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and grow. By creating a fulfilling in-store experience and a broad assortment of essentials, home goods and apparel, it maintains customer interest. At the same time, it has built its omnichannel fulfillment capabilities to cater to the online shopper.  Indeed, Target has established itself as one of the leading retailers in the U.S. Although fiscal year 2023 sales declined 1.6%, they were still 37% above fiscal year 2019 levels. Even more impressive is Target’s dividend record. The retailer is a dividend aristocrat that has grown its dividend for 55 consecutive years. As earnings have grown, it has upped its dividend growth, increasing the dividend by 11.5% annually over the last five years. As of this writing, it yields 2.47% and has a low payout ratio of 48.8%. Fundamentally, the stock is also attractive at current levels. It has resolved most of the shrink and inventory issues it experienced over the past two years. Fiscal year 2023 GAAP EPS of $8.94 rose significantly from $5.98 in fiscal year 2022. And management expects even more improvements in 2024.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Ken Fisher of Fisher Asset Management comes from investing royalty. His father, Philip Fisher, wrote the investment classic “Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits” and whom Morningstar called “one of the great investors of all time.” He was a long-term, buy-and-hold investor who, like Warren Buffett, believed the best time to sell a stock was “almost never.” Many of those attributes were passed down to his son, who manages $265 billion in assets under management (AUM). Despite its size, Fisher Asset Management has notched some impressive gains over the past decade. The firm’s 10-year annual returns are north of 58%, while over the last five years, Fisher returned 63%. In just the last 12 months he is up to 24%. Although he has a large portfolio containing well over 900 companies, these are the three stocks dominating this investing icon’s portfolio today. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) recently slipped to fifth place as the most valuable company in Fisher’s portfolio, but its performance so far this year has been stellar. AMZN stock is up 20% year to date and more than 76% higher over the past year.  Because the online retailer is so integral to the economy, it was added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average. It’s not just because of its e-commerce platform but also its cloud services business, which provides the backbone for the internet presence of numerous companies. And it continues to improve itself. Cost-cutting measures and integration of artificial intelligence (AI) are paying benefits to Amazon. Strong revenue and better profit margins over the past few quarters are just some of the tangible results of its efforts. Perhaps most notable is the surge in advertising revenue, up 27% last quarter to $14.7 billion. It is already the third-largest ad platform behind Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). Fisher owns 41.8 million shares of Amazon stock worth $7.6 billion, making it the fourth-largest position in his portfolio at 3.7% of the total. With an average purchase price of around $54 per share, Fisher has seen his investment more than triple in value. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the biggest position Fisher owns. It represents 5% of his portfolio. Few stocks are as closely associated with AI as Microsoft. Having integrated OpenAI’s ChatGPT generative AI technology into all aspects of its operations, the tech giant is receiving significant dividends. AI contributed 600 basis points of growth to Microsoft’s Azure cloud services business last quarter, double what it had done just one quarter prior. It is also helping Microsoft land more and bigger deals for longer contractual periods of time.  Clients like Azure. It allows them to grow their transition to the cloud at their own pace. The hybrid environment lets them choose the level of service they want and where they want it. They can choose between on-premises, in the cloud or a combination of both. Expect to see AI’s growth rate and contribution to Microsoft accelerate in the coming quarters. Fisher owns 25.4 million shares of MSFT stock worth $10.7 billion. He’s generated gains of 291% so far with his average purchase price of $107 per share. The No. two holding in Fisher Asset Management is Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Despite all the headwinds the consumer electronics stock faces, Apple has tripled Fisher’s investment from the average buy-in price of $51 per share. Yet the headwinds are legion. Most notable is the Justice Dept. suing Apple for antitrust violations. Although some of the allegations seem ludicrous, such as operating a monopoly when it has but a 57% share of the domestic smartphone market, it will be a distraction for management as it fights back against the charges. Apple also has its work cut out for it in China, one of its biggest markets but also one that has seen sales slow dramatically. Its iPhone sales reportedly plummeted 33% in China in January and February, according to Bloomberg News. Of course, March tends to be the strongest month of the three in the quarter, so we will need to see how the iPhone fared then.  The consumer tech leader has its next iteration of the smartphone coming out later this year. The iPhone 16 should also have some form of Google’s own AI technology accessible so it could be a big seller. Apple stock is down 9% year-to-date, but no one suggests the party is over by a long shot.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips The future of the U.S. economy looks promising, with recent data suggesting ongoing growth and stability. The stock market, particularly the Nasdaq Composite Index, continues to show impressive gains over the past several months. This underscores confidence in the market’s trajectory. Historical trends indicate that after periods of sustained growth like this, the Nasdaq has often seen further increases, with median performance one year later showing gains of 14.8%. Risks are always to be considered, such as potential declines seen in the past. But overall, the outlook remains positive, buoyed by strong economic fundamentals and robust corporate performance. This Nasdaq bull market is projected to sustain. Let’s delve into the top three Nasdaq stocks that will continue to skyrocket and drive your portfolio value. Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a retail company engaging in the sale of consumer products and advertising. And Amazon Web Services (AWS), which provides cloud computing services, has led to Amazon’s revenue and profit growing over the last few years.  Earnings have been rising consistently as of the last financial year. Furthermore, 51 Yahoo Finance analysts have set an average growth target of 15.7%. AMZN has a profit margin of 5.29% and an operating margin of 7.52%. Clearly, this is impressive given the complex, capital-intensive nature of Amazon’s logistical operations, a key component of its retail services. Coming from a lackluster 2022, quarterly revenue growth year over year (YOY) is 3,721.60%, with EBITDA at $85.52 billion. The Consumer Cyclical sector is projected to grow 36% over the next 5 years. Additionally, AMZN is rated as overweight/outperform by multiple institutions, which hold 62.83% of Amazon. And AWS is encouraging innovation and gaining additional customers by giving startups free credits and allowing these credits to be used on models from companies such as Anthropic and Meta. Finally, an improving foothold in the advertisement sector is also opening up a new front for growth. Therefore, Amazon is likely to continue growing, given the aggressive innovation it pursues and encourages. This stock is a buy! Chinese technology company Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) specializes in internet services, products and artificial intelligence (AI). Currently trading at $108.32, it has a 12-month median price target of $154.34. This represents an increase of 42.49%. In Q4 2023, Baidu reported stellar earnings, showing growth across the board. The company enjoys a revenue increase 6% YOY to $4.92 billion. Net income jumped an astonishing 48% to $366 million, showcasing Baidu’s focus on enhancing operational efficiencies. This success was mirrored in results for fiscal 2023. The company’s goal to persistently improve efficiency and achieve high-quality growth is paying off as net income skyrocketed 169% to $2.86 billion.  Furthermore, this growth will likely continue in 2024. The company was reported to have entered preliminary talks with tech giant Apple to include Baidu’s generative AI in Apple’s devices within China. This collaboration is largely spurred by unique regulatory concerns that the Chinese market presents. China requires that generative AI models must be approved before being launched to the public. And, Baidu’s ERNIE Bot is among those already approved by its cyberspace regulator. Thus, this is providing a huge opportunity for Baidu to grow its AI solutions amid China’s burgeoning AI market. Based on the company’s AI strategy and strong financial position, analysts expect revenue for fiscal 2024 to increase 7.8% to $20.08 billion. Therefore, Baidu’s AI innovation and growth ambitions hold immense long-term gains potential, paving the way for continued future success. Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is one of the largest international technology parent companies. It oversees a broad range of industry giants in social media and communication technologies. Those include Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and more. With the strength of these businesses, Meta is home to a $506.74 valuation with a YOY growth of 137.83%. Also, META reported a strong financial outing in Q4 2023 with sizable growth across the board. Additionally, it outperformed consensus industry forecasts of both EPS and revenue. On the revenue side, META reeled in $40.11 billion, or a growth of 24.7%. Both net income and diluted EPS increase YOY by around 200%, reporting $14.02 billion and $5.3 respectively. In addition, META concluded its 2023 business year on a strong note and hopes to carry similar performance into 2024 on the backs of the AI boom. From 2023-2024, AI has been a key topic for investors. And Meta certainly hasn’t been shy about announcing their new AI developments, including their planned adoption of an AI video ecosystem. These plans, along with recruitments for AI development heads, suggest Meta is on the right track and set for an AI boom of its own.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Today, massive short-squeeze opportunities aren’t as common as they once were. The advent of rapid, high-frequency trading and automated management systems lets short sellers closely track a stock’s movement and jump into action before the conditions for a short squeeze fully materialize. Still, certain heavily shorted stocks present the potential for quick gains as short sellers exit their positions. But high short interest isn’t the best indicator on its own — you have to look at the company’s underlying potential and prospects, unlike, say, hoping for another once-in-a-lifetime short squeeze on a poor performer like Gamestop (NYSE:GME) These three stocks have both traits: decent prospects on their own but unusually high short interest considering their true potential. And that formula sets the perfect conditions for a short squeeze. With a 65% short interest, Imperial Petroleum (NASDAQ:IMPP) is the fourth-most shorted stock this week, notable since many analysts find no substantial flaws with the stock. Imperial operates a relatively small fleet of tankers transporting refined oil. Like many stocks in the sector, Imperial presents a decent small-cap value opportunity beyond its strong short-squeeze potential.  Imperial Petroleum’s earnings report on Feb. 13th, detailing the last quarter and the full fiscal year 2023, demonstrates its strength on both counts. Although Q4 showed modest performance, the year’s financials demonstrated a revenue surge of nearly 90% and net income growth of 141% from 2022. Furthermore, leveraging its substantial cash reserves, the company has continued its $10 million share buyback program throughout the quarter. This strategy is particularly significant given Imperial’s status as one of the most shorted stocks and its slow melt upward over the past month. By buying back shares at these lower prices, IMPP’s management effectively capitalizes on the discount. Coupled with the high short interest, this move significantly heightens the potential for a dramatic short squeeze. Bears are still betting iRobot‘s (NASDAQ:IRBT) failed Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) acquisition spells doom for the robotic vacuum maker. Previously a top merger arbitrage play for 2024, iRobot pivoted to its new status as a prime candidate for a short squeeze with a 35% short interest. Beyond its short-squeeze potential, iRobot stands out as a solid value investment, considering its 0.25x price-to-sales ratio. The company’s sales remain solid to boot, especially considering its higher-end product line and current household budget tightening. The company’s fourth-quarter and end-of-year filings also point to successful executive adaptation to changing conditions. The year’s final quarter highlights include a narrower net loss per share ($2.28) compared to a $3.07 loss during the same period in 2022. That comes, in part, from the rapid right-sizing post-merger collapse that includes an “operational restructuring plan [to] stabilize the business” with plans to “simplify [their] cost structure, create a more sustainable business model, and [focus on] core value drivers.” Ultimately, iRobot is more than a vacuum maker. The company’s range of automation and robotics patents are a major reason Amazon angled for the buyout in the first place. Even if the company can’t set new financial records, it can always fall back on that figurative goldmine.  Desktop Metal (NYSE:DM), a penny stock in the 3D-printing sector, faces substantial short interest (currently sitting around 33%). But the company has a handful of bullish tailwinds gathering behind it that could rapidly trigger an uncontrollable short squeeze, considering its low per-share pricing. First, with shares sitting consistently below $1, there’s little gain to be had from continuing to hold a short position. The risk/reward balance skews heavily toward the risk side of the equation. Expect any significant upward movement to trigger rapid closure. Secondly, Desktop Metal is right-sizing operations, and its recent quarterly report underscores the point. The company’s most recent filing includes a record $65 million in annual recurring revenue — a 29% increase year-over-year. It also enjoyed a substantial reduction in net losses to $323.3 million from a previous $740.3 million. The company’s potential is further underscored by the strategic backing of heavyweights like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Ford (NYSE:F). It indicates a solid vote of confidence in Desktop Metal’s operational and strategic direction. Beyond that backing, Desktop Metal’s healthcare subsidiary (Desktop Health) just launched ScanUp. It’s a subscription-based initiative to bring dental practices into the 21st century by introducing them to digital workflows. Since “half of the dentists in the U.S. have not yet adopted intraoral scanning,” Desktop Health is penetrating a vast and largely untapped market. The platform, bundled into an initial 36-month commitment, promises to secure steady, predictable revenue streams for Desktop Metal, increasing the odds of a short squeeze.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips The crypto market has been going through a sizable correction recently. However, in my view, this cooldown offers a prudent entry point before the next leg higher. As we’ve seen many times during previous bull markets, Bitcoin (BTC-USD) often corrects 15-20% before powering ahead to new highs in the following weeks. I believe we could see something similar play out in the months ahead. Historically, a Bitcoin halving has been preceded by a price correction as Bitcoin consolidates, and it seems we’re going through that now before the halving’s impact catches up. Once the supply crunch from the halving combines with billions flowing into Bitcoin through spot ETFs, we could see crypto lift off to new heights. In the long-run, this could send the rest of the crypto market soaring, especially when the fabled altseason arrives. With that backdrop in mind, let’s explore three cryptocurrencies to consider buying before the Bitcoin halving and pending interest rate cuts take place. Tatsu (TAT-USD) is an emerging player in the crypto sector that provides an exciting concept. The project merges machine learning with decentralization to enable advanced application development. The crypto has recovered significantly recently after going through a correction in late March.  Tatsu is working on creating a world-class open ecosystem for developers to collectively build and profit from the growth we’re seeing in the machine learning space. Tatsu is also closely tied to Bittensor (TAO-USD), a crypto that’s seen immense buzz of late. Bittensor has spiked from $50 to $580 since October. Tatsu could certainly see similar gains, riding the same tailwinds. Moreover, with Tatsu only recently listing on the Mexc exchange, it seems probable further gains lie ahead once the trading frenzy subsides. These price swings make Tatsu one of the most high-risk, high-reward bets among these three picks. But with the right timing, Tatsu could still generate outsized returns over the long-term, for those with the stomach for this volatility. Tectum’s (TET-USD) proprietary Proof-of-Utility consensus mechanism enables this network to achieve unparalleled transaction speeds exceeding 1 million per second – a quantum leap over older blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH-USD). With the capacity to process exponentially more transactions at a lightning pace, Tectum boasts some of the best utility of any layer-1 blockchain. Thus, it ranks highly among my top layer-1 crypto picks. However, I should note that layer-1 cryptos can only deliver astonishing returns if they demonstrate their utility. Other layer-1 startups like DevvE (DEVVE-USD) have lost 50% of their value from their recent peaks due to dilution and failures to feature key things, such as a testnet.  I believe Tectum can be a big winner once the project’s underlying technology is tried and tested. Whether it ultimately succeeds remains unknown. But Tectum’s upside potential is certainly enormous, if this blockchain gains traction. I previously highlighted EGO (EGO-USD) during its pre-sale, and it has climbed nicely since then. However, this token has recently corrected alongside the broader crypto market. Despite the recent pullback, I continue to see sizable upside potential for EGO, as tailwinds align for this project. EGO is the native token of Paysenger, a collaboration platform bringing together creators, fans, and brands. Paysenger utilizes cutting-edge technology and proprietary AI developed by a former Stanford professor. The platform enables paid requests for exclusive content, tips, and expert opinions. Users can also consume subscription-based paid content. Paysenger expands paid creator audiences by letting users to earn EGO tokens for completing tasks. It streamlines collaborations between “idea creators” and content creators. It also introduces personalized AI models that generate art mimicking a creator’s unique style. Paysenger is basically bridging Web 2.0 and Web 3.0. As a result, it is boosting blockchain adoption by attracting many Web 2.0 users. I believe EGO could be a multi-bagger pick, since it only has a market cap of around $4 million at the time of writing.  However, this project has more than 1 million users and is an alumnus of the Consensys accelerator. Passenger also was recognized as a startup program by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and received more than $200,000 in grants from major infrastructure giants. Enough said. Small, low-volume cryptos On Low-Capitalization and Low-Volume Cryptocurrencies: InvestorPlace does not regularly publish commentary about cryptocurrencies that have a market capitalization less than $100 million or trade with volume less than $100,000 each day. That’s because these “penny cryptos” are frequently the playground for scam artists and market manipulators. When we do publish commentary on a low-volume crypto that may be affected by our commentary, we ask that InvestorPlace.com’s writers disclose this fact and warn readers of the risks. Read More: How to Avoid Popular Cryptocurrency Scams On the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips When determining which stocks to invest in, it’s important to decide whether their operating sectors are prosperous and performing well. If very few consumers are eating out, buying shares of a restaurant probably would not be a good idea. I’d recommend doing research on the industries set to dominate the second half of 2024 prior to making your stock picks for the year. In order to ascertain which sectors will outperform in the near-to-medium term, it’s important to consider the impact of strong macro trends. Artificial intelligence and the rapidly growing consumer spending in the U.S. are two of the most dominant macro trends. Despite the recent rise, I believe that we can expect interest rates to come down at least 0.75 percentage points this year. I kept those macro trends in mind when choosing these industries set to dominate the second half of 2024. The use of AI is spreading quite rapidly and widely. Indeed, according to an estimate cited by Forbes, “The global artificial intelligence market…. (will) expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 37.3% from 2023 to 2030.” The sector’s revenues are expected to reach $1.8 trillion by 2030. This will greatly benefit the data center industry. Large amounts of data storage and computing power are required for training and delivering AI. Data centers provide both services.  Unsurprisingly given the rapid growth of AI and data centers’ centrality in enabling AI, data center rental costs have increased rapidly. Last year, the average rental rate jumped 18.6% after the metric rose 14.5% in 2022. With the use of AI still rising by large amounts, the demand for data centers is likely to surge in 2024, causing rent to climb again. Among the data center operators that are likely to benefit tremendously are Digital Realty (NYSE:DLR) and Equinix (NASDAQ:EQIX). The amount spent on computer and storage infrastructure for cloud deployment climbed a robust 18.5% in the fourth quarter of last year. Of course, AI is the major catalyst behind the increase. Higher spending on cloud computing and storage tools is positive for cloud infrastructure providers. This includes Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Salesforce (NYSE:CRM). Of course, the trend of higher spending on cloud services is expected to surge this year as AI proliferates. According to Statista, the global outlays by end users on public cloud services is expected to jump to $678.79 billion this year from $563.59 billion in 2023.  On March 13, Morgan Stanley upgraded its rating on the automotive sector to “attractive” from “in-line.” The bank expects many automakers to benefit from stronger-than-expected demand for gasoline-powered vehicles and reduced capital spending. General Motors’ (NYSE:GM) decision to increase its quarterly dividend to 12 cents from 9 cents is making me more upbeat on the sector is. My optimism is also bolstered by renowned investor David Tepper’s purchase of 265,000 shares of GM stock in Q4 2023. Also noteworthy is that the shares of GM and Toyota (NYSE:TM), the two top-selling automakers in the U.S., have a great deal of momentum already. Specifically, GM stock has risen 25% so far in 2024, while Toyota has lodged a 33% gain so far this year. Automakers should also benefit from lower interest rates in the second half of 2024.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock continues to perform well in 2024. Through its AI investments, shares are now priced at $180, up 20% on the year. Analysts are pricing in a consensus move toward $230 per share, which implies more than 27% upside from current levels. Much of this recent move has been tied to the company’s AI-related endeavors. Amazon recently injected $2.75 billion into AI startup Anthropic, totaling $4 billion, its most significant external investment. Anthropic will reciprocate by spending $4 billion on Amazon’s Cloud over five years. Amazon plans a $150 billion data center investment over ten years, bolstering its cloud dominance. Such substantial commitments suggest a promising 2024 as Amazon accelerates its AI ambitions. Experts have been increasing their earnings estimates for the e-commerce behemoth in March by 0.5% to $4.08. This upgrade reflects strong confidence and optimism from experts, who suggest Amazon’s margins could improve further. As a result of these raised forecasts, the stock climbed a significant 1.2%.  Notably, more than fifteen analysts have changed their estimates positively for AMZN stock over the past two months, with analysts now expecting an additional 41 cents in earnings per share, to $4.08. This upgrade trajectory has been strong, and has transcended earnings predictions. I tend to agree with analysts about Amazon’s earnings potential moving forward. Yes, the company continues to invest heavily into its core business. But the company’s very profitable cloud and AI-related investments should pay off sooner than expected. If they do, these upgrades could turn out to be light. Despite impressive Q1 results, AMZN stock has held steady since the beginning of February. However, with a strong free cash flow outlook, I think this stock is potentially undervalued by more than a third. That is, if current valuation multiples hold, and the company continues to grow its free cash flow at above-market-estimates.  I think that’s possible. The company’s free cash flow of $36.8 billion is astounding, particularly when one considers the company’s total revenue of $574.8 billion. If the company continues to grow free cash flow as expected, and margins improve, this number could easily double in the years to come. For those who use free cash flow metrics to base their valuation of AMZN stock, that’s a good thing. Being the world’s current top cloud provider, Amazon Web Services now holds an impressive 31% of the cloud market. Despite slower sales growth because of inflation, AWS sustained double-digit growth and forged partnerships with key companies like Amgen and Salesforce. AWS expanded its AI services, leading the generative AI movement. Its advertising segment, the company’s fastest-growing division, expanded by 27% in Q4, attracting advertisers with its vast customer base.  Leveraging advanced AI, Amazon optimized ad targeting, enhancing conversion rates in a high-margin business poised for sustained growth. With AI integration across sectors and expansion into healthcare and streaming, Amazon positions itself for future success. Amazon stands as a stalwart in a number of sectors, and is moving past e-commerce and cloud computing into other high-growth markets driven by AI integrations. The company’s status as a blue chip stock isn’t going away anytime soon. If the company can continue to improve its fundamentals, its valuation will follow. I think analysts are spot on with their projections of Amazon’s future performance, and I actually think more upside is possible from current levels.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang is the business equivalent of Caitlin Clark. By that I mean the performance of Nvidia stock in 2024 has made him a legend. His $79.4 billion fortune makes him the 18th richest person in the world. That wealth is up four-fold in a year. Huang’s every public utterance is picked through for lessons in excellence. “I hope suffering happens to you,” he says, and we nod in agreement. “If I had to do it all over again I wouldn’t.” But what does this mean for a small equity investor? Nothing good. When a rumor spread April 1 that Nvidia had bought the Xbox brand from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), reporters began analyzing it before looking at the calendar. Nvidia’s leadership in AI is now taken for granted. Its Blackwell technology guarantees that artificial general intelligence will be here in a few years.  Huang has made thousands of CEOs into techno-optimists, with tricks like talking robots and brute force computing replacing human intuition. The company’s recent Developer Conference quickly became an “AI Woodstock,” filled with demonstrations and claims that aren’t in the market yet. Nvidia stock has had a rough time getting over $900/share in the last month for a reason. Nvidia’s $2.25 trillion valuation is held up by quarterly revenue that tripled in a single year, and profit margins of 72%. Its operating cash flow in 2024 was three times the previous record, and analysts see it doubling again in 2025. But even given all that, its current valuation is outlandish. It trades at 20 times that expected 2025 revenue, and 16 times the expected fiscal 2026 revenue of $136 billion.  Assume for a moment Nvidia stock can hit the $42/share of earnings estimated by the most optimistic analysts for 2026. You’re paying 21 times those earnings to own the stock right now. Logic says it’s time to take something off the table. There are signs in the AI community that the brute force AI approach made possible by Nvidia may be sub-optimal. There are signs that a model with 1 trillion parameters could be analyzed with much less hardware than we once imagined. It turns out bigger isn’t always better. The signs seen by data scientists aren’t yet being seen by AI analysts. But they are being seen by the Cloud Czars who are Nvidia’s biggest customers. Small models may outperform bigger ones. It’s possible to run an AI model on a phone.  Every emerging technology goes through what Gartner (NYSE:IT) calls a hype cycle. Generative AI is now at the peak of expectations. What analysts should be looking for is an event that starts the “trough of disillusionment.” That’s a necessary sell-off before we figure out the true value of AI and start making money from it. I know where the trough hit the original Internet bubble, because I was there. It came on January 10, 2000, when Time Warner “bought” AOL. AOL was so over-valued it owned 55% of the resulting company. At that point Internet asset valuations reached their peak. They proved out in time. Amazon.Com (NASDAQ:AMZN) hit its 1999 price in 2009 and never looked back. Companies like Alphabet (NASDASQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) that understood what their business was prospered.  Nvidia stock will, too. But there’s a hard rain going to fall before that happens. We saw it in 2000, we saw it in 2008, and we saw it in 2022. You don’t want to be in it when the storm hits. I can’t tell you what event might set it off. Maybe Nvidia really will buy the Xbox. That would do it. As of this writing, Dana Blankenhorn had LONG positions in NVDA, MSFT, AMZN, and GOOGL.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips It’s true that even the most successful large banks and billionaire investors make mistakes. Many of them, for example, have piled large amounts of their money into Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), whose shares dropped 12% so far in 2024. So you might not get rich by copying a few picks made by huge banks and billionaires. But, as I’ve pointed out in the past, these investors do have good track records in general. They have access to top-notch research, and they often receive a great deal of information from company insiders. Therefore, you can certainly do worse than emulating the moves made by these investing gurus. With that said, here are three stocks top investors are buying. In the fourth quarter of last year, Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, Norges Bank, acquired 18.1 million shares of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), while JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) added over 7 million shares. Also importantly, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) bought 3.23 million shares of the firm while Fisher Asset Management, owned by multi-billionaire investor Ken Fisher, acquired over 428,000 shares of the name. So AMZN is certainly one of the stocks top investors are buying. Then, in January Canadian bank RBC Capital identified AMZN as a leading pick in the internet space. The bank cited its belief that the firm’s cloud business’ growth will increase this year. Additionally, RBC expects the growth of AMZN’s e-commerce business to enable its EBIT to beat analysts’ average estimate. Finally, RBC is bullish on the firm’s new ad business and its opportunities in the AI space. JPMorgan bought nearly 7.5 million shares of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock in Q4, while Norges Bank added 9.2 million shares of the name. And, multi-billionaire David Tepper added about 2,720 shares, increasing his total ownership of the firm to 1.7 million shares. Moreover, Goldman Sachs bought nearly 3.26 million shares and RBC Capital acquired almost 1.24 million units.  On March 26, investment bank Wedbush Capital reported that, based on its research, it believed that the growth of MSFT’s revenue from its AI tools was increasing. The bank now expects that 70% of MSFT’s users will eventually utilize its AI tools, up from its previous outlook of 60%. The bank expects the company’s revenue from the technology to reach a positive turning point next year. Multibillionaire hedge fund owner David Tepper bought General Motors (NYSE:GM) stock for the first time in Q4, purchasing 265,000 shares of the American automaker.  Moreover, Norges Bank acquired 2.1 million shares, and Goldman Sachs picked up a huge 5.2 million units. Two Sigma Advisers acquired 1.385 million units of GM in Q4. Finally, Citadel Advisors, owned by multi-billionaire Ken Griffin, bought 2.6 million shares of the name in Q4. In December, Japanese bank Mizuho raised its rating on GM stock to “buy” from “neutral.” As reasons for the change, the bank cited reductions in GM’s fixed costs, changes that will boost the profitability of its EV lineup, and a suspension of its investments in its Cruise autonomous unit. Additionally, Mizuho was pleased with the $10 billion of share buybacks which the firm expects to carry out this year. On the date of publication, Larry Ramer held a long position in AMZN.

      "The “Magnificent Seven” is a term coined to describe big tech giants such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), Meta (NASDAQ:META), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). Each of these stocks gained at least 49% in 2023 and have strong competitive advantages. Here, I have shortlisted one Magnificent Seven stock, Alphabet, to see if it is a good buy right now. Overall, I am bullish on Alphabet due to its attractive valuation, the AI megatrend, and its expanding profit margins. Alphabet is the parent company of Google, the largest search engine platform globally. Valued at $1.93 trillion, Alphabet generates a majority of its sales from online ads on its search engine and YouTube, which Google acquired more than a decade ago. Moreover, Alphabet sells applications, digital content, and in-app purchases via the Google Play store. In recent years, Alphabet has entered high-growth segments such as public cloud and artificial intelligence, diversifying its revenue streams in the process. Shares of Alphabet went public in August 2004 and have since returned a monstrous 5,637%. It means a $1,000 investment in GOOGL stock soon after its IPO would be worth close to $60,000 today. In this period, the S&P 500 Index (SPX) returned “just” 600%.  Despite an uncertain macro environment in 2023, Alphabet increased its sales by 9% year-over-year to $307 billion. Its top-line growth accelerated to 13% in the December quarter, surpassing $86 billion. A focus on cost optimization meant the company’s cost of sales rose by only 5% to $23.6 billion, while operating expenses stood at $25 billion, up 11%, allowing the tech giant to report an operating income of $23.7 billion, up 30% compared to the year-ago period, indicating a healthy margin of 27%. A high operating margin translates into free cash flow, which can be deployed to reinvest in organic growth, enhance shareholder wealth, and target accretive acquisitions. In Q4, Alphabet reported free cash flow of $7.9 billion, while the number was much higher at $69 billion in 2023. Similar to other tech heavyweights, Alphabet allocated $62 billion to share buybacks for its Class A and Class C shares last year and ended 2023 with $111 billion in total cash. Alphabet is among the leading players in the artificial intelligence space. In fact, the company is deploying AI capabilities to improve its portfolio of products from Search to ads. In the last year, Alphabet launched AI-powered products such as Bard and Gemini, which should fuel the next generation of advances.  While Gemini has encountered some issues, the platform is engineered to understand and combine text, images, audio, video, and code while running on devices ranging from smartphones to data centers. Alphabet emphasized that it is experimenting with Gemini in Search, making SGE (Search Generative Experience) faster for users. By integrating AI with Search, Alphabet serves a wide range of information requirements. Bard is Alphabet’s conversational AI tool that is powered by Gemini Pro. Available in 40 languages and 230 countries, Bard will remain a key platform for Alphabet, going forward. Alphabet ended 2023 with more than $15 billion in annual subscription revenue, primarily driven by YouTube. Today, YouTube Music and YouTube Premium are available in more than 100 countries, and these platforms enjoy a highly engaged user base. Generally, recurring sales allow a company to generate steady cash flows across market cycles. Alphabet’s increase in subscription sales over the years showcases its ability to deliver high-value offerings to a wide range of users.  Another subscription service offered by Alphabet is Google One, where you pay to store your photos, videos, files, and other data. Google One is experiencing strong user growth and has attracted almost 100 million subscribers to date. Turning to Google Cloud, the business increased sales by 26% year-over-year in Q4 to $9.2 billion. The segment is now reporting consistent profits, ending Q4 with an operating income of $864 million, indicating a margin of 9%. For FY 2023, Google Cloud sales rose 26% to $33 billion, accounting for more than 10% of total revenue. Google Cloud aims to integrate Gemini to widen its base of enterprise customers which should also drive engagement rates higher. Alphabet claimed strong demand for its vertically integrated AI portfolio will create new opportunities for Google Cloud across its product portfolio. Out of the 37 analyst ratings given to GOOGL stock, 29 are Buys, eight are Holds, and none are Sells, indicating a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average GOOGL stock price target is $165.28, indicating upside potential of 6.7% from current levels. Analysts tracking GOOGL stock expect adjusted earnings to expand from $5.80 per share in 2023 to $6.81 per share in 2024 and $7.85 per share in 2025. So, priced at 22.8x forward earnings, Google stock is not too expensive, even though it trades at a higher multiple than peers, as its bottom line is forecast to grow by more than 15% annually in the next two years.  Alphabet is a company firing on all cylinders. Despite its massive size, the tech behemoth continues to grow revenue and earnings at an enviable pace while improving profit margins. Additionally, its investments in AI should equip Alphabet with the resources to gain traction in the highly disruptive market over time. Disclosure\n",
      "(RTTNews) - Amazon Web Services, the cloud computing division of Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), has announced its plans to downsize its workforce. The layoffs specifically target the division's physical stores technology and sales and marketing departments. In a statement, an Amazon Web Services (AWS) spokesperson stated, \"We've identified a few targeted areas of the organization we need to streamline in order to continue focusing our efforts on the key strategic areas that we believe will deliver maximum impact.\" The company said they are committed to supporting affected employees in transitioning to new roles, both within and outside of Amazon. The reduction in staff comes amidst a broader strategic shift within AWS, as the company adjusts its focus in response to market dynamics.  The AWS unit has experienced a slowdown in sales growth recently, attributed in part to companies scaling back their cloud spending amid rising interest rates. The layoffs within AWS' store technology division coincide with Amazon's decision to discontinue cashierless checkout systems in its U.S. Fresh stores. The affected teams oversee various technologies, including the cashierless tech \"Just Walk Out,\" Dash smart carts, and Amazon One palm-based payment system. This move follows a series of layoffs initiated by Amazon in late 2022, amounting to over 27,000 job cuts across various departments. This year alone, layoffs have affected employees in Twitch, Audible, Buy with Prime, Prime Video, and MGM Studios units. Affected U.S. employees will receive pay and benefits for at least 60 days, along with eligibility for severance packages.\n"

      "BofA analyst Justin Post reiterated a Buy rating on Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) with a price target of $204. The Information reported that Amazon will remove its Just Walk Out checkout technology from most of the company’s Fresh locations, citing limitations around the technology in larger format stores. Instead, “version two” of the stores will be outfitted with Dash Carts, smart carts that let customers scan items as they shop and see their spending on a built-in display. Per Amazon’s Senior VP of Grocery Stores, customers have been more receptive to the real-time feedback of Dash Carts through the screen, whereas Just Walk Out could take up to several hours to see a receipt and oﬅen make budget-conscious customers uneasy. According to the Information, budget-conscious customers are uneasy. Per the Information, Just Walk Out is currently installed in 47 of 64 Fresh locations in the US and UK and will still be featured in smaller UK Fresh stores and 22 Go locations.  Post noted the transition from Just Walk Out is part of the broader push to revamp Fresh locations with more customer-friendly features like brighter colors and coffee shops, as opposed to the possibly “Online-first” design of Amazon’s previous locations. Overall, he noted that store changes will continue to evolve in Amazon’s grocery strategy to find what resonates best with consumers before a significant grocery investment cycle. Also, smart carts should allow Amazon to generate incremental advertising revenue from the stores, as per Post. Per the Information, Amazon recently opened an automated facility in Long Island to process Online Fresh orders (with plans to expand to WFM and 3P sellers) and plans to open a 20k sq. ﬅ. fulfillment center in a Whole Foods later in 2024, being part of Amazon’s goal of eventually letting Amazon.com shoppers purchase groceries from multiple banners and receive all items in a single delivery. Once up and running, these automated facilities are being designed to process the delivery volumes that five nearby stores had previously.  Post noted that Amazon is testing an opportunity to make Online grocery delivery more efficient with automated facilities (with the offset being longer delivery distances). Also, building out a limited number of fulfillment centers dedicated to groceries suggests Amazon will be more measured in grocery investments while assessing the opportunity vs. a rapid multi-billion buildout, as per the analyst. Post noted grocery expansion for Amazon as a when, not if, event given the frequency of grocery shopping, the potential for customer lock-in, and scale advantages. He said that Amazon’s grocery strategy and offers continue to evolve (test and learn), such as adjusting the free delivery threshold from $35 baskets to $150 and then down to $100 as the company refined unit economics. With media reports suggesting that Amazon is seeing early success with the new grocery strategy, marked by expanding “version two” stores, investment levels may increase in 2024, Post said.  However, given Amazon’s fourth quarter call comments that retail efficiencies (North America margins ex-advertising) can exceed pre-pandemic levels, he expects grocery expansion to be measured in the near term, which is a favorable strategy for investors in 2024. The re-rating builds on Amazon’s continued expansion of North American retail margins. Price Action: AMZN shares are up 1.12% at $182.71 on the last check Wednesday.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Blue-chip stocks are companies that have been performing at a consistently high levels for a very long time. Most investors consider these to be some of the safest investments you can make. These companies are usually industry leaders that have a long history of growth and stability. Adding a foundation of strong, blue-chip stocks can be a great way to diversify and build your portfolio for the long term. Often, blue-chip stocks can be considered boring and vanilla. Nonetheless, we see certain blue-chip picks as opportunities for excellent growth for shareholders, and in some cases, a generous annual dividend. In this article, we will set our eyes on three undervalued blue-chip stocks to buy into April as the second quarter kicks off. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is an American multinational eCommerce and technology company. As of April 2024, it is the sixth-largest company in the world by market cap and is considered one of the Magnificient 7 stocks. Despite already gaining 20% in 2024, its average one-year price target still gives almost 10% more to grow. After ending March at an all-time high monthly closing price, Amazon is well positioned to climb back to all-time high prices later this year. Like its big tech peers, Amazon is making major bets on the AI industry. This includes everything from integration into its marketplace to improve user experience to leveraging its industry-leading AWS for developers. Amazon has also made multi-billion dollar investments into OpenAI competitor Anthropic which has a ChatGPT rival called Claude AI.  Is Amazon undervalued? Shares currently trade at just 3.2x sales, nearly half of that of Alphabet and a fraction of Microsoft, Tesla, and NVIDIA. With a 5-year revenue CAGR of 20%, Amazon’s price certainly has more room to grow. Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is an American content streaming service that is available by subscription in over 190 countries around the world. This blue-chip stock currently trades at a slight premium to its average analyst price target. For the first time in years, the company has the platform firing on all cylinders. Back in 2022, Netflix started a cheaper subscription price that comes with viewable ads. Last year, Netflix finally cracked down on password sharing. Not only has the platform seen a boost in subscribers, but Netflix has also been able to raise the monthly cost for both basic and premium subscribers. The platform is also adding live sporting events including boxing matches and a new long-term deal with the WWE. Coming back to its valuation, we’ve noticed that Netflix has always traded at a historically higher valuation ratio. Currently, it is trading at about 8x sales and 35x forward earnings. Nonetheless, comparing it to its past four-year price-to-sales ratio and taking into account its healthy 5-year revenue CAGR of 16%, there looks to be plenty of upside for NFLX moving forward. Home Depot (NYSE:HD) is an American home improvement retail brand that was established in 1978 in Marietta, Georgia. Home Depot is a stock that both shareholders and analysts love. In March, Yahoo Finance analysts rated the stock as a Hold or higher, with 21 reiterating Buy or Strong Buy ratings.  The company recently announced an $18.25 billion acquisition for SRS Distribution, which is the largest deal in Home Depot’s history. Home Depot believes this will improve its reach to professional contracts and increase its total addressable market to more than $1 trillion! While the company expects this acquisition to dilute earnings-per-share for fiscal 2024, the long-term benefits of increasing its pro-builder market should outweigh any short-term pain for shareholders. As with most blue-chip stocks, Home Depot trades at relatively safe multiples. The stock is trading at about 2.5x sales and 24x forward earnings. As revenues have plateaued post-pandemic, however, we notice that its P/E ratio has now settled slightly higher than its ten-year historical range. Nonetheless, we see its historically great shareholder returns and 35 consecutive years of strong dividends as reasons to stay bullish on this company into the coming months.

      "Needham analyst Kyle Peterson initiated coverage on Affirm Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:AFRM) with a Hold rating. Affirm is a leading provider of “buy now, pay later” (BNPL) services, with a broad range of product offerings and notable partnerships, most notably with Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Shopify Inc (NYSE:SHOP), the analyst noted. While Peterson flagged Affirm’s diverse product suite and expects the market for BNPL services to generate healthy growth, he rated the stock Hold due to a combination of valuation (~32x his fiscal 2026 EPS estimate), elevated stock-based compensation expense (46% of LTM revenue), and a growing mix share of interest and other lending-related income (~65% of revenue), which he expect to make significant multiple expansion challenging. Also Read: Is Affirm Poised for a Comeback? Analyst Highlights Opportunity in Recent Dip Peterson could become more constructive on the shares in case of a pull-back or if merchant and card network revenue growth becomes a larger piece of the story.  The analyst noted Affirm as a long-term winner in the domestic BNPL space, a large and growing market with a projected 20%+ CAGR over the next 5-10 years based on industry market research reports. In addition, there are notable opportunities for Affirm to scale internationally, especially given the success other BNPL providers, such as Klarna (private), have had in international markets, per the analyst. Peterson noted that Affirm’s technology-related revenue (merchant and card network) should be valued at a higher multiple than its lending-related revenue, given the absence of credit risk and greater capital efficiency. However, he added that much of Affirm’s growth has been due to outsized lending-related revenue (interest income, gain on sale, and servicing) in recent quarters. Lending-related income is ~65% of revenue today, which he noted will cause investors to scrutinize Affirm’s profitability-based valuation metrics increasingly.  Stock-based compensation equaled 46% of Affirm’s revenue in calendar year 2023, which Peterson estimates is the highest among a peer group of digital lending and FinTech companies. While Peterson noted stock-based comp as a cash-efficient way to hire and retain quality employees, he expects this to be a drag on the valuation, especially since the related dilution is likely to be ongoing, with Affirm establishing an annual dilution target of <=5% in the near-term and <=3% over the medium term. This is a long-term headwind for the stock. The analyst expects the headwinds above to keep the shares range-bound over the next 12 months. Affirm stock gained 202% in the last 12 months. Investors can gain exposure to the stock via Tidal ETF Trust II Pinnacle Focused Opportunities ETF (NYSE:FCUS) and Amplify ETF Trust Amplify Online Retail ETF (NYSE:IBUY).

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) stock is on the move Wednesday on reports that the music streaming company is going to increase prices this year. According to these reports, Spotify is looking to bump up prices for its streaming content by $1 to $2 in 2024. The company will allegedly introduce these price increases across five markets including the U.S., U.K., Australia and Pakistan. The reports say that the U.S. price change will go into effect later this year. This will see the price of individual plans increase by $1 per month while family and duo plans will increase by $2 per month. Reports also claim that Spotify is going to introduce a new basic plan. This is said to offer access to music and podcasts on the service but not audiobooks, per Reuters.  If the reports come to fruition and Spotify does increase prices, it will likely be due to the current economy. The cost of goods and services has continued to increase alongside rising inflation.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) layoffs are coming for hundreds of the e-commerce company’s employees as it makes major cuts at its Amazon Web Services (AWS) division. According to an internal email, hundreds of jobs are being eliminated at AWS’ Sales, Marketing and Global Services units. This comes as it shifts away from training operations to “self-serve digital training and training programs run by external partners.” Amazon also notes that its Physical Stores Technology group will also see job cuts. This comes as the company is moving away from its “Just Walk Out” model at its Amazon Fresh grocery stores. A portion of the internal email from AWS Senior Vice President Matt Garman reads as follows, according to GeekWire:  “The changes we are making are preparing the organization for the future, aligning with our strategy and priorities, and reducing duplication and inefficiency. I recognize the effect this has on every individual impacted.” Amazon has been making more efforts to reduce costs with layoffs over the last year. This also comes as it cuts down inflated headcounts after increased hiring during the pandemic. It’s unclear how many more layoffs Amazon will announce.

      "ChargePoint Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:CHPT) shares are trading lower after Goldman Sachs analyst Mark Delaney downgraded the stock to Sell (from Neutral) and cut the price target to $1.50 (from $2.00). The analyst’s bearish stance is due to expected slower growth in the number of EVs on the road in the U.S. and rising competition in EV charging. In particular, Delaney expects the company to be impacted by slower U.S. EV sales as about 80% of its revenue is derived from North America. Also, the analyst sees ChargePoint to face major competition, as Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) recently sold its chargers as a merchant business in select situations, along with ChargePoint’s general shift to multi-sourcing in North America. Read: ChargePoint’s Shifting Fortunes: Analyst Lowers Forecast Citing Slow EV Market And Emerging Cost Reduction Strategies  The analyst says ChargePoint is now partnering with AcBel, which it expects to meaningfully reduce its costs as it ramps up this relationship and works off inventory of existing products. Delaney expects U.S. EV sales growth to slow down considerably versus prior quarters in the first quarter of FY24, based on current market conditions and the finalized EPA emissions standards for 2027-2032. However, if demand for its chargers is stronger than anticipated, the analyst looks to be more positive on the stock. Consequently, the analyst lowered EPS (incl. SBC) estimates to $(0.65) from $(0.60) for FY25, $(0.50) from $(0.35) for FY26, and $(0.35) from $(0.05) for FY27 on lower revenue and margins.

      "Gold prices are projected to jump to $3,000 per ounce by 2025, according to Bank of America, buoyed by strong demand from central banks and the anticipation of investors returning to the market once the Federal Reserve begins to slash interest rates. Michael Widmer, the bank’s commodity strategist, highlighted gold’s resilience as central banks tighten monetary policies. “Gold prices have been remarkably resilient in recent months, notwithstanding central banks around the world tightening monetary policy,” said Widmer. The Chinese central bank, in particular, has played a significant role in supporting the gold market, amassing over $200 tonnes of the yellow metal in 2023 alone. This elevated buying also depends on the heightened activity in China’s retail sector, with jewelry sales and non-monetary gold imports “hitting record highs earlier this year.” “If the Fed ultimately starts cutting rates, investors should return to the market, also offsetting potentially lower Chinese investment demand as sentiment there improves and the economy accelerates. We had previously proposed a US$2,400/oz price estimate if the Fed cut rates in 1Q24; we now raise that and see gold rallying to US$3,000/oz by 2025,” Widmer affirmed.  In response to these developments, Bank of America equity research team has also upgraded its rating on Alamos Gold Corp. (NYSE:AGI) from Neutral to Buy. Chart: Bank of America Predicts A Further 27% Rally In Gold  The optimism extends beyond just precious metals, with Bank of America also sounding the alarm on a potential copper supply crisis. According to Widmer, “raw materials are increasingly dance to their own tune,” and copper is seen at the “epicentre of the energy transition.”  The bank predicts significant increases in copper prices, driven by a variety of factors including green technology investments, thin inventories and global economic recovery. Copper prices are expected to average $10,750 per tonne in 2025, climbing to $12,000 per tonne in 2026. Widmer points out the critical situation in copper mine supply which is beginning to seriously impact refined production. “Tight copper mine supply is increasingly constraining refined production: the much-discussed lack of mine projects is finally starting to bite,” he explained. Although advancements in electric vehicle (EV) technology have reduced the amount of copper required in new models—Tesla Inc‘s (NASDAQ:TSLA) latest 48V system reportedly needs 75% less copper—the demand from other sectors remains high. Notably, copper is crucial for applications such as data center cabling and the electricity network, covering power generation and transmission. Following this optimistic forecast, the bank has also upgraded its ratings for copper producers Freeport–McMoran Inc. (NYSE:FCX) and Hudbay Minerals Inc. (NYSE:HBM) from Neutral to Buy, signaling expected strong performance in the copper sector.

Tesla's Autopilot is an advanced driver assistance system with features intended to make driving safer and less stressful. Tesla and its CEO Elon Musk have always been of the view that its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving technologies are much ahead of competing vehicles. Meanwhile, Huang's family accused that Tesla oversold its Autopilot technology's capabilities, and that it is not as safe to use as advertised.  Following the incident, the National Transportation Safety Board, in its investigation, found that Autopilot was engaged for nearly 19 minutes before the fatal crash. While giving an update about the accident back in 2018, Tesla had stated that the driver had received several visual and one audible hands-on warning earlier in the drive and the driver's hands were not detected on the wheel for six seconds prior to the collision. The company also noted then that the crash was so severe as the crash attenuator, a highway safety barrier which is designed to reduce the impact into a concrete lane divider, had been crushed in a prior accident without being replaced. Tesla has faced many lawsuits in the past years over vehicle crashes connected to its Autopilot technology. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration or NHTSA, the Autopilot system can give drivers a false sense of security, and that it can be easily misused in certain dangerous situations. Following NHTSA's report in December 2023 after a two-year probe into crashes involving Tesla vehicles with driver-assistance technology, the company recalled around 2 million Tesla cars to fix safety issues in its Autopilot advanced driver-assistance system.  The recall reportedly included almost all Tesla vehicles sold in the U.S. since the Autopilot feature was launched in 2015. In January, Tesla also called back over 1.6 million cars in China to fix issues with Autopilot features and door locks. At present, Autopilot features come standard with all new Tesla vehicles. Meanwhile, Tesla has maintained that none of these features make its vehicles fully autonomous or replace the driver. In its site, Tesla notes that Autopilot, Enhanced Autopilot and Full Self-Driving Capability are intended for use with a fully attentive driver, who has their hands on the wheel and is prepared to take over at any moment. The currently enabled features do not make the vehicle autonomous, it says. On the Nasdaq, Tesla shares are currently trading at $176.01, up 1.8%.\n",

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Mega-cap stocks are solid investments overall for several reasons. Recently, they’ve been responsible for the lion’s share of increases in the S&P 500. An investor who focused solely on mega-cap stocks would have outperformed the stock market overall during that period. So,  a high potential for strong returns is one of the best reasons to consider investing in mega-cap companies. The other primary benefit of investing in mega-cap stocks is that they are generally safe. Most of these companies are also blue chip stocks, meaning that they are household names. They tend to have long track records of impressive performance that suggest continued stability. On top of that, they often provide income in the form of dividends. It all suggests stability. Those are two excellent reasons to consider investing. Let’s look at seven mega-cap stocks that have the potential to double your money within three years. AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) has emerged as a key challenger in the race for artificial intelligence (AI) chip dominance. Generally speaking, that is the reason investors are so interested in the stock currently. Most investors are simply reacting to the general strong sentiment surrounding the firm to rationalize their investment. Dig a little bit deeper, and it’s easy to understand why AMD is indeed a strong investment but also one that can triple within the next few years.  The logic for believing that statement can be found in comments made by CEO Lisa Su. Late last year Sue predicted that the market for AI data center chips could reach $400 billion by 2027. Analysts from New Street research noted that even if data center spending only reaches half that target in that time frame, it would correlate to a potential quadrupling of AMD’s price, which was roughly $130 at that time. That would put its price in the low $500s, which is roughly triple its current price. The arithmetic that governs a potential doubling in ASML (NASDAQ:ASML) stock by 2027 is fairly straightforward. Let’s start by running through that quickly. Analysts currently believe that ASML shares could rise approximately 25% in the next year. That Would bring prices to $1,215 in 2025. Let’s imagine that things continue to go well and progress at the same pace for the next two years. That would bring prices just above $1,500 in 2026  and near $1,900 by 2027. That equates to a doubling from its current price. It’s also perfectly logical to believe that that is possible, given the strength of ASML’s products and their relation to current trends. It’s then one of those mega-cap stocks to consider.  ASML is the leading chip tool maker at the leading edge of the technology. the company enjoys a monopoly over extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV). That technology is used to etch patterns on the most complex chip wafers and is indispensable in relation to artificial intelligence. If the AI trend continues as it has, it’s entirely likely that ASML doubles in that timeframe. Adobe’s (NASDAQ:ADBE) stock, like that of so many other companies on this list,  is rising and falling on the potential of artificial intelligence. The emergence of artificial intelligence is the reason to believe Adobe could double from here. Now is arguably an excellent time to stake a position in the stock. Adobe is well known for Photoshop and other graphics tools that position the firm well in the generative AI race. That’s the primary reason that the stock did so well last year. However, Adobe was unable to monetize it to the level investors had expected. The result is that Shares currently trade for $485. That follows a strong pullback that began in February. I’d argue that it’s an overreaction to the overreaction that created the hype in the first place. Adobe did not end up buying Figma which many believed was a bad deal to begin with. That’s positive news. Adobe just has to figure out how to better monetize Firefly. There’s a huge opportunity, given the demand for AI products in content creation. Adobe can easily double from its current price point by 2027. This makes it one of those mega-cap stocks for investors to consider. Many investors are looking for reasons to invest in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)  stock at the moment. there’s a clear contrarian opportunity for those who can find optimism among all the negativity. Shares currently trade for $170. So, it’s easy to see why they have the potential to double in the next few years, given that they traded above $400 just before quantitative tightening set in.  Don’t be fooled, there is plenty of reason for negativity at the moment. Tesla just released its Q1 delivery figures which were disappointing. Elon Musk’s company delivered 386,810 vehicles during the first quarter representing an 8.6% decline year over year. It was the first time since the pandemic began that deliveries fell. Those delivery figures were also far below numbers analysts had been expecting. Beyond that, competition is heating up in the EV sector. Tesla won’t benefit as strongly from its early competitive advantages moving into the future. However, it isn’t all doom and gloom in the near term. Shipping disruptions in the Red Sea were partially to blame for the lower-than-expected delivery numbers. Furthermore, at some point, the Chinese economy will turn around, and demand will rebound. That should propel Tesla higher in the coming year or so. Despite its strong growth, it’s unlikely to surprise many that Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock has the potential to double from here. Let’s assume two things; one, Nvidia continues to enjoy a dominant position in relation to AI for the next few years, two, strong metrics continue to hold over that period. Under that scenario Nvidia can double by 2027.  Nvidia’s sales are expected to be somewhere in the neighborhood of $102 billion dollars in 2025, per consensus estimates. Some Wall Street analysts believe that revenues could reach $300 billion by 2027 on AI chip sales alone. Nvidia shares would easily double under that scenario and, more realistically, would triple in value, assuming valuations hold steady. Growing from $102 billion in sales in 2025 to $300 billion by 2027 makes that potential very obvious. More likely, though, metrics like the P/E ratio would rise even higher if Nvidia sales grow that quickly. Thus, share prices would more than triple if sales grow to that height by 2027. Could Toyota (NYSE:TM) stock eventually emerge as the biggest winner in the EV revolution?  The answer is a resounding: “Yes!” Toyota has been building ultra-reliable, somewhat uninspiring vehicles for many decades. The company’s nature is to default to data suggestive of reliability in guiding its decision processes. It’s highly likely that Toyota knew that a pure EV strategy was not the way forward based on such data. That got Toyota in trouble relative to other big automobile manufacturers that adopted the EV craze to their detriment. Just look at what has happened to Ford (NYSE:F) and GM (NYSE:GM). Their decision to invest heavily in pure EV technology hasn’t paid off. Toyota believes that a hybrid first strategy is The logical path toward EV profits.  As the EV hype has died down, Toyota suddenly looks brilliant. The point here is not for Toyota to say I told you so but rather that the company’s slower, iterative approach will win in the end. That’s why I believe the company will ultimately emerge as one of the big winners in the EV race over time. Toyota is likely to find profitability from EVs without sinking unnecessary billions of dollars into the technology in an effort to skip the necessary steps. It’s no secret that many investors are betting on Alibaba (NASDAQ:BABA) stock to double in the next few years. Share prices have fallen by more than 75% since late 2020. During that period, Alibaba has gone from a presumed competitor with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to something much less flattering. In any case, it’s very easy to find a narrative in which Alibaba doubles in the next few years. Let’s do some simple arithmetic that proves the possibility is entirely real. Alibaba’s price/sales ratio over the last 10 years has a median of 8.34. However, it currently stands at 1.43. It doesn’t seem likely that it’ll rise to the median anytime soon: the Chinese economy continues to experience difficulty. Alibaba’s shares are unlikely to pop for that reason. However, imagine that the P/S ratio doubles. That would correlate to a doubling of price and more, given that sales are predicted to continue growing, albeit at a slower pace. If the Chinese economy rebounds over the next few years, it’s all entirely possible. This makes it one of those mega-cap stocks to buy.

      "The Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) rally has paused and the stock is poised to open slightly higher after the nearly 5% rally on Monday. A duo of analysts on Monday questioned the very premise on which the stock advanced. Unexciting: Tesla investors will not get excited about the August 8 robotaxi unveil, said Future Fund Managing Partner Gary Black. This lack of interest would persist until the company can give assurance that its full-self-driving software will be 99.99% intervention-free and that it is prepared to assume liability for injury or damages to appease regulators, he said. Our view on $TSLA is that investors will not get excited about the 8/8 robotaxi unveil until TSLA can provide assurance FSD will be 99.99% intervention free, and that TSLA is prepared to assume liability for injury or damages to appease regulators tasked with granting robotaxi… pic.twitter.com/RT2LhnLKRV Black said he expects the Elon Musk-led company to guide 2024 delivery growth down to near zero on its first-quarter earnings call. Currently, the expectations are for 9% year-over-year growth to 1.963 million units, he noted. The fund manager expects the Street to reduce its 2024 adjusted earnings per share estimate from $2.85. If Tesla signals that the $25K compact car may be delayed past 2026, the 2030 consensus estimates of a 17% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) in volume and 22% CAGR  in earnings per share will be reduced further, Black said. This could pressure Tesla’s 2024 price-earnings multiple, which has been relatively stable around 57 times over the past 12 months, he added.  See Also: Everything You Need To Know About Tesla Stock Aspirational Move: Musk’s announcement of the August 8 robotaxi unveiling is more “aspirational,” similar to the Tesla Semi and Roadster announcements, said Tesla bear and Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi, excerpts of the note shared on X showed. BERNSTEIN: \"..  We see a Robotaxi unveiling on August 8 as more aspirational, akin to $TSLA Semi and Roadster announcements – and not likely to be Tesla's next model .. We only expect competitors' offerings to get better over the next three years – BYD currently offers a $15K… pic.twitter.com/me0IpZwwO5 Tesla Roadster, a four-seater all-electric sports car, which is seen as the successor to the 2008 production model Roadster, is a long time coming. It was first teased in 2014 and is yet to see the light of the day.  The Tesla Semi, a heavy-duty electric semi-truck, which was first mentioned in Tesla’s 2016 Master Plan, began deliveries only in late 2022. The analyst also warned of competitive threats. “We only expect competitors' offerings to get better over the next three years,” he said, adding that Chinese startup BYD currently offered a $15K sedan – the Qin Plus, that has a 250-mile range and is bigger than the Model 3.  Bernstein has an Underperform rating and a $120 price target for Tesla shares. In premarket trading on Tuesday, Tesla rose 0.46% at $173.78, according to Benzinga Pro data.

      "Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares surged on Monday, propelling the electric vehicle maker back to the top holding in Cathie Wood‘s flagship  Ark Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKK). This shift was also aided by Ark’s ongoing sell-off of Coinbase Global (NASDAQ:COIN) shares, which previously held the leading position. Tesla Now Holds The Lead: As of Tuesday, ARKK’s holdings in Tesla totaled $714.36 million, according to the firm’s website. Notably, Ark did not trade Tesla shares on Monday itself. Coinbase, now in second place, represents $714.63 million of the fund’s value. Weighting and Share Count: Interestingly, both Tesla and Coinbase hold a weighting of 9.75% in ARKK. However, Tesla’s higher share count (4,129,696 vs. 2,780,772 for Coinbase) likely explains its top position. See Also: Best ETFs To Buy Right Now Why It Matters: Ark remains bullish on Tesla. The firm holds a $2,000 price target for the stock, largely based on the potential of its robotaxi business. Ark supported the stock throughout 2022’s weakness, even when Elon Musk sold Tesla shares to fund his acquisition of Twitter.  Ark’s Recent Tesla Strategy: While Tesla rebounded strongly in the first half of 2023 due to price cuts, Ark took profits. They continued selling even as the stock price suffered in the second half when the cuts failed to significantly increase sales. As the weakness intensified in 2024, Ark has propped up the stock on days it experienced acute weakness. On Friday, when the stock slumped on rumors of canceling its low-end EV, Ark bought over $22 million worth of stock. Tesla In Other Ark ETFs: Tesla remains present in Ark’s other ETFs. Their 13F filing with the SEC in January showed they held 3,802,519 Tesla shares at the end of Q4, valued at $944.85 million. Shifting Tides: Tesla lost its top spot in ARKK to Coinbase in January 2022, according to Seeking Alpha. Ark has been selling Coinbase since July 2023, a trend that continued with the launch of their spot Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) ETF, the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (CBOE: ARKB). Premarket Movement: In premarket trading on Tuesday, ARKK dipped slightly by 0.08% to $48.06, according to Benzinga Pro data.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips From a bird’s-eye view, it’s tempting to dismiss automotive giant General Motors (NYSE:GM) stock as an anachronistic enterprise. Yes, the legacy automaker has made a strong pivot to electric vehicles. However, sector leader Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has long held a vice grip on the ecosystem, making a competitive charge difficult. Nevertheless, circumstances are falling favorably for GM stock, making it a worthwhile investment. First, GM stock itself appears significantly undervalued compared to the rest of the auto industry. Second, the market appears to overstate Tesla’s viability ahead of serious challenges for the EV pioneer. Therefore, GM stock is quietly flying under the radar, making it an attractive idea for forward-thinking speculators. As a result, I am bullish on General Motors. Primarily, GM stock stands to benefit from an exciting product portfolio. Yes, excitement is a subjective term. However, the concept is backed by objective data. For example, U.S. drivers spend on average 17,600 minutes driving each year. Over a lifespan, that could translate to 4.3 years of one’s life. That’s a long time sitting on a set of wheels. With that in mind, buying a new (or new-to-them) car represents an investment of sorts for many drivers. Of course, most vehicles represent depreciating assets. However, because you’re spending so much time in a car, you want the best experience that you can comfortably afford. With a company like General Motors, it offers myriad options.  If you want an affordable SUV that can carry groceries and the kids, GM has your back with the Chevy Equinox or the Blazer. Should you prefer something more upscale, the company gives you the Cadillac brand. And if you want to experience the thrill of premiere automotive performance, you have the mid-engine Corvette, America’s supercar. Best of all, General Motors has invested heavily in EVs, forwarding innovations such as its Ultium battery. Whatever the customer wants – and more specifically, whatever fits the customer’s budget – GM has it. That’s a huge advantage over pure-play EV manufacturers, which have resorted to price wars to boost sagging demand. Thus, it’s probably no coincidence that GM stock is up almost 23% year-to-date while TSLA is down almost 34%. Another factor that could benefit GM stock is that combustion-based technologies – whether pure play or hybrid – may see a longer relevancy pathway than previously expected. That’s because EVs are still more expensive in terms of upfront costs than their combustion-powered counterparts. And because of economic concerns, Tesla may lose significant sheen off its social cachet. Let’s face reality – EVs are boring. Whenever one pulls up next to me, I don’t notice it audibly and that’s the point. However, it also means that at the core, there’s very little difference between a Tesla and any other EV, especially a Chinese-made EV. Should economic pressures such as inflation and high borrowing costs remain elevated, then over time, people transitioning to electric mobility will likely eschew brand image for price. Without getting into pejoratives, an electric motor is an electric motor. It’s not like the difference between an inline-four-cylinder engine versus a V10. That’s a massive contrast that’s immediately recognizable.  So, with very little separating the heart of a Tesla versus a competing EV, both Tesla and pretty much any western pure-play EV company faces a severe long-term threat from China. It really just comes down to the math. When you factor in holistic costs – especially labor – Chinese manufacturers can produce more for less than their American counterparts. Over the past several decades, manufacturing jobs didn’t move to China because we love the country so much. No, it just makes financial sense to do so. If that wasn’t the case, the jobs would never leave. Right now, GM stock trades for 4.91X forward earnings and 0.35X trailing-year revenue. As you might imagine, both of these stats rank lower than their sector median stats. Now, some might argue that this favorable dynamic has materialized because the forward projections are modest. Analysts anticipate earnings per share for the current fiscal year to reach $8.99 on sales of $175.85 billion. Last year, EPS was $7.68 on revenue of $171.84 billion. In other words, GM stock could be richly profitable but only benefit from a modest 2.3% growth rate. And fiscal 2025’s sales projection of $178.41 billion implies only 1.5% growth. However, these stats could be understated.  Again, General Motors offers a diverse and exciting product portfolio that fits practically every budget. It’s also ready to pivot more aggressively to EVs should market demand dictate it. And should China take over the EV space, there’s still a chance that GM could carve out a viable niche. It’s a well-recognized and trusted brand. Further, its rich portfolio facilitates flexibility, which is crucial during these times. Therefore, GM stock appears an underappreciated buy.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Electric Vehicle (EV) maker Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) stock is being hailed as “the new Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).” The idea is it has cool cars, it has a clear path toward scaling and profits, and it doesn’t have a crazy CEO. Instead, it has R.J. Scaringe, a 41-year old Florida native and the son of an engineer. But as a stock, the new Tesla is not much different from the old one. Shares are down 57% this year, the market cap below $10 billion. The problem isn’t supply, but demand. I got to see a Rivian R1T truck in Atlanta recently. It’s impressive and, unlike the Tesla Cybertruck, it looks familiar. That is, until you look inside. Then it becomes very simple indeed. Open the hood and you don’t see an engine, just a front-end trunk.  All EVs are simple machines. A low-level platform holds the batteries that power it, the motor is just a rotor spinning inside an electromagnet.. The transmission is simple, supporting just 1-2 gears. All the moving parts of the EV rest at the platform level, so the top can be anything you want. (The platform is usually called a skateboard.) The R1T looks like a truck because people are accustomed to trucks. Change the body and it’s a Sports Utility Vehicle (SUV), the R1S. Change it again and it’s a delivery van, which may be more important. Rivian’s main task now is downsizing the platform. A smaller R2 platform will lead to cars costing just $45,000. Rivian believes the even-smaller R3 platform will deliver cars at $35,000. This is what most excited people at its recent press conference. The passenger car version of the R3 is a “crossover,” like my Toyota (NYSE:TM) Scion XB of blessed memory. Reviewers are excited. Rivian’s challenge is getting from the R1 to the R3.  Despite a lot of hype, RIVN stock made fewer than 14,000 vehicles in the last quarter. The production target for 2024 is just 57,000. It’s a tiny fraction of the 387,000 Tesla made, a result that tanked the stock and overwhelmed demand. Rivian lost $5.4 billion last year, ending the year with $7.8 billion in cash. It lost $4.86 billion of cash on operations, raising $3.13 billion, mainly convertible notes. You can see why RIVN stock put off development of its Georgia plant, preferring to continue operations in Normal, Illinois, where it has 8,000 employees. It doesn’t have the money. Key to getting the cash will be re-tooling the Normal plant for the R2 this summer. The hope is this will result in a gross profit on the cars by the fourth quarter. Half the savings would come from unspecified “design changes, supplier negotiations, and lower raw material costs.”  A gross profit should raise the stock price, and make stock easier to sell. Tesla now sells at 5 times sales, Rivian at 2 times, because Tesla makes money at scale and Rivian does not. It’s going to be tight. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has only gotten 10,000 of the 100,000 delivery vans it ordered five years ago. That, and stock purchases from Amazon and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) (Ford has since sold out), put Rivian on the map. Exclusivity on the vans ended late last year, prompting a big order from AT&T (NYSE:T). To get to 2025, Rivian must make money on the vans. The van’s design illustrates the hope I still have in the EV market. It’s built on the same skateboard platform as the R1T. As battery costs decline, this simple design will overpower complex ICE machines and change the world.  Whether Rivian will be part of that world will be answered in 2024. If it is, you’re speculating near the lows. If the numbers let it commit to Georgia, then you buy with both hands. As of this writing, Dana Blankenhorn had a LONG position in AMZN.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Lucid stock (NASDAQ:LCID) burst into the scene with its sleek, high performance luxury electric vehicles (EVs). The company’s initial promise and bold claims after its IPO in 2021 garnered significant investor attention. However, 2024 could be the year that the music stops for Lucid stock. Plagued by questionable leadership decisions, dwindling cash reserves, and an intensifying competitive landscape, a reality check is overdue. Investors who were initially drawn to the company may be wise to reevaluate their holdings. Mounting evidence suggests that Lucid is facing significant headwinds that could make a turnaround increasingly difficult. Lucid’s leadership has displayed a pattern of questionable decision-making, hindering the company’s progress. CEO Peter Rawlinson, while visionary, has repeatedly set ambitious production targets that have consistently missed. This overpromising and under delivering pattern has eroded shareholder confidence and cast a shadow over the company’s operational efficiency. In fact, I am even more skeptical about management’s understanding of the global EV market which has changed dramatically in the last 12-18 months.  Demand for EVs has decelerated and the biggest players such as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDY) are decreasing prices. I think they are underestimating the true demand for luxury EVs as well as macroeconomic headwinds that could affect production and deliveries over the next several quarters. Furthermore, Lucid stock has experienced high executive turnover. This revolving door of leadership raises red flags about the company’s stability and strategic direction. Lucid’s hunger for capital is no secret at this point. The company has been burning through cash at an alarming rate to fund its expansion plans. It has gotten to a point where it’s not if but when the company will raise more capital and dilute shareholders. Their access to capital and number of high profile investors has been the company’s kryptonite. They have essentially become a spoiled child that won’t be able to recover due to their unique privileges and advantages. In order to keep operations running, Lucid stock may have no choice but to resort to further equity raises diluting existing shareholders.  Furthermore, the competition is heating up and while their market is segmented, management may be overestimating demand. Even if LCID is able to meet production targets in 2024, their deliveries will be far less than what the market anticipates. Investors must also keep in mind that the car business is one of the most competitive and complex businesses in the world. Very few will survive and I don’t see LCID as one of them. Lucid stock is at a crossroads and while its vehicles boast impressive technology and design, the harsh reality of the EV market is unforgiving. The combination of questionable leadership, a future cash crunch, and a highly competitive landscape casts a shadow on their long term growth prospects. Investors betting on a Lucid turnaround are taking a considerable degree of risk. There’s a growing possibility that the company may struggle to achieve the scale and efficiency needed to drive profitable growth. If you decide to jump back in, do so with extreme caution, and be willing to lose the remainder of your investment.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips There are seven EV stocks for investors to consider adding to their portfolios this month in April. I think that this year will be a great time for investors to jump in the market, as it  has been rapidly growing, driven by increasing consumer demand, advancements in battery technology. Overall, I see that China will become a major player in the EV space, so investors should position their portfolios accordingly. This is because the country has been making a strategic shift from traditional industries like real estate towards high-value, technology-driven sectors, including electric vehicles. Due to the credit crisis in the country, namely due to an unsustainable real estate industry that has historically fueled part of its GDP, China’s leadership is now eying growing its economy and workforce into a productive powerhouse. Selling Chinese cars to Chinese consumers is part of leadership’s goal, with excess production being shipped overseas. So with this thesis in mind, here are seven EV stocks for consumers to consider, which rides on China’s growth strategy.  Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI) specializes in electric vehicles equipped with range extenders, mitigating range anxiety for customers. In November 2023, LI delivered a record 41,030 units, as Investorplace.com reported, highlighting a 2.7 times increase from the previous year. This surge in deliveries, reaching 325,677 units for the cumulative year. It saw robust demand. for its premium SUVs such as the Li L9, Li L7, and Li L8. These models combine gasoline generators with batteries to extend their range. Looking forward to 2024, LI plans to maintain its significant presence in the EV market by launching three all-electric models based on a high-voltage platform in the second half of the year. Additionally, the early launch of the Li L6, a five-seat EREV SUV, originally scheduled for June, has been moved up to this month to compete directly with offerings from other manufacturers. LI has set an ambitious sales target of 800,000 units for 2024, aiming for the Li L6 to achieve monthly sales of 30,000 units. BYD Company (OTCMKTS:BYDDY) operates across electric cars, electronics, and energy industries.  I’m the most bullish on BYDDY out of all of these companies on this list. The reason being is that there is a high amount of Chinese consumption for BYDDY’s line of vehicles, with 90 percent being sold domestically in China. However, there’s more to the story. In 2023, BYD achieved significant growth, concluding the year with a record 3 million annual sales and becoming the global leader in new energy vehicle (NEV) sales for the second consecutive year. This achievement also marked BYD’s entry among the global top 10 car sales for the first time. BYD’s product range, including the Dynasty and Ocean series, DENZA, FANGCHENGBAO, and YANGWANG, contributed to a 61.9% surge in sales compared to the previous year. BYDDY is helping to lower the average of cost EV’s across the board with its mid-market offerings, which positions it uniquely in the market against competitors like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), especially in markets outside the U.S. where BYD has a significant presence​. Nio (NYSE:NIO) produces premium electric cars and is known for technologies such as autonomous driving and battery swapping. NIO is still a buy for me, despite revising its guidance for delivery numbers downwards this year.  For 2024, NIO aims for sales forecasts exceeding 230,000 units. The introduction of the Alps model, based on the NT 3.0 platform, is anticipated in the second half of 2024. While BYDDY may cater to the mid-market, NIO competes more closely within Tesla’s waters in the luxury and high-end segment. However, as in the case with the majority of the Chinese EV stocks on this list, NIO will compete mostly with other Chinese companies and within the East Asia geographical area in general. Still, NIO’s progress is built on a solid foundation. In 2023, NIO achieved a significant growth milestone, delivering 160,038 vehicles, marking a 30.7% year-over-year increase. This performance contributed to a cumulative delivery of 449,594 vehicles by the end of December 2023. XPeng (NYSE:XPEV) offers smart electric vehicles and has gained attention for its advanced EVs. I like XPEV because it plans to invest significantly in artificial intelligence (AI) for intelligent driving and aims to launch around 30 new or revised products over the next three years. XPEV is establishing itself firmly in the domain of “smart EVs” for Chinese consumers, and some of its models have attracted attention from investors and car enthusiasts overseas as well.  I also think that XPEV stock is a somewhat underappreciated name for investors interested in Chinese EVs. The company has launched the X9 Ultra Smart Large Seven-Seater in China, which has many auto magazines and podcasts excited. Financially, XPeng is working towards achieving breakeven by 2026, indicating a focus on improving profitability in the coming years. Analysts have a mixed outlook on XPeng, with a recent price target set by Morgan Stanley at $18, suggesting a substantial upside from its current closing price. Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN), an American electric vehicle automaker, is the first non-Chinese stock on this list that I feel has great potential for investors. I chose RIVN because it reported its Q1 2024 production and delivery totals, indicating that it produced 13,980 vehicles and delivered 13,588 during the period. This performance was consistent with the company’s expectations. Looking ahead, RIVN has reaffirmed its 2024 guidance, planning to produce a total of 57,000 vehicles for the year. Additionally, RIVN has projected an adjusted EBITDA loss of $2.7 billion for 2024 and announced plans to reduce its salaried workforce by approximately 10% to further improve cost efficiency.  It may sound strange, but I love it when a company chooses to trim the fat off their operations, which often comes in the form of layoffs. A smaller business is generally more internally efficient, and the reduced headcount means there’s less salaries to pay and stock-based compensation to dilute shareholders. Trading at just 2.3 times sales, RIVN is one of those EV stocks for investors to consider if they want to stick with American made. Lucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID) produces luxury electric vehicles and operates North America’s first purpose-built, greenfield EV factory. LCID is my contrarian pick of these EV stocks to buy. The risks of investing in LCID is substantial, but the counterfactual is that the brand’s valuation is very cheap in my view. LCID plans to manufacture only 9,000 electric vehicles (EVs) in 2024, a stark reduction from its earlier forecast of 90,000 EVs. Framing the company’s issues is this: In 2023, LCID faced a $2.8 billion loss, prompting a price reduction of its Air sedan by $8,000 in an effort to boost sales. However, the introduction of the Gravity SUV, slated for production in late 2024, could be a catalyst for growth that the company desperately needs.  Not all the news is bad though. In 2023, LCID delivered 6,001 vehicles, marking a 37% increase compared to 2022. Its production figures for the same year stood at 8,428 vehicles. The stock is also down 73.61% over the past five years, so there’s plenty of room for a potential recovery. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is, and perhaps always will be one of my top EV stocks. It’s largely a barometer for the entire industry, especially for investors and consumers who prefer premium, American-made vehicles. The company has planned to increase its capital expenditure to over $10 billion for the year. This investment is aimed at bridging the gap between its first major growth wave, marked by the ramp-up of Model 3 and Model Y production, and the next anticipated growth wave, expected to begin with the ramp-up of next-generation vehicles in late 2025. However, Tesla’s Q1 2024 performance indicated challenges with an 8.5% year-over-year decline in vehicle deliveries, attributed to production ramp-up phases and unexpected factory shutdowns. This decline represents Tesla’s first such decrease since the second quarter of 2020​. The silver lining though is that I believe that TSLA is undergoing a contractive phase before springing back to life, like momentum stored in a coiled spring. Its valuation has also improved, with its stock price near a one-year low, and its issues I believe are cyclical rather than structural, which could mean it’s a great opportunity for investors to hop on board TSLA now.

      "Reports of electric vehicle company Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) abandoning plans for a $25,000 vehicle were one of the key headlines last week. An analyst breaks down what the reported decision could mean and how the company's robotaxi strategy could be more important. The Tesla Analyst: Deutsche Bank analyst Emmanuel Rosner has a Buy rating on Tesla and lowers the price target from $200 to $189. Related Link: Gene Munster Backs Tesla’s Focus On Robotaxis Over Low-Cost EV, Gary Black Skeptical Of Strategy: ‘Institutions Would Dump The Stock’ The Analyst Takeaways: The news that could see Tesla abandoning its $25,000 vehicle could be \"thesis-changing\" for the electric vehicle company, Rosner said.  The analyst questions if the news is bullish or bearish. \"With still many questions unanswered, it may be too early to tell if it is particularly bearish, or potentially positive,\" Rosner said. A Reuters report said Tesla was scrapping plans for a $25,000 consumer electric vehicle that was planned for 2025. Instead, the report said Tesla will put its focus on the highly anticipated robotaxi. Shares of Tesla fell on the report. Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the Reuters article was full of lies, but failed to clarify what the real story was. Musk also tweeted that the Robotaxi will be unveiled on August 8, which prompted more questions. \"As of now, it is unclear if a drivable version of Model 2 is still coming and if so when; how far along is robotaxi in its development and what a realistic timeline for deployment is in light of considerable technology and regulatory hurdles ahead.\"  Tesla will report first quarter financial results on April 23, which Rosner said could be a chance for the company to provide some comments on these items above. \"We view it as plausible that Tesla put its Model 2 efforts on [the] back burner in light of issues ramping up its 4680 battery capacity at the right cost, and growing competition from Chinese OEMs at even lower price points.\" The analyst said a reversed course to focus on robotaxis and step away from the Model 2 could \"command more favorable economics\" for Tesla. \"This would avoid going down the rabbit hole of bruising global competition for the cheapest EV, and position Tesla as an AI play, rather than a volume automotive OEM.\" Rosner cautioned that some shareholders might own Tesla stock for the Model 2 potential and shares could see increased pressure if the Model 2 is being put on hold.  \"Model 2 indeed has been Tesla's nearest-term opportunity to reaccelerate volume, margins and FCF, after years of declining earnings and limited volume growth due to an aging vehicle lineup and growing global EV competition.\" The analyst said that some downside risk for Tesla could already be priced in, but earnings estimates for 2026 and beyond would likely be revised down if the Model 2 is not launching on its previous timeline. \"We would also worry about the catalyst path from here, post Aug 8, as any production and rollout of Robotaxi could still be years away.\" The analyst said an acceleration of Robotaxi alongside the existing timeline for Model 2 would be a positive signal, while the Model 2 being pushed back or canceled could significantly alter the outlook for Tesla. TSLA Price Action: Tesla shares were up 5% to $172.98 on Monday versus a 52-week trading range of $152.37 to $299.29.

      "(RTTNews) - In 2018, Wei \"Walter\" Huang, a former Apple engineer, died in a car accident while driving his Tesla Model X on Autopilot. Huang's family has filed a lawsuit against Tesla for wrongful death, alleging that the company promoted Autopilot as a self-driving software falsely, and failed to provide essential safety features like a proper crash avoidance system and automatic emergency braking, which could have prevented the collision. Tesla has argued that Huang's inattention and misuse of Autopilot were the primary causes of the crash, claiming that Huang did not have his hands on the steering wheel for six seconds before the accident, and was playing a video game on his phone while Autopilot was engaged. Huang's family alleges that Tesla and Apple are working together to support Tesla's defense in the lawsuit. Tesla is seeking Apple's assistance to demonstrate that Huang was using his iPhone to play a video game when he crashed while Autopilot was engaged. Despite the National Transportation Safety Board's inconclusive investigation into the incident involving Huang, the family's legal team suspects Apple of covertly aiding Tesla in placing blame on Huang for distracted driving. The family's attorneys claim that Apple is collaborating secretly with Tesla, as supported by a statement from an Apple engineering manager indicating user interaction on Huang's phone before the crash.  Apple has declined to share confidential information, while the National Transportation Safety Board has only reported that Autopilot was active for nearly 19 minutes before the crash, during which the vehicle veered off the highway at a speed of 71 mph. Over the past six years since the accident, Tesla has faced significant scrutiny for its Autopilot technology. In December 2023, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration concluded a two-year investigation of 1,000 Tesla crashes involving Autopilot, stating that the system could mislead drivers into a false sense of security and might be misused in hazardous situations where they cannot safely navigate the road.\n",
      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips The stock market seems to win even when it loses. Even as a strong jobs market report Friday hints that interest rate cuts are not coming in the next few months, both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 gained several hundred points or about 1%. After last year’s big comeback, many expected growth stocks to not power the indices higher again. But history shows stocks often have back-to-back strong performances after a down year. That’s likely because bull markets tend to run for several years while bear markets usually last for less than 18 months. Also, that accounts for Wall Street’s bullish outlooks on most stocks. Only a relative handful of stocks are ever rated a sell. Analysts have an especially rosy outlook for the three companies below. They believe the stocks can run between 123% higher or more. Let’s see whether Wall Street found a few growth stocks that are really hidden gems to buy. Hope springs eternal for movie theater operator AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC), which got decimated by the pandemic and has yet to recover. Its stock is doing even worse, losing 95% over its value from the 52-week high it hit last July. Analysts, though, still see the stock rising 137% in value over the coming year. Never mind the consensus sell rating on AMC stock. Even on the low side of estimates, there is hope for a 57% gain. What’s going on here?  B. Riley Securities analyst Eric Wold has steadily lowered his price target on AMC Entertainment. It went from a high of $45 per share last September down to $8 a stub in March. All the while Wold remains neutral on its shares with a hold rating. TheStreet.com points out Wold highlighted AMC’s better-than-expected earnings report due to distributing concert films from Taylor Swift and Beyonce. It suggests an avenue the theater owner can take in the future to boost revenue along with strong concession stand sales. Yet, delays in several anticipated movies this year were behind Wold’s decision to cut his target price from $12 to $8 per share. This is just wishful thinking. Theater attendance remains below pre-pandemic levels. Hollywood is not churning out many blockbuster films these days. The age of the super hero flick seems over and with more entertainment alternatives available, theaters will not recover the ground they lost. Wall Street might think AMC Entertainment stock can double or more from here. But investors would be better off avoiding it and looking elsewhere for opportunity. Wall Street also has high hopes for robotaxi stock Archer Aviation (NYSE:ACHR). Shares are down 30% in 2024 but over the past year they are up almost 60%. Analysts see the electrical vertical takeoff & landing (eVTOL) leader more than doubling in value. The median price target is $9.60 per share, or 123% of its current $4.30 price tag. Unlike AMC, Wall Street has a strong buy rating on the company. There is good reason to be ebullient about Archer Aviation stock’s potential. The eVTOL industry is being developed literally from the ground up. Archer and rivals like Joby Aviation (NYSE:JOBY) and Lilium (NASDAQ:LILM) are creating something from nothing and are almost ready to launch commercial businesses.  Normally, investing in such a situation would be high risk but the eVTOL industry really is on the brink of reality. Although ACHR is risky, the company benefits from support not only from airline and automotive industries but also the federal government. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has been surprisingly supportive and accommodating to Archer, Joby and others. There is even cooperation from NASA and the Air Force. Archer has an order book for 700 aircraft once it receives FAA approval. And, the United Arab Emirates will permit it to immediately launch a robotaxi service when the FAA says “go.” Wall Street might not have liked Archer’s recent earnings report, but it’s right in line with development-stage companies. Archer Aviation stock could be one the analysts are underselling. Wall Street sees Chinese electric vehicle (EV) company Xpeng (NYSE:XPEV) soaring over the coming year. Like the other stocks in this list, XPEV has fallen on hard times. Shares are down 50% in 2024 as EV sales growth stalls globally. Although the EV maker itself reported a 20% increase in deliveries in Q1, that’s dramatically fewer deliveries than 171% increase reported in Q4 of 2023. And it’s not alone in that regard. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and homegrown rival BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDY) also reported a significant dropoff in sales. So, it doesn’t bode well for long-term growth. That’s why Wall Street’s buy rating with a 140% gain for Xpeng stock is curious. At the high end of target price estimates, analysts see the EV stock soaring over 250% higher. It may be difficult to see that materializing.  To realize the 20% increase in deliveries this quarter, Xpeng had to double the incentives offered on its G9 model SUV and extend others. Even then, Xpeng was only able to cross over the lower end of its guidance for 21,000 to 22,500 deliveries in Q1. Ultimately, it had 21,821 for the period. That was just one-third of the 60,000 deliveries reported for Q4. While Xpeng stock might rise above its current $7.40 per share level, I don’t see it doubling in value, let alone jumping 140% higher.

      "It’s a lackluster trading session on Wall Street, with the main indices experiencing slight declines as traders adopt a cautious stance ahead of a data-heavy week. The spotlight will be on Wednesday’s release of March inflation data, with consensus among economists anticipating another uptick in the annual inflation rate from 3.2% to 3.4%, potentially causing further turbulence in expectations regarding imminent Fed rate cuts. According to the CME Group Fed watch tool, there is currently nearly a 50-50 chance between a hold and a cut in June.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips The Magnificent 7 stocks were in a league just over a year ago. Nowadays, the group has fallen through, with many folks narrowing down the exclusive basket to six, now five or four. At this pace, we may be left with just one Magnificent stock standing as Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) continues its epic rally on the back of the AI boom. Let’s not be so quick to give up on the companies within the group that have lost their way. Long-term investors should be willing to give them at least a few years (let’s say three) to let them pick up traction again. Remember, we should not look to the past year of magnificence when picking individual names from the cohort. Instead, we should look to the stocks we think could be most magnificent over the next year or two, regardless of how they’ve fared in the past quarter or year. Here are three that I think are equipped for a magnificent rest of 2024. Meta Platforms is showing no signs of losing its luster. The stock has added more than 52% in year-to-date gains to its impressive past-year surge. Even at new highs of $527 and change, I still find META stock incredibly cheap relative to its AI- and metaverse-powered growth prospects.  At writing, shares of Meta Platforms trade at 26.3 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E), not fitting my definition of an expensive stock, especially for a firm leveraging generative AI more effectively than most in its industry. Looking ahead, AI could easily continue paving the way for new highs. As more people purchase their first virtual reality headsets, perhaps Meta’s metaverse may begin to be seen as a source of strength rather than an expense builder. In any case, I wouldn’t give up on the stock here. It’s still cheap at new highs, in my books. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the Magnificent Seven companies that some critics may think should be removed from the group. I’m not one of them. The company is still innovating, perhaps at a much faster pace than investors believe. As Apple Vision Pro launches into new markets later this year, while the firm looks to finally reveal some of the finer details of its AI ambitions, perhaps it’s too soon to shed your portfolio of AAPL stock. A recent Bloomberg report suggested that Apple is looking into creating home robots after ditching its Apple Car plans. That’s an intriguing report, but not everybody’s convinced by the potential of robots to fuel growth for the tech giant. Dan Ives of Wedbush stated such a move would be a “black eye moment” for Apple. Harsh words. But I think he’s right in that Apple should be emphasizing AI more than experimenting with new hardware concepts.  Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock was the first out of the Magnificent Seven group. But whether it can work its way back in is another question entirely. I think it can, especially as Elon Musk looks to prove to the world that Tesla is not just an automobile company but a tech company on the cusp of disrupting big markets with its innovations. Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood is a Tesla believer, having picked up TSLA stock numerous times in recent months. A robotaxi event scheduled for August 8 will be a pivotal moment for Musk and the future of his electric vehicle (EV) empire as it looks to reverse course after a horrid past two years. Now down 60%, I have to say shares seem a tad too oversold, especially for those who believe that Tesla has a front-row seat to the full self-driving revolution. In short, Tesla isn’t magnificent right now. But come August, I think it could prove its doubters wrong. On the date of publication, Joey Frenette owned shares of Apple.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips U.S. equities have continued to trend downward as investors and market analysts reassess the prospects of a market crash. As of last Friday, the S&P 500 has increased by 9.11% on a year-to-date (YTD) basis, while the Nasdaq has risen 6.91%. These figures are well below where the indices had risen after Q1 wrapped: both had risen above 10% for the year. The burgeoning electric vehicle (EV) market has also seen better days. Slower sales growth and price wars have impacted many EV stocks to buy. The Global X Autonomous & Electric Vehicles ETF (NASDAQ:DRIV), which holds around 84 EV and autonomous vehicles stocks, has been flat YTD, underscoring the fact many EV stocks have struggled to perform against the general market. Interest rates remain elevated, and the Federal Reserve does not want to be hasty about cutting them either. These conditions will make it harder for consumers to buy new vehicles, including EVs. In this market, investors need to know which EV stocks to sell. Below are three EV stocks to sell before a broader market crash. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is undoubtedly one of the largest and most prominent players in the global EV market. Unfortunately, the U.S. EV manufacturer has been struggling. TSLA shares have dipped nearly 34% since the start of 2024. For some folks, Tesla’s stock may be approaching “buy territory,” but investors should not rush into it, as the EV maker’s shares are not out of the woods yet. In March, Tesla’s vehicle deliveries dropped 8.5% year-over-year (YoY), falling quite short of Wall Street’s estimates.  Let’s recall that in 2023, to mitigate the ever-prescient EV slump, Tesla pursued a controversial but largely successful price-cut strategy the automaker began to pursue that increased quarterly deliveries while also placing pressure on gross margins. Fast forward to now, the grim guidance Tesla gave at the beginning of 2024 appears to be coming to fruition. The EV maker’s valuation multiple still remains high despite having dropped significantly over the past few months. In particular, TSLA shares are trading around 54.6x forward earnings. Given that equities can fall even further, Tesla is probably a stock people should dump for now, especially as the company’s valuation continues to be high. The electric vehicle (EV) market slump continues to overwhelm EV producers worldwide. Nio (NYSE:NIO) stock is one of the up-and-coming China-based EV startups that has been gravely affected by weaker demand in the burgeoning car market. Nio’s share price has fallen nearly 51% YTD. As the company continues to falter, investors still holding the stock should really reconsider their judgment. The Chinese EV maker has also experienced sluggish delivery growth respective to its competitors. EV deliveries in 2023 came in at 160,038, up only 30% YoY. BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDY), NIO’s key competitor in China, saw a 62% surge in full-year EV deliveries. In January, Nio delivered 10,055 vehicles, a 44% decrease from December. Similarly, in February, the EV maker delivered 8,132 vehicles, down 19% from January. Fortunately, March has been a slight reprieve for the Chinese EV maker. EV deliveries were up 14% Y0Y, a sharp contrast to Tesla.  Still, the overall EV market does not have good prospects. Increased competition in China could eventually stifle Nio’s growth in the long term despite having a good month in March. The final EV stock investors should sell is an EV charging stock: EVgo Services (NASDAQ:EVGO). EVgo is currently facing a profitability and cash-burn issue. The company’s net loss expanded from Q2’23 to Q3’23. Moreover, in its Q3 earnings press release, the company announced it was selected to add 32 fast charging stations in Colorado and Pennsylvania. Though this may seem like a win, the company is playing in a shrinking market, more and more dominated by Tesla. EVgo’s Q4 earnings report also seemed positive at first. The company beat both Wall Street’s revenue and EPS estimates, but taking into account the overall health of the EV market makes it difficult to recommend holding this name. EVGO shares are down 35% YTD, and more losses in the future are par for the course as the EV market slows in 2024.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips China is home to one of the biggest economies in the world, and after lifting its long, strict COVID regulations, it is on the rebound. Despite slow growth in the second half of last year, which caused many stocks to take a hit, some stocks have still persevered and produced excellent results. These three Chinese stocks have managed to overcome the economic difficulties affecting industries and continue to hold some of the best buy ratings for this year. Investors should consider these stocks for their potential with growing market shares and dominant selling performances in their respective sectors. Let’s learn about these stocks’ resilience, growth prospects and reassuring financials, which have earned them Strong Buy ratings and should put them at the top of investors’ lists this month. PDD Holdings (NASDAQ:PDD) owns and operates some of the largest e-commerce platforms in China and the world. Its most popular platform is Temu, which has the second-most monthly users behind Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).  PDD took a slight hit earlier this year, but after a Q4 earnings beat, the stock saw a considerable boost. Investors were excited by the company’s Q4 revenue of $12.52 billion and adjusted EPS of $2.40. This stock’s Strong Buy ratings also come from the optimistic consensus estimates. The company is predicted to see a 35% increase in earnings growth this year and a significant jump in revenue on top of its rebound. PDD has a dominant hold over the e-commerce market in China and continues to show impressive growth. Investors should buy now and watch as this stock takes off this year. Alibaba Group (NYSE:BABA) is another e-commerce giant based in China. Like many competitors, Alibaba has seen its fair share of trouble alongside the struggling Chinese economy. However, estimates remain confident that this stock will be among the first to return to the top with a hopeful 2024. These estimates are fueled by Alibaba’s extensive market share and continued performance despite the hurdles standing in its way. The most recent quarterly earnings report boasts $36.669 billion in revenue, showing a 5% growth from the previous year.  While it’s not the best growth, considering the economic pressure, Alibaba has showcased some of the best perseverance out of Chinese stocks. In addition, to reignite its stock price, Alibaba shared its massive share buyback initiative involving repurchasing 524 million ordinary shares during the quarter ended March 31, 2024. With its low price, now is a great time to buy Alibaba, believing in its proven ability to make an exciting return this year. One of the significant Chinese competitors to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI) reported a fantastic 2023 despite economic slowdowns and high spending. In Q4, Li Auto reported a 133.8% increase in sales from Q4 2022. The show didn’t stop there. Not only did Li Auto see an 182.2% increase in deliveries, but it also reported a free cash flow of $6.22 billion in 2023, a 1,861.8 % year-over-year increase. That’s enormous growth despite much higher operating expenses following its first fully electric EV release. That cash flow, in line with Li Auto’s current price, makes it a criminally underrated stock, with a price-to-free cash flow ratio of around 6.5. Though the company does not expect as massive of growth this year as 2023, many other EV makers report the same.  All things considered, Li Auto is too good of a deal and has prospects too promising for investors to pass up.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Nio (NYSE:NIO) stock reflects the falling prospects for high-end electric vehicles (EVs). During the last decade, the Chinese company was pitched as a direct competitor to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). Its cars were sold as status symbols in “Nio Houses” to China’s millennial go-getters.  Nio was also an innovator in swapping out batteries to maintain range. But Nio has never scaled its production, producing just 160,038 cars in 2023, its best year yet. Investors have had enough. The stock is down by half in 2024. Can things get better? Nio has a plan for that.  Nio launched a “Chevy” strategy last year. It is focusing on the mid-market with new lines called Onvo and Firefly. The Onvo is a family car like the Tesla Model Y. The Firefly (which will likely get a name change) is a sedan like the Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VWAGY) ID.3. The Onvo will launch in the next quarter, and the Firefly next year. The Onvo will be priced from $28,000-$42,000, while the Firefly will start at just $14,000. The new cars respond to a new market reality. It’s not enough to make a nice car. You must scale production and deliver a price ordinary people can afford. BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDF) now drives the market with prices of $25,000 and less. Nio can follow the market leader thanks to $2.2 billion raised last year from Abu Dhabi.  The money comes with some strings, like a licensing deal for a new Arab luxury EV called the Forseven.  This is the second bailout Nio has taken. The first came during the pandemic, a $1.4 billion investment from a Chinese state government. Nio spent 2023 trying to become self-sufficient again. Nio lost $756 million last year on sales of $2.4 billion. It has yet to turn a profit and losses are widening. It ended the year with $7 billion of cash and short term investments. It’s clear what consumers want. We want an EV with the range and price of a gas-powered car. Nio can deliver that with the Onvo and Firefly, maintaining the range with quick battery swaps. A new battery recently let CEO William Li drive one of his cars 648 miles on a single charge. That was using a semi-solid battery that prioritizes range at some sacrifice in power output.  Nio has been talking to rivals about licensing its battery swap technology for two years. Geely (OTCMKTS:GELYF) has signed up for battery swaps with Nio, which now has over 2,300 swap stations. But it takes money to support the technology, and the value is questionable. CATL, now the dominant supplier of EV batteries, has licensed Nio’s battery swap technology. But it’s also hoping to just make batteries last longer. Samsung (OTCMKTS:SSNLF) has a battery that lasts 20 years on its product roadmap . Li has always compared himself to Elon Musk. He certainly has Musk’s salesmanship skills. The company’s original backer was Tencent (OTCMKTS:TCEHY), then one of China’s Cloud Emperors. Then, he got money from the government. Now, he has money from Abu Dhabi. Li, and Nio stock are running as fast as they can to stay in the game. Analysts at Tipranks call the stock no more than a hold. As with Tesla, bulls at Stocktwits see it as more of a charging and battery technology play than a car company. Li’s chief talent turns out to be convincing big money to lose money with him. Most investors agree with that now, which is why the stock price has been cut in half. The canary in the EV coal mine has had a great run, but it’s running out of oxygen.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY) layoffs are in the news Monday after the therapeutic solutions company announced changes to how it will handle research and development going forward. Sanofi wants to focus more on Phase 3 clinical trials and will be reducing its other R&D projects. As a result, many of the company employees in this division are facing layoffs. It’s still unclear how many employees will be affected by the layoffs. The cuts were announced in an email to workers last week. A town hall meeting scheduled for this week may reveal more details about how many jobs are being cut. Raquel Mura, Head of North America R&D at Sanofi, said the following in the email obtained by Fierce Biotech:  “This has been difficult for all of our R&D U.S. colleagues, but especially for those impacted […] While we seek to employ as many impacted employees as possible within Sanofi when changes are implemented, there will be people impacted by these changes.” Many large companies have announced layoffs recently due to headwinds. That includes still high inflation and interest rates. This has also seen several other players in the pharmaceutical space reduce their workforces. SNY stock is largely unmoved on Monday morning after news of the layoffs broke. It also isn’t seeing much trading with only 117,000 shares exchanged. For the record, its daily average trading volume is about 1.9 million shares. Investors looking for all of the hottest stock market stories are in luck!

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) layoffs are a hot topic on Monday as the technology retailer made major cuts to its Geek Squad support jobs. Former employees of Best Buy who were part of its Geek Squad division took to Reddit (NYSE:RDDT) over the weekend to discuss layoffs at the company. The unofficial Geek Squad subreddit was filled with workers talking about the fact that they were laid off last week. Best Buy has yet to release a statement concerning these layoffs. That means we don’t know just how many employees were affected. The same holds true as for the reason for the layoffs. Even so, one previous Geek Squad employee says that the Best Buy layoffs were the result of the company no longer being able to pay them. This came alongside other workers reporting that their hours had been cut significantly in the year leading up to the job cuts.  Here’s one of those comments, per PC Mag: “It sucks, I spent more than half my life with this company and sacrificed a lot of personal time and experiences just to be let go […] At the same time, for me it’s for the best, haven’t been scheduled 40 hours since last year and it’s a struggle to get by so I’m off to a better job and better things.” These layoffs are likely an extension of previous job cuts at Best Buy. This comes as the retailer looks to reduce costs while also switching its focus to artificial intelligence (AI). It’s also not too surprising that Best Buy would announce new layoffs. The retail sector is still under pressure from increased inflation and interest rates. This has many consumers cutting back on non-essential shopping. BBY stock is up slightly as of Monday morning.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk said the company will unveil its robotaxi on Aug. 8. The robotaxi is designed for autonomous driving without pedals or a steering wheel. The announcement sent TSLA stock up 2% over the weekend. It is expected to open this morning at $171 per share, a market capitalization of about $537 billion. Critics are calling the announcement, made on Musk’s X social media platform, a distraction. The company reported lower deliveries in the first quarter and has repeatedly failed to deliver full self-driving (FSD).  Autonomous driving technology has proven difficult to implement since Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) began working on it 15 years ago. The main problem is that the cars can’t deal with the unpredictability of human beings. They also have trouble distinguishing real hazards, like light poles, from fake hazards like traffic cones. Alphabet now offers Waymo automated taxi service in Phoenix and San Francisco, but is trying to expand it to other cities. Tesla has promised self-driving cars since 2016. Last year, the National Transportation Safety Board concluded that Tesla’s technology can be misused. Most worrisome to financial analysts is that Musk seems to be walking away from promises of a $25,000 car that could compete with BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDF) and other Chinese brands. The company teased a “next generation” vehicle at its January earnings call. Analysts have been souring on TSLA stock, with seven of 35 at Tipranks recently calling it a sell and just nine calling it a buy. At Stocktwits, sentiment is called extremely bearish. I have long been bearish on Tesla, which means I missed its rise. But I have maintained that position, especially since the launch of the Cybertruck, which I called a distraction.  Time will tell whether Tesla can deliver on its self-driving promises. Time seems to be what Musk is buying. But sales must pick up for the stock to recover.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Down more than 35% on a year-to-date basis, Lucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID) stock has been an under-performer, to say the least. Now, the overall EV sector has been hit hard by a number of headwinds. Some of these are macro and sector-specific. However, like many of the harder-hit EV names, Lucid has production and deliveries problems. And while the company’s management team has done a good job of securing outside investment (we’ll get to that), there are still substantial losses and additional cash burn that will need to be funded moving forward. Uncertainty around this aspect of the company’s business in the context of slowing demand is what has many investors concerned. Lucid CEO Rawlinson himself has warned against banking solely on continued Saudi investments, noting the risk of assuming infinite wealth. Initial excitement over the Saudi funding spike in shares quickly subsided, with prices reverting to pre-announcement levels. Here’s more on why I think LCID stock may be too risky to buy at current levels, despite appearing cheap at first glance.  Lucid’s high-end EV sedans have certainly caught on among certain buyers. I’ve seen a number of these vehicles on the road myself. And looking at these cars’ specs, I can see why EV buyers would opt for a Lucid over, say, a Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). Based on almost every metric, they’re better quality vehicles. The thing is, at this price point, there are simply a number of competitive options at better price points car buyers may gravitate toward. I’m all for quality, but price matters. And given where interest rates are, this goes double for those with squeezed credit or who carry higher uncertainty about the future. I think many of the same problems Tesla is running into are the same problems Lucid will continue to face moving forward. Demand remains depressed, and will likely continue to be, until rates drop significantly. If that doesn’t happen, the company’s cash burn based on its current run rate (and even some production growth) may not suffice. Additional capital infusions could kill the investment thesis around this stock, as existing investors get diluted or the company’s balance sheet is swamped with debt. Ayar Third Investment Company, an affiliate of Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, recently purchased $1 billion of Lucid Group preferred stock shares. PIF holds a significant 60% stake in Lucid, raising concerns about the potential impact on LCID stock if it divests shares. This isn’t the first time PIF has invested heavily in Lucid. Previously, it acquired over $1.8 billion worth of shares, coinciding with a decline in LCID stock from mid-2023. Despite the PIF’s substantial share acquisition in Lucid Group, historical trends suggest no guarantee of stock price growth. Lucid faced ongoing challenges: producing fewer vehicles than anticipated, high pricing, and limited profitability with widening losses.  Although there was a recent $1 billion share purchase, Lucid’s substantial cash burn of $1 billion per quarter remains a pressing concern. Rising interest rates are putting a squeeze on potential Lucid buyers, and with cheaper options in this space, there’s likely to be more demand-side pressures down the road. Lucid’s high-quality EVs are certainly in a class of their own. If given the option and a blank check to buy a particular EV right now, I’d probably pick a Lucid. But the problem is, I don’t have unlimited money, and there are so many options out there at lower price points to consider. I’m not the only one who feels this way – the company is burning through its order backlog, with little future demand on the horizon (at least according to analysts). Combined with production-related issues, this is a stock I can see lagging for some time. Maybe there’s a value argument that can be made here. But for now, I’m not going to be the one to make that argument, as I think this stock could have much further to decline before it’s all said and done.

      "In a report released today, Toni Sacconaghi from Bernstein maintained a Sell rating on Tesla (TSLA – Research Report), with a price target of $120.00. Toni Sacconaghi has given his Sell rating due to a combination of factors including intense competition and internal challenges Tesla may face. The analyst points out that while Tesla’s proposed $25K Model 2 could expand the company’s market, competitors like BYD are already offering similar or even lower-priced models with favorable features. Sacconaghi suggests that the arrival of Tesla’s more affordable models will not be as disruptive as previous launches, mainly because competitors have significantly closed the gap in price and performance.  Furthermore, Sacconaghi raises concerns about the potential cannibalization of Tesla’s existing models by the introduction of the Model 2, particularly as the current lineup ages. The sales for Tesla’s higher-end models have already seen a decline, indicating potential saturation or market shift. Despite the expanded market that a lower-priced Tesla could bring, the analyst believes that the combined effect of strong competition and the risk of internal cannibalization may dampen the expected positive impact on Tesla’s unit volumes, justifying the Underperform rating. In another report released on April 5, Wells Fargo also maintained a Sell rating on the stock with a $125.00 price target.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Editor’s Note: This. article was previously published under the name “Investing in the Next Wave of Explosive AI Growth” in February 2024. It has since been updated to reflect the most recent data. So far this year, the world’s leading AI chipmaker – Nvidia (NVDA) – has made it abundantly clear that the AI Boom is here. And the party’s just getting started. The tech firm reported in February that its revenues rose more than 260% in the last quarter of 2023. And management also said that revenues will rise another 230% this quarter, too. That’s got the mainstream media and most investors obsessing over Nvidia’s hyperbolic growth.  Then, in March, the company kicked off its GPU Technology Conference (GTC) with a keynote speech from CEO Jensen Huang. Huang headlined his keynote speech with the launch of Blackwell — Nvidia’s next-gen chip architecture that will enable the creation of faster, smaller, and better AI chips. Meanwhile, the most important players in this industry – including Nvidia itself – have already moved on to the next big thing: something we’re calling AI 2.0. We’ve been following these developments for a while now. We’re confident it will be the next wave of major AI growth. And it seems it’s just now hitting its major inflection point. In fact, we just learned that Nvidia itself is betting big on this next iteration. And it isn’t alone.  Microsoft (MSFT) – the world’s largest AI company – is betting big on AI 2.0, too. So are OpenAI, the world’s most influential AI startup, Amazon (AMZN), Tesla (TSLA) and Samsung. Not to mention the world’s richest men, Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos. Right now, all are pouring millions of dollars into AI 2.0. That means it’s time for you to join in and bet alongside them. So, what exactly is AI 2.0?  The real-world application of AI technologies via humanoid robots. Yes, I’m talking about AI-powered robots like the ones you’ve seen in science-fiction movies like “iRobot.” This application may seem like a pie-in-the-sky dream. But humanoid robots are already in development. This new AI wave is here. Don’t believe me? Well, Nvidia also recently announced the introduction of the Project GROOT Foundation AI model, designed to enhance the performance of humanoid robots, alongside a new system-on-a-chip named Thor for robotic use. This move comes as notable companies such as OpenAI, Microsoft (MSFT), Tesla (TSLA) (more on that in a moment), Amazon (AMZN), and Intel (INTC) heavily invest in humanoid robot development. With Nvidia joining the fray, the advent of sophisticated robots appears imminent. And we’re head over heels for this compelling investment opportunity in AI robotics.  In fact, as I write, Tesla is busy developing a humanoid robot called Optimus. And already, it can do things like fold clothes, make eggs, exercise, and dance. Tesla sees a world in the not-too-distant future where these robots are everywhere, helping people all across the globe complete menial tasks like cooking, cleaning, organizing, and more. Elon Musk is even on record saying that in time, Optimus could be bigger than Tesla’s core vehicle business. And we don’t think he’s delusional. If he is, then it seems Jeff Bezos must be, too. The former Amazon founder and CEO is reportedly pouring $100 million into a humanoid robot startup called FigureAI.  Clearly, he sees a bright future for humanoid robots as well. And guess who else is investing in FigureAI? Bezos’ old company, Amazon. The titan is pouring $50 million into FigureAI. So is Microsoft, with a $95 million commitment to the startup – not to mention $50 million from Nvidia, too. Or how about OpenAI? The ChatGPT creator is already FigureAI’s biggest investor, and it’s throwing another $5 million into the firm. Plus, Intel (INTC) and Samsung are also reportedly investing in FigureAI right now as well. Folks, it seems the writing is on the wall.

      "Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) pulled back over 6% intraday on Friday before recouping some of those losses and yet settled over 3% lower for the day. The downside catalyst was a Reuters report that said the electric-vehicle giant could be pulling the plug on its sub-$30,000 EV, although CEO Elon Musk took to social media to refute the report. Amid the stock plunge, Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest accumulated another tranche of Tesla shares. What Happened: Ark through two of its actively-managed exchange-traded funds bought 133,975 Tesla shares valued at $22.09 million (based on the closing price of $164.90). The details of the purchases are as follows: Wood is a firm believer in Tesla and Musk and her firm has a $2,000 price target for the stock by 2027. Much of the celebrity stock picker’s optimism regarding Tesla is premised on the huge potential the planned robotaxi services offer. Why It’s Important: Friday’s sell-off reflected investor worries over a further volume weakness in the absence of a low-end model, especially as the economic conditions remain challenging. Future Fund’s Gary Black, who has been very vocal about the need for a low-end EV, said shelving the low-end platform and doubling down on the full self-driving (FSD) software would be “very risky and institutions would dump the stock since there would be little growth and high pricing risk until the robotaxi materialized — or not.”  But Deepwater Asset Management’s Gene Munster said this was the right move for Tesla. “Being the first to do full autonomy at scale is huge first mover advantage. While the event is in August, my guess is we see Robotaxi’s on the road in 2027,” he said. Ark added more Tesla shares to its portfolio this week. Ahead of the deliveries update on Monday, the firm bought $14.75 million shares and following the update, it added another $39.16 million shares. It paused Tesla buying in the next two sessions before adding more shares on Friday. With this Ark beefed up its Tesla holdings by $76 million in value terms this week alone. Tesla is Ark’s flagship ETF ARRK’s second biggest holding, with a portfolio weighting of about 9.5%. Ark’s Liquidations: Friday, Ark continued selling two of its crypto-linked portfolio stocks, namely Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) and Robinhood Markets, Inc. (NASDAQ:HOOD). It sold 62,615 Coinbase shares, valued at $15.08 million, and 925,585 Robinhood shares valued at $17.03 million.  ARKK closed Friday session down 0.32% at $47.12, according to Benzinga Pro data.

      "Remarks from Federal Reserve officials alongside new economic data significantly shaped investor sentiment over the last week. The U.S. economy continues to demonstrate resilience, with the manufacturing sector returning to expansion after 16 months of contraction and the labor market adding 303,000 new jobs in March, surpassing economist expectations. Buoyed by this positive economic momentum, recent public statements from Federal Reserve officials have tempered expectations of an imminent interest rate cut, with Fed governors reiterating the need to see more positive data on disinflation. Wall Street saw a varied performance this week, with uncertainty regarding monetary policy taking the spotlight. Energy stocks, as tracked by the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLE), notably stood out as oil prices surged to their highest levels in over six months, inching closer to $90 a barrel. Apple’s Robotics Ambition  Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is reportedly shifting its focus from electric vehicle ambitions to home robotics, reflecting its continual search for the next big innovation. Initiatives include a mobile robot and a sophisticated tabletop device with a display repositioning arm aimed at redefining smart home technology. Analysts have expressed differing opinions on the possibility of Apple venturing into the realm of personal home robots. Disney's Board Wins Vote Disney Co. (NYSE:DIS) shareholders overwhelmingly supported the company's current board, decisively defeating activist shareholder nominees from Trian and Blackwell. This result solidifies CEO Bob Iger‘s leadership as Disney aims to focus on growth, value creation and maintaining its position in the entertainment industry. Demand Overwhelms Supply  Eli Lilly Co. (NYSE:LLY) faces challenges meeting the high demand for its weight loss drugs Mounjaro and Zepbound, with shortages reported on Amazon Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) Pharmacy. This situation underscores the drugs’ success and the company’s efforts to scale up manufacturing capacity. EV Penny Stock Rallies Nikola Corp. (NASDAQ:NKLA), an electric truck manufacturer, has outperformed major companies like Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Rivian Automotive Inc. (NYSE:RVN) and Lucid Group Inc. (NASDAQ:LCID) in stock performance terms so far in 2024. This growth comes after a tough 2023 for Nikola that saw stock value dips, recalls and leadership changes. Nikola’s focus on hydrogen fuel cell trucks contributes to its share price recovery, in contrast with the broader EV market’s downturn.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Full disclosure, I’m not a tremendous fan of Cathie Wood. Generally, I think she makes some terrible picks. For example, what many would consider the best Cathie Wood stocks to buy in April, and her two largest holdings were Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). Both companies’ valuations are in the stratosphere. And Coinbase is facing tremendous competition from Bitcoin (BTC-USD) ETFs, along with a potentially ruinous lawsuit by the SEC. Meanwhile Tesla is struggling amid a huge amount of competition from many veteran automakers and Chinese start-ups. However, sometimes she does make great picks. For example, she was an early believer in Tesla before the stock soared tremendously. Here are the three best Cathie Wood stocks to buy in April. I believe that these names can, like the TSLA of the past, soar impressively. Exact Sciences (NASDAQ:EXAS) specializes in developing tests for cancer. The Street has generally given the company no credit except for its colon cancer test, Cologuard, which generates huge amounts of revenue. But that could be starting to change. On March 28 the company announced positive data on a non-endoscopic esophageal cancer test. The announcement caused EXAS stock to rally. Specifically, the shares jumped about 10% between March 28 and the afternoon of April 4.  Furthermore, the revenue from a number of the company’s other tests is booming or poised to soar. For example, the overseas revenue of Exact’s Oncoptype tests climbed 48% last quarter compared with Q4 of 2022. And, the firm is predicting that the sales generated by its Predictive Oncology unit will soar to $1 billion in the not-too-distant future. The firm’s bright outlook makes it one of the best Cathie Wood stocks to buy. Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) owns the leading streaming operating system in the U.S. Unsurprisingly, with streaming on the rise, Roku’s engagement numbers are soaring. In 2023, its streaming hours jumped 20% to over 100 billion, while its net user total surged by 10 million. Ultimately, marketers buy ads based on the media that consumers are using, and Roku’s usage numbers are rapidly increasing. As a result, it’s unsurprising that the firm’s top-line rose an impressive 13.5% last quarter to $984.4 million. Given the continued, rapid proliferation of streaming, I expect Roku’s sales to continue growing quickly in the coming quarters and years.  During the pandemic, Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM) was a growth stock with a very high valuation. But now it’s actually a value stock with a rather low forward price-earnings ratio of 12.67 times. In the fourth quarter of last year, the company’s revenue from enterprise customers rose 5% versus the same period a year earlier to $667 million, while its overall sales advanced only 2.7% year-over-year to $1.15 billion. The discrepancy suggests that the firm is gaining a great deal of revenue from enterprises and slowly losing sales from consumers. Since the company makes more revenue from enterprises than from consumers and since enterprises have much bigger budgets than consumers, I think this dichotomy will cause the company’s growth to accelerate over the longer term.

      "Analysts are pulling back from the Consumer Cyclical sector as 2 experts expressed today bearish sentiments on Tesla (TSLA – Research Report) and Floor & Decor Holdings (FND – Research Report). Tesla (TSLA) In a report released today, Colin Langan  from Wells Fargo maintained a Sell rating on Tesla, with a price target of $125.00. The company’s shares closed last Friday at $164.91, close to its 52-week low of $152.37. According to TipRanks.com, Langan has currently 0 stars on a ranking scale of 0-5 stars, with an average return of -5.8% and a 47.4% success rate. Langan covers the NA sector, focusing on stocks such as Magna International, Rivian Automotive, and General Motors. Tesla has an analyst consensus of Hold, with a price target consensus of $191.67, which is a 13.4% upside from current levels.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is one of the most important stocks in the market. That means its price movements can play a great deal into how many investors’ portfolios perform on a daily basis, given the weighting of TSLA stock in many top index funds. Accordingly, today’s dip of more than 3% in TSLA stock is concerning for many direct and indirect investors. The electric vehicle (EV) maker has been on a downward trajectory of late, with recent deliveries coming in well below estimates, signaling poor demand. However, today’s decline appears to be more related to a Reuters report. The report in question suggests that Tesla has scrapped its entry-level vehicle project. These cars, which were expected to be produced under the moniker Model 2, were set to have a starting price of around $25,000. However, with this model now potentially scrapped, many in the market are clearly pricing in more downside pressure for Tesla. Let’s dive into what to make of this report — and why investors continue to sell TSLA stock today.  Today’s report, which cites two unnamed sources close to the project, confirms the concerns of certain investors who thought this project may be doomed from the start. Tesla got its start by producing high-end EVs with incredible performance specs that captivated many early investors. Whether we’re talking about the Roadster or the Model S, I have to say, Tesla made cars that were nice to look at. Likewise, later models like the X and Y and lower-priced Model 3 still sit in the “premium” or “luxury” end of the market due to their price tags. Prices have certainly come down, but not enough to challenge Chinese EV makers that are producing much more affordable vehicles, bolstering demand. Tesla’s Chinese business is slowing very quickly. Meanwhile, U.S. EV buyers have been afforded a number of other options at similar price points. So far, Musk’s strategy of cutting prices for his existing lineup isn’t working like many had hoped. The Model 2 was supposed to allow for higher prices for other Tesla models and generate a mass-market opportunity at the lower end of the market. With the project now appearing to be out of the equation, bulls have one less catalyst to rely on when putting forward a “total market domination” thesis for Tesla.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips With the electric vehicle (EV) industry at a crossroads, it might seem odd to consider wagering on the best EV stocks to buy in April. Macroeconomic headwinds and fierce competition have led to a substantial slowdown in EV sales in 2023, and the trend continues into the first quarter (Q1) this year. To top it off, whispers are growing louder that the excitement surrounding the industry has fizzled out. Despite the headwinds, EV sales are expected to rise this year and for the foreseeable future. However, it’s unlikely that we would see the same lofty growth rates we saw during the 2021 to 2022 period. Nevertheless, automakers still expect a future dominated by EVs, which makes it an opportune time to bet on the best EV stocks on the dip. Toyota Motor (NYSE:TM) may seem like an odd EV pick based on recent remarks. Company chairman Akio Toyoda believes in taking a “multi-pathway” approach for the future of its business rather than going all-in on EVs. Though his remarks were initially met with skepticism, Toyota’s diversified approach to EVs is now resonating more with the current market slowdown. This cautious yet pragmatic approach makes it one of the best low-risk EV plays. Moreover, its relatively safe strategy paid many dividends last year, with TM stock gaining more than 70% last year. As we advance, the automaker plans to sell 1.5 million electric vehicles annually by 2026. Moreover, with its leadership in hybrids and interest in hydrogen fuel-cell technology, it is poised to continue delivering sustained growth to its investors. 2023 was a solid year for its business, with it generating robust revenue and EBITDA growth of 23% and 55%, respectively.  Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI) is one of the top Chinese EV players that saw a sizeable drop in its share price last year. Its stock is down more than 19% year-to-date (YTD) despite posting impressive delivery data and triple-digit top-line growth numbers in the past year. Its March delivery data revealed a significant 39% year-over-year (YOY) increase, with 28,984 units delivered. These stellar numbers have taken its first quarter (Q1) tally to 80,400 EVs, with deliveries up almost 53% year over year. These numbers could bring its cumulative deliveries past the 700,000 mark, a milestone lauded by its chairman and CEO Xiang Li as a testament to the firm’s commitment to product excellence and user value. Furthermore, it ended last year with a massive cash buffer of $14.6 billion, with free cash flow (FCF) for Q4 at a whopping $2 billion. Therefore, Li Auto boasts incredible financial flexibility and the ability to continue investing in innovation and aggressive retail expansion. BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDY) has risen to become the global leader in the EV market. Last year, it surpassed Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), the EV pioneer. BYD’s journey from an underdog to a top dog speaks volumes about its innovative prowess and strategic vision. In Q4 last year, it sold 526,409 units, outperforming Tesla’s sales of 484,507 and marking a major milestone in the EV space. Moreover, it ended last year with an 80% improvement in profits amidst the massive increase in sales volume.  Furthermore, it has kept the momentum up this year, with total vehicle and EV sales rising 41% and 28%, respectively, in March. For Q1, total vehicle sales rose 14% to 624,398, with EV sales up a healthy 13% to 300,114. These sales were down sharply quarter-to-quarter, though, and BYD handed back the title of biggest EV carmaker to Tesla. Despite its breathtaking performance in the past few years, its stock still trades under 0.7 times forward sales estimates.

      "Editor’s note: This story has been updated with additional details. The pace of expansion in the U.S. labor market exceeded forecasts last month, dampening investor hopes for potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. U.S. employers added 303,000 nonfarm payrolls in March, marking an increase from the 270,000 reading in February and surpassing the expected 212,000, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said Friday. The unexpectedly strong jobs report intensified dwindling expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts, a sentiment already weakened by hawkish remarks from Fed speakers on Thursday. Market-implied probabilities assigned a 64% chance of a rate cut by June, prior to the jobs report, and fell to 53% following the robust employment reading.  The U.S. dollar index (DXY), as tracked by the Invesco DB USD Index Bullish Fund ETF (NYSE:UUP), rose 0.4% minutes after the release, and Treasury yields moved higher. Futures on U.S. major averages trended higher during premarket trading on Friday following a negative session on Thursday. Contracts on the S&P 500 were 0.4% higher at 8:55 a.m., while Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.5%. The tech-heavy Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) closed 1.5% a day earlier, marking the worst-performing day since late January. As Treasury yields sharply rose, bond-related ETFs tanked with the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ:TLT) down 1.3%.  A stronger dollar and higher yields also exerted pressure on precious metals.

      "In Major Hong Kong stocks, Xiaomi Corporation (HK:1810) has been in the news since it successfully marked its entry into the EV market, sparking excitement among analysts. The company began the deliveries of its SU7 model on March 28, leading to a surge in share price of 16% on Tuesday. Xiaomi received an overwhelming response, with nearly 90,000 firm orders within 24 hours of its EV launch. As per a Reuters report, potential buyers are experiencing a waiting period between four and seven months, indicating a robust demand. Overall, Xiaomi’s stock has risen nearly 20% in the last month, driven by optimism regarding the company’s EV debut. Xiaomi is a global company known for consumer electronics and smart devices. It has recently ventured into the EV sector. Xiaomi’s SU7 model is marketed as a high-performance sedan featuring advanced “super electric motor” technology, positioning it against industry giants such as Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). With claims of a superior driving range compared to its counterparts. Interestingly, the SU7 starts at a price point of $29,870, undercutting Tesla’s Model 3 by $4,000. Last month, analyst Kyna Wong from Citi maintained a Buy rating on the stock, expressing optimism about Xiaomi’s smartphone market expansion in 2024 and other opportunities like artificial intelligence (AI) and EV sales. Her price target of HK$19.60 predicts an upside of more than 25%.  Recently, CMB International analyst Alex NG maintained a Buy rating on Xiaomi stock. NG raised his price target to HK$22.19 from HK$20.25, now predicting over 45% growth. NG believes the company’s EV launch has been positively received by the market, and the pre-orders have exceeded market expectations. In the short term, he anticipates that investors will focus on the momentum of pre-orders, shipment growth, and consumer response over the next two months. Moving forward, CMB maintains a positive outlook and has adjusted its forecasts to accommodate EV shipments of 80,000, 150,000, and 200,000 for FY24, FY25, and FY26, respectively. On TipRanks, 1810 stock has been assigned a Strong Buy rating based on nine Buys and one hold recommendation from analysts. The Xiaomi share price target is HK$20.51, which is 32% above the current trading level. Disclosure\n"

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips MediaCo (NASDAQ:MDIA) stock is rising higher on Friday after the company updated investors on the stake held by Standard General L.P.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips April is a great time to invest in the stock market, but only if you know where to find the best stocks. Conversely, you need to be able to identify F-rated stocks to sell in April if you’re going to keep your portfolio out of the red. This is no time to leave money on the table. Since 1945, April has averaged an average return in the market of 1.6%. That may not sound like a lot, but it ties December for the best-performing month of the year on average. While there are some great companies out there for your investments, the Portfolio Grader can also identify stocks that represent weak companies that you should avoid at all costs. While the names on this list represent a variety of sectors, they have some common threads. These companies are plagued by poor decisions and performance, weak earnings, a lack of growth and weak analyst sentiment.  If you’re holding any of these companies, it’s time to protect your capital, improve your portfolio and rebalance it into stocks that give you a better chance for success. Lucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID) shares saw a spike last month when it entered into a subscription agreement with the Public Investment Fund’s Ayar Third Investment Company in Saudi Arabia. The deal calls for Lucid to provide 10,000 Series A convertible preferred shares in exchange for a $1 billion investment. But the novelty of that deal is already fading or perhaps investors are realizing how much their shares are being diluted. The preferred shares represent 278.15 million shares of Lucid common stock. Either way, Lucid stock has already returned most of its recent gains and is again on a downward slope. LCID only produced 6,000 vehicles in 2023 and badly needs a strong 2024 to regain relevance. Revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $157.1 million, down from $257.7 million a year ago. The company reported a loss of $736.8 million for the quarter and $3.1 billion for the full year.  LCID stock is down 35% in 2024 and gets an “F” rating in the Portfolio Grader. Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) is an alternative energy producer. The company makes a battery that uses hydrogen and oxygen to produce electricity. The only byproduct is water vapor, making it an appealing option for businesses and communities that want to lower their carbon footprint. But while Plug Power seems great in theory, the reality hasn’t measured up. Hydrogen fuel cells haven’t been profitable yet for the company, and Plug announced a cost-savings plan to trim expenses by $75 million. The company is also banking on a $1.6 billion loan facility that it’s hoping to secure with the U.S. government to help it maintain liquidity. The company brought in revenue of $891 million for the fourth quarter, up 27% from a year ago. But losses increased to $2.30 per share from $1.25 per share.  PLUG stock is down 28% in 2024. It gets an “F” rating in the Portfolio Grader. Fisker (OTCMTKS:FSRN) is another electric vehicle stock that is actually in much worse shape than Lucid Group. The company used to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker “FSR” but the exchange suspended trading, citing an “abnormally low” stock price. The delisting will require Fisker to offer to repurchase its 2026 unsecured 2.5% convertible notes and default on its 2025 senior secured notes. The default would mean that holders of the 2025 notes should receive all note payments immediately. But Fisker also disclosed that it doesn’t have the money or credit line to pay those debts.  Fisker was also the subject of a TechCrunch report indicating that the company misplaced and temporarily lost track of customer funds worth millions of dollars. Revenue in the fourth quarter was $200.1 million with a net loss of $463.6 million. FSRN stock is down 98% since its delisting and gets an “F” rating in the Portfolio Grader. AMC Entertainment Holdings (NYSE:AMC) operates 900 movie theaters worldwide with a total of 10,000 screens. But a weakened movie market has hampered recently the company, thanks to the rise of streaming services and the writers’ strike that hit Hollywood last year. And it’s not as if this company was strong to start with. AMC took a beating during the Covid-19 pandemic, and it’s best known over the last few years as a nostalgic meme stock more than anything. Nostalgia certainly has its place, but not when you’re an investor. You can’t hold on to a stock just because the company gave you warm fuzzy feelings when you were a kid.  Revenue in the fourth quarter was $1.1 billion, up from $990 million a year ago. AMC also reduced its losses from $287.7 million and $2.64 per share in Q4 2022 to $182 million and 83 cents per share in the most recent quarter. AMC is still saddled with a massive amount of debt ($4.6 billion). It announced plans to sell $250 million in shares to pay some of that off, but that also resulted in share dilution that sent AMC down 15% last week. In all, AMC is down 50% in 2024. It gets an “F” rating in the Portfolio Grader. Speaking of meme stocks and nostalgia, let’s talk about GameStop (NYSE:GME). GameStop is the original meme stock that was the subject of a correctly titled film, Dumb Money, in 2023. Dumb Money documented the 2021 GME short squeeze that was fueled by social media and retail investors who saw an opportunity to squeeze hedge fund investment firms that had been shorting GameStop stock in anticipation of continued drops.  The squeeze resulted in massive gains for GME stock, but they only lasted for days before the entire house of cards collapsed. But that’s history. Investing should be about the present and anticipating the future, and both of those look weak for GameStop shares. Fourth-quarter revenue was $1.79 billion, down from $2.22 billion in the same quarter a year ago. Earnings were up slightly, to $63.1 million and 21 cents per share from $48.2 million and 16 cents per share. Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter lowered his price target for GME from $6 to $5 following the earnings report. Even that may be optimistic. GameStop stock is down 35% in 2024 and gets an “F” rating in the Portfolio Grader.  I’ve written a few times in the last several months about Mullen Automotive (NASDAQ:MULN) in an attempt to warn investors away from this EV stock. It’s not like I enjoy pointing out the company’s flaws. But I think it’s important to sound a loud and clear alert that this is a company to avoid. Consider that Mullen only delivered 396 vehicles in the fourth quarter of 2023. Or that the stock dropped by more than 99% in the last 12 months. Mullen has gone to incredible lengths to try to keep on a major index and avoid Fisker’s fate. But in doing so the company executed three reverse stock splits in 2023, including a 1-for-100 split in December. And even then, I’m not convinced that MULN will remain more than $1 per share for much longer.  Mullen’s only hope aside from a fourth reverse split is that its pivot to commercial EVs will give it an opportunity to avoid total collapse. It’s not a bet I’m willing to make. MULN stock is down 68% in 2024 and continues to carry a well-deserved “F” in the Portfolio Grader. Hertz Global Holdings (NASDAQ:HTZ) is a vehicle rental company that operates as Hertz, Dollar Rent a Car, Firefly Car Rental and Thrifty Car Rental. Hertz has been plagued by bad decisions that should leave investors wary. Following the Covid-19 lockdowns that crippled the auto rental industry, Hertz bet big on EVs, hoping that the fleet would be appealing to customers. But when Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) cut prices on its cars across the board and other EV makers followed suit, Hertz was left with a high-priced fleet with a much weaker resale value.  Now Hertz is looking at cutting its EV fleet from 60,000 to 20,000, taking a $245 million charge in depreciation and repairs and recording its biggest quarterly loss ($348 million) since the Covid-19 pandemic. Now that CEO Stephen Scherr stepped down, investors may be tempted to give Hertz another chance to get it right. But I don’t recommend it. HTZ stock is down 26% in 2024 and gets an “F” rating in the Portfolio Grader.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Investors who added Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) positions in early 2024 likely face disappointment, with many hoping for a potential rebound. Formerly the world’s largest EV maker, there are clear catalysts with this company that support the incredibly high valuation of Tesla stock. That said, there are reasons why this stock remains depressed. Investors are increasingly viewing Tesla as a car company (something I argue it is, and has been since its inception), requiring a lower multiple. Price cuts, increased competition, and other factors are certainly driving a bearish narrative in this name right now. Here are two reasons why I think TSLA stock remains a strong sell among mega-cap tech-related names right now. Tesla reported a drop in quarterly deliveries, missing Wall Street estimates amid stiff competition and price cuts. Tesla stock fell 5.2%, though I thought the daily decline could have been a lot worse, with the company only losing $30 billion in value.  The decline marks a shift for Tesla, which is now clearly facing a slowdown because of market conditions and competition. With deliveries down 8.5% in Q1, Tesla produced 433,371 vehicles but missed analyst expectations of 454,200. More importantly, the company only delivered less than 370,000 vehicles, meaning it’s over producing. This should lead to further strain on prices, and greater dealer incentives to get these models off the lot. In the absence of a true model refresh, Tesla’s offerings are beginning to look stale to certain investors. There’s the reality that Musk’s personality is a turn-off for many potential buyers, who happen to be largely in Democratic states. During a recent event, Xiaomi’s CEO Lei Jun announced that the company’s SU7 model would be priced at 215,900 yuan and the Max version at 299,900 yuan.  Within the first 27 minutes, Xiaomi received over 50,000 orders, marking its entry into the electric car market amidst a global sales slowdown and price competition. Xiaomi now competes with EV giants like Tesla and BYD, pricing in a way that undercuts Tesla’s Model 3 starting price in China. Mr. Lei highlighted that the SU7 would boast a minimum range of 700km (435 miles), surpassing the Tesla Model 3’s 567km. Xiaomi aims to leverage its shared operating system across devices to attract its extensive customer base. As the third-largest global smartphone seller with a 12% market share, Xiaomi’s SU7, teased since last year, draws comparisons to Porsche models. The SU7 production will start in Beijing, where the company is expected to produce 200,00 vehicles every year. A survey by market intelligence firm Caliber shows declining interest among potential Tesla buyers in the United States, partly attributed to CEO Elon Musk’s polarizing image. Despite aggressive price cuts boosting sales last year, Tesla is anticipated to announce subdued quarterly sales soon. According to Reuters, caliber’s “consideration score” for Tesla plummeted from 70% in November 2021 to 31% in February.  Tesla isn’t the brand it once was. There are other options out there, and like it or not, competition in China and other key markets is only going to heat up. I really don’t see how Tesla’s valuation is justified anymore, considering the market now views the company increasingly as a car maker, and less as a software or tech company. I’d argue that’s all Tesla has been since its inception, but that take has fallen on mostly deaf ears. I think Tesla could have much more downside from here, and it’s a strong sell for me. Get out while you still can.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips The electric vehicle industry is going through challenging times. The concerns for the industry include competition and macroeconomic headwinds. As a result, global automakers are scaling back on their EV investment plans. From a price action perspective, EV stocks have trended lower and there are multiple undervalued stories. In my view, it’s a good time to buy for investors with a long-term horizon. This column specifically focuses on undervalued battery stocks to buy before the next rally. This has led to these 7 battery stocks to buy before the next big rally. It’s worth noting that in 2022, EVs accounted for only 14% of new cars sold. There is ample scope for industry growth with policy tailwinds. It’s estimated that by 2030, more than 60% of new cars sold will be EVs. This will translate into significant demand for batteries. To put things into perspective, the global demand for Li-ion battery is expected to increase from 700 GWh in 2022 to approximately 4.7 TWh by 2030. This will provide ample headroom for growth for some of the best battery players. Let’s talk about 7 battery stocks to buy before the next big rally.  With the broad EV sector being depressed, Panasonic Holdings (OTCMKTS:PCRFY) stock has done well. In the last 12 months, the stock has total returns of over 10%. It’s worth noting that PCRFY stock trades at a forward price-earnings ratio of 7.3. I would bet on the stock doubling within the next 24 months. At the same time, the blue-chip EV battery stock is worth holding until 2030. On the innovation front, Panasonic is working on batteries with a silicon-based technology. This can give electric cars a 500-mile range and charge refills in 10 minutes. The Company is also working on solid-state batteries for drones and factory robots. This can open-up another big addressable market and boost long term growth. It’s one of the 7 battery stocks to buy before the next big rally. Besides the innovation factor, Panasonic has ambitious EV battery capacity expansion plans. The Company plans to boost capacity to 200GWh by 2031. This would imply quadrupling of capacity as compared to the last financial year. The expansion plan provides revenue growth visibility in addition to potential EBITDA margin expansion in the coming years. QuantumScape (NYSE:QS) is a development stage company with focus on commercialization of solid-state batteries. With more than a decade of focus on research and development, the Company has 300 patents or patent applications. QuantumScape also claims to have agreements with six automotive OEMs. Once the solid-state battery is commercialized, there is a strong platform for growth. I must add here that Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VWAGY) is a strategic investor and joint venture partner in the Company. This adds to the credibility and makes QS stock an attractive investment after a deep correction in the last few years.  In a major business development, the Company recently shipped Alpha-2 prototype battery cells to automotive partners. This is a significant step towards the roadmap to deliver QSE-5 (first commercial product). With the Company targeting high-volume production of its solid-state electrolyte-separator in 2025, it’s not long before QS stock surges. This make it one of those 7 battery stocks to buy before the next big rally. After a deep correction, Solid Power (NASDAQ:SLDP) stock has stabilized and remained sideways in the last six months. I believe that the worst is over for the stock and with positive business progress, I expect a big rally in the coming quarters. As an overview, Solid Power is working towards the commercialization of solid-state batteries. The Company’s efforts are backed by automotive partners that include Ford (NYSE:F) and BMW (OTCMKTS:BMWYY). Recently, the Company also deepened its partnership with SK On. This will help in expansion in the Korean market. Last year, Solid Power successfully delivered A-1 sample cells to automotive partners October 2023 for validation testing. This year, the focus is shifted to A-2 sample cells that are likely to be better in terms of safety and performance. I also like the fact that Solid Power has been using its cash buffer conservatively. With $415 million in liquidity, there is ample flexibility to invest in research and development.  Lithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) stock has advanced by 45% in the last one month. The reason being a funding commitment of $2.26 billion from the U.S. Department of Energy for the Thacker Pass project. I believe that the positive momentum for LAC stock is likely to sustain as the growth story remains undervalued. It’s worth noting that the Thacker Pass asset will commence production in 2027. However, the market valuation of the Company is significantly lower as compared to the after-tax net present value of $5.7 billion. Over the next few years, the valuation gap is likely to be closed. I must add that once the asset commences production, the average annual EBITDA visibility is $1.1 billion. This implies healthy cash flows over the long term with the asset life estimated at 40 years. The weakness in lithium price is therefore a golden opportunity to accumulate LAC stock. Piedmont Lithium (NASDAQ:PLL) is another massively undervalued lithium stock to buy. In the last 12 months, PLL stock has plunged by 75%. The correction is overdone and with a quality asset base, I expect multibagger returns from current levels. It’s a matter of holding the stock with patience through the lithium bear market. Straight to valuations, Piedmont currently commands a market valuation of $252 million. This is miniscule as compared to the present value of the Company’s key assets. To put things into perspective, the Company’s Ghana asset has an after-tax NPV of $1.33 billion. Further, the Carolina and Tennessee asset have a combined after-tax NPV of $4.5 billion.  Of course, these assets require financing and that’s the key catalyst for PLL stock. The Company is looking for strategic partners for its U.S. assets. Once financing is secured for construction, I expect valuations to skyrocket. An important point to note is that Piedmont already has supply agreements with the likes of LG Chem and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). Extended offtake agreements can provide clear cash flow visibility. This makes it one of those 7 battery stocks to buy before the next big rally. Among the traditional car companies, Ford (NYSE:F) has ambitious plans for transition towards a portfolio of EVs. The Company’s investment plans include setting-up EV battery plans. Before discussing that, it’s worth noting that F stock trades at a forward price-earnings ratio of 7.4. Further, the stock offers an attractive dividend yield of 4.4%. The blue-chip stock is worth accumulating at the current valuation gap. In May 2021, Ford and SK On announced a joint venture to “produce approximately 60 GWh annually in traction battery cells and array modules.” It’s worth noting that Ford’s “global BEV plan calls for at least 240 gigawatt hours (GWh) of battery cell capacity by 2030.” Therefore, there is ample scope for growth in the next five years. It’s worth noting that in November 2023, Ford scaled back plans for a $3.5 billion battery plant in Michigan. It does not come as a surprise with the recent slowdown in EV sales. However, Ford has ample financial flexibility to aggressively invest in multiple plans once growth gains traction. Let’s end the discussion on battery companies with a massively undervalued penny stock. Standard Lithium (NYSE:SLI) stock has plunged by almost 70% in the last 12 months and is worth considering at current levels. In my view, SLI stock is likely to deliver 10x to 20x returns by 2030.  To put things into perspective, Standard Lithium commands a current market valuation of $210 million. In comparison, the Company’s key asset has an after-tax net present value of $4.5 billion. If other assets are included, the after-tax NPV is likely to be more than $5 billion. I believe that there are two impending catalysts for a massive rally. First, if lithium trends higher, sentiments will reverse for lithium stocks. Further, Standard Lithium needs financing of $1.2 billion for its key asset (South West Arkansas). Once the financing is secured, SLI stock is likely to go ballistic. It’s one of the 7 battery stocks to buy before the next big rally.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips China is a conundrum. With 900 million people, the country is the world’s biggest consumer market and United States companies love tapping into it. Whether it’s a new expansion opportunity or just a way to stave off slowing growth in more mature and saturated markets, companies eagerly do business there. Yet it’s problematic, too. Just ask these tech stock titans. Foremost is China’s use of slave labor. Human Rights Watch says the government uses Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslim communities in forced labor camps. Products including car parts, solar panels and apparel from businesses such as PDD Holdings‘ (NASDAQ:PDD) Temu and Schein are regularly sold in the U.S. And American companies as wide-ranging as Nike (NYSE:NKE) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) have endured scrutiny for tainting their supply chains by using forced labor products. The ongoing war in Ukraine also helped raise tensions between Washington and Beijing that spilled over into trade issues. President Biden imposed restrictions on the sale of semiconductors and advanced technology to China which retaliated with restrictions of its own. Not just in computer chips but by subsidizing local companies to challenge sales by U.S. corporations. Other businesses are simply prohibited from operating there. Twitter and Facebook are two companies banned over free speech fears. These three tech stocks facing China challenges face very high hurdles to spur sales growth.  One of the most high-profile fallouts from heightened trade tensions is China blocking Intel‘s (NASDAQ:INTC) chips from beiung used in government computers and servers. Reminiscent of the arguments U.S. politicians are using to ban TikTok or force its sale, China issued a list of “safe and reliable” CPUs, databases and operating systems companies could use. The products were all from Chinese companies. Also caught up in the ban are chips from Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Microsoft‘s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Windows operating system. But it’s a heavy blow to Intel, which was looking to China expansion to revitalize its growth efforts. Nearly 75% of Intel’s revenue comes from outside the U.S. China represents 27% of the chipmaker’s $54.2 billion total revenue, or almost $15 billion. The country also represents 15% of Advanced Micro’s $23 billion revenues. Intel’s stock is down 23% year to date as a result of disappointing guidance issued earlier this year. As trade war hawks in both political parties rail against China in an election year, don’t expect INTC stock to run much higher. It’s not just in the U.S. where the fervor for electric vehicles (EV) is subsiding. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) saw its market share in China slip to 6.6% in the first two months of 2024 from 7.6% last year as overall EV sales slowed. Coupled with increased competition from Chinese manufacturers like BYD (OTCMKTS:BDDYF), Nio (NYSE:NIO) and Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI), the going is getting tough for Tesla.  The EV maker reported first-quarter deliveries tumbled 8.5% to 386,810 vehicles where analysts had expected 457,000 deliveries. It also marked a 20% slide in sales sequentially. However, Tesla’s consolation prize was regaining the title of world’s largest EV maker after BYD reported deliveries plummeted 43% to 300,411 vehicles. All EV manufacturers are now locked in a price-cutting war that will likely decimate profits for the companies. Tesla slashed prices on its Model 3 and Model Y cars in China earlier this year. It also began offering cash discounts on Model Ys beginning Feb. 1. Now the EV maker is offering additional incentives on cars in China, including insurance, paint colors and financing options. It’s likely its rivals will respond as they did to Tesla’s earlier buyer enticements. Tesla stock is down 34% year-to-date and could go lower as sales slow and discounting heats up. Drop this and the other tech stock titans we mentioned. The third tech stock facing China challenges is Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). It saw iPhone shipments tumble 33% in February, according to Bloomberg News. There were only 2.4 million devices shipped that month but the number was affected by China’s Lunar New Year holiday. As Apple is the only cross-border company with a sizable market share in China, it bore the brunt of the decline. The tech giant has been working overtime to smooth relations in the country. CEO Tim Cook recently traveled to China to meet with government officials and open a new flagship store in Shanghai. He promised to increase Apple’s investment in China in the long run. With the new iPhone 16 due out later this year, Cook wants to ensure the road to sales is paved before its debut.  Apple also recently reached a $490 million settlement with plaintiffs in a class-action lawsuit. They alleged Cook lied to shareholders in 2019 by concealing just how bad the iPhone was selling in China. Apple surprised the market by slashing quarterly revenue forecasts by $9 billion on declining demand in China. The situation is emblematic of the ongoing difficulty U.S. companies face when doing business there. Apple stock is down 12% so far this year. This and the other tech stock titans we have mentioned need to be dropped soon.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips While Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock continues to grab headlines for being the single-biggest loser so far in 2024, there’s one major investor who thinks the electric vehicle (EV) maker is due for a recovery: Cathy Wood. The Ark Invest manager believes that Tesla’s more than 30% drawdown is just a road bump before CEO Elon Musk’s brainchild soars to new highs. How high you might ask? Wood has a $2,000 price target on TSLA stock. For context, the stock currently trades for $171 per share. Wood recently discussed her optimism for Tesla, arguing that the company is still positioned strongly for the all-electric future. “Now is not the time to run for the hills,” Wood said in an interview with CNBC.  Ark Invest recently bought up millions of dollars worth of Tesla ahead of the company’s first-quarter earnings call last week. Unfortunately, the company’s financial results were nothing short of disappointing, further digging Tesla into the red. Still, Wood believes that Tesla’s future is bright. The fund manager thinks that Tesla will hit its stride when it eventually rolls out its robotaxi business, which she estimates could contribute to $10 trillion in revenue by 2030. Wood is a long-time Tesla fan, having once maintained a price target of $5,000 per share for TSLA stock. Despite Wood’s faith, much of Wall Street has abandoned Tesla. Indeed, the EV maker has already shed more than $240 billion in value in 2024, with some analysts even claiming that the “Magnificent Seven” is now the “Fab Four,” cutting Tesla, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) from the roster. Not for nothing, Tesla has largely failed to meet expectations this year. In its recently posted Q1 financial results, the company announced a year-over-year (YOY) decline in global vehicle deliveries — for the first time since 2020.  The company has seen a sharp pullback in EV demand, attributable to a number of possible headwinds, including increased competition in China. “[It] was a messy first quarter,” noted Guggenheim Securities analyst Ronald Jewsikow. “The demand is slowing, China competition is strong, and then Europe hasn’t grown for five quarters now for Tesla. Structurally, there’s emerging risks in all three regions that, even as we move beyond a very messy first quarter earnings result, there’s reasons for concern.” Whether this once-upon-a-time EV darling reclaims its seat among new tech giants, remains to be seen.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Meme coins to sell are not a hot topic of discussion right now as we move towards the fourth Bitcoin halving in mid-April. A deflationary event like the halving often sparks a Bitcoin (BTC-USD) bull run. Bitcoin, which already notched a new all-time high of around $73,000 this year, is the bellwether for the sector. So, if it grows, so does the industry. Pretty simple logic? However, at the heart of any investment is value. Because Bitcoin functions as a hedge against inflation, investors favor it, particularly in countries like El Salvador and the Central African Republic, where it has been accepted as legal cash. In the case of Ethereum (ETH-USD), the ecosystem will be upgraded in 2024 by a number of innovations. However, the meme coins we will explore do not offer the same type of utility. Now seems like a good time to cash out while their valuations are up. Shiba Inu (SHIB-USD) starts our discussion on meme coins to sell, as the gap between market speculation and genuine utility forces investors to take notice.  The meme currency was initially created as a joke in August 2020, and even with its $15 billion market valuation, it is still mostly just a joke with almost no real-world utility. A lack of use cases is its ultimate downfall, both as an investment and as a project. Shiba Inu’s only ally is celebrity hype, chiefly Elon Musk, the CEO of SpaceX and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). And, Musk has a history of openly supporting meme coins. His logic is that meme coins are for the little guy. However, many fans of Shiba Inu realize that beyond trading, both ETH and BTC offer something to the investor, whether as a store of value or a platform for decentralized applications. That is the problem Shiba Inu needs to solve; otherwise, it will remain one of the meme coins to sell for the foreseeable future. Dogecoin (DOGE-USD) follows in the footsteps of Shiba Inu, as there is more similarities than differences between the two. It started out life as a lighthearted joke in December 2013. Two software engineers wanted to offer satire on the wild speculation of the crypto markets. Unfortunately, the two caused more inadvertent speculation in the crypto sphere when the meme coin caught on. Once again, thanks to Tesla CEO Elon Musk.  In March, Musk made hints that Tesla would accept the meme-based cryptocurrency as payment for its cars “at some point” during an event. Dogecoin is already accepted as payment for other Tesla merchandise purchases. Dogecoin saw a price spike when Musk dubbed it “the people’s crypto.” The title reaffirmed support at a time when faith in the coin was wavering. And, many in the investing community thought his endorsement was a thing of the past. Altogether, Dogecoin enthusiasts can use the meme coin for small tips and also fundraising activities. But they will have to wait for the next Musk X post or major announcement to move the needle in terms of price. And no one can accurately predict Elon Musk’s next move. Pepe (PEPE-USD) is another one of the meme coins to sell as we head into the Bitcoin halving cycle. With respect to utility, the coin has little to say; much of its value is speculation. Now, that’s not to say there is no market speculation from which to benefit. PEPE has experienced a lot of trading activity. Especially on Binance, accumulating millions of dollars worth of PEPE.  At the height of the meme coin frenzy, the PEPE token’s market cap soared to $500 million in 2023, doubling its value in a week’s time. However, PEPE let go of these gains later on in the year, as investors took profits, particularly in exchange for the more established Ethereum. In addition, Pepe has encountered issues that have eroded investor confidence. Such as insider trading, with the founders reportedly stealing around $15 million worth of tokens. Such occurrences cast doubt on the project’s openness and governance, providing more headaches for investors who already have to deal with a lack of utility.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips The Federal Reserve has signaled that it could implement up to three rate cuts this year, and the first one may come sooner than you think – possibly before the election in an attempt to give the economy a boost. In fact, if the government decides it needs to cut rates aggressively, we could even see all three cuts happen before the election. Historically, we’ve seen interest rates drop much faster than they rise, often due to unexpected “black swan” events that send markets downward. Regardless of how quickly it happens, it seems clear that rates are likely headed lower in the near future. It pays to identify stocks that stand to benefit most from rate cuts over the long run – stocks that could potentially deliver outstanding returns. I’ve got my eye on seven stocks in particular that I believe are primed for a rally if rates fall as expected. Let’s take a look! Carnival (NYSE:CCL) is a cruise company that had been suffering from malaise even before the pandemic struck. The pandemic was almost the nail in the coffin for the business, but ultra-low interest rates have kept it afloat and allowed it to weather the storm. Sadly, even with the travel boom following the pandemic, rising rates have been chipping away at all of Carnival’s profits. That’s why the stock still sits almost 70% off its February 2020 price. However, that could change soon once rates are cut. Carnival has solid top and bottom-line growth potential here. Analysts estimate the company’s earnings per share could skyrocket from just 98 cents currently to a whopping $5.30 over the next decade – that’s around 20% average annual growth from today’s depressed levels. The top line is also expected to grow from $24.5 billion to $35.4 billion in that same timeframe.  You’re paying just 16 times forward earnings for that sort of explosive growth profile. And that’s not even factoring in the likelihood that lower rates will probably help this heavily indebted company beat those expectations. A rate cut could be the catalyst that finally gets Carnival’s stock rebounding in a big way after years of underperformance. I see significant upside potential here if rates start to fall. American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) has faced basically an identical story, despite operating in a completely different airline business. However, both these travel/leisure companies have been sharing the same powerful tailwinds and harsh headwinds. Passenger traffic has surged strongly along with the pandemic recovery. But we’re seeing a lot of those profits being sucked dry due to high-interest expenses on debt. American has been paying around $500 million per quarter on average in interest expenses since Q2 2021. Yet even with that weighing it down, the company still managed to deliver a modest $19 million profit for Q4 2023. I believe AAL stock could really take off once rates start coming down. After all, you’re paying less than 6 times forward earnings for the shares right now. Analysts expect EPS to more than double over the next four years, along with mid-single-digit revenue growth. Those estimates could prove conservative if borrowing costs decline. American is cleaning up its balance sheet and is well-positioned for an era of cheaper financing costs. With the pandemic disruption largely in the rearview mirror, this could be an opportune time to load up on AAL before rate cuts catalyze the next big upswing for the stock. It’s a high-risk, high-reward play, but one I’m willing to make a bet on at today’s bargain valuations.  The top two telecom stocks, Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T) have been extremely frustrating investments for shareholders. Both started sliding well before the pandemic, and the pandemic only exacerbated their declines. However, this downtrend seems to have stabilized in the near term with both stocks edging upwards over recent months. I believe AT&T, in particular, has a lot more room for recovery going forward. Sure, the company has a hefty $161 billion debt load weighing it down. But AT&T is still managing to keep profits in the green while also yielding a hefty 6.3% dividend to investors at the same time. I think rate cuts would supercharge those profits, along with the subsidies that are already rolling into companies developing 5G and other communications infrastructure. Analysts don’t expect flashy growth here, but the high dividends make it worthwhile to hold and reinvest in the stock until a sustained recovery rally takes hold. And there’s a decent chance that the rally could be catalyzed by lower interest rates. Let’s face it – AT&T’s balance sheet is bloated, but the core business is still churning out cash flow. A decline in borrowing costs would provide immediate earnings accretion by reducing interest expenses. It would also increase the company’s financial flexibility to pay down debt more quickly. I’m not calling for AT&T to be the next big multi-bagger. But for income investors, it could be an appealing way to collect juicy dividends while waiting for the next upswing, which could arrive courtesy of the Fed cutting rates. That upside potential, combined with the income stream, makes T shares worth a look at current levels.  Newell Brands (NASDAQ:NWL) is another beaten-down stock that’s trading at bargain-basement prices and is likely about to make a U-turn from here. This is another company that’s been adversely impacted by rate hikes and supply chain problems. It sells a range of consumer products, but I wouldn’t consider most of its offerings as essential purchases for customers. As a result, rate hikes have really stung this discretionary company, and the stock chart does not look pretty. Regardless, it looks like an excellent opportunity if you’re a bargain hunter looking for rebound plays. Newell makes enough money to tread water for years with huge room for upside once rates are cut. The stock is currently trading below its Great Recession lows despite the fact that the company has actually been buying back shares and now yields 3.7% on the dividend. Gurufocus puts the fair value of NWL stock at around $15 per share based on its model – nearly double the current $7.7 share price. I see this as a classic “everything that can go wrong, has gone wrong” situation where the bad news is more than priced in. As the economy rebounds and rates start falling, Newell could deliver significant upside from today’s fire-sale prices. It’s a contrarian value play, but one I’m willing to make given the potential rewards if I’m right. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has also been among the hardest-hit companies due to rising interest rates. However, unlike most stocks on this list, Tesla wasn’t adversely impacted because of high debt levels. Tesla’s vehicles are very expensive purchases, and most buyers finance them with loans and mortgages. Higher interest rates have discouraged people from making big-ticket purchases that require paying lenders hefty sums in interest over time.  As a result, demand for Teslas has cratered significantly amid the rate hike cycle. Not only that, but we’re also seeing softer demand as oil prices have come down from their crazy 2022 highs, reducing the incentive to buy an electric vehicle in the first place. I still think Tesla is a buy at this level and can deliver stellar long-term returns from here. Future rate cuts could re-ignite demand for its vehicles considerably. The stock has priced in a lot of volatility, risk, and recent earnings misses already. Expectations are low now, and I believe Tesla will likely exceed them over the coming years despite near-term risks. Let’s not forget – Tesla is still the only viable, mass-market electric vehicle company in the Western hemisphere. Every other EV startup has been an unprofitable cash pit so far. 3M (NYSE:MMM) has been another big loser even in this bull market. However, I believe the stock has declined too much to a very strong historical support level of around $90 per share. The stock is now even cheaper than it was during the 2007! Of course, 3M has been mired in controversy over litigation risks, and the general Wall Street outlook has been bearish for many months. However, the tide may be shifting. Most of the bad news already seems priced into the stock at this point.  Moreover, 3M just delivered blowout Q4 results with revenue surprising estimates by 3.7% and earnings per share beating expectations by 4.6%. This is usually a sign that Wall Street has gone overboard with its pessimism and that company execution is better than expected. I believe buying at these bargain-basement levels is a good idea, and analyst sentiment is shifting fast. 3M does have a sizable $17 billion debt load, but it’s small enough to handle. The company also pays a juicy 6.5% dividend yield and still delivered $945 million in net income last quarter. With the stock trading at just 11x forward earnings, holding shares until a recovery takes hold seems like a worthwhile endeavor – especially if rate cuts provide an added tailwind. 3M has been around for over 122 years and has weathered many storms before. I’m betting the company’s best days still lie ahead once the current headwinds subside. LendingTree (NASDAQ:TREE) is a more under-the-radar stock that many investors may have overlooked. While many of the other names on this list are multi-billion-dollar behemoths, this online lending marketplace has a market cap of just $540 million as I write. The stock has already recovered nearly 300% off its lows, and I believe the sharp uptrend could continue going forward. As I’ve said, borrowing and lending activity will likely pick up strongly after interest rates are cut. LendingTree could be one of the biggest beneficiaries of that environment.  We’ve seen big gains already, so this is definitely one of the higher-risk, higher-reward bets on this list. But the stock remains down over 90% from its prior peak. I believe LendingTree’s earnings per share could potentially double over the next four years as the credit cycle turns and loan demand improves. The company also has a debt load slightly larger than its market cap at present. Any reduction in interest expenses on that debt would provide an immediate boost to profitability. LendingTree is an asset-light, high operating leverage business, so any increase in revenue should really flow through to the bottom line. There are certainly risks here given the company’s struggles and high debt levels. But for the speculative investor with a longer time horizon, TREE stock could offer massive upside if management can get the business back on track amid lower rates.

      "Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) has emerged as a key player in the semiconductor industry poised for significant growth, particularly with Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), the parent company of Facebook, stepping into the spotlight as its next multi-billion-dollar AI ASIC partner. With a focus on cutting-edge technology and strategic partnerships, Broadcom’s trajectory toward expansion and market dominance is becoming increasingly apparent. Analysts are busy reviewing the stock for any direction as to future trajectory. JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur shed light on Broadcom’s promising trajectory, particularly with Meta emerging as the “next multi-billion dollar per year AI ASIC customer.” With an Overweight rating and a price target of $1,700 by December 2024, Broadcom is poised for substantial gains. Also Read: AI Expansion Fuels Broadcom Surge: Stock Chart Signals Further Upside Broadcom has been successful in capturing next-gen 3nm AI ASIC chip wins at both Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) dba Google and Meta. These wins are expected to significantly contribute to Broadcom’s revenues, with projections indicating Meta becoming the next “multi-billion-dollar customer” for Broadcom’s AI ASIC solutions.  Over the past five years, Broadcom has established itself as a leader in custom chip (ASIC) development, particularly in collaboration with tech giants like Google and Meta. These partnerships have driven Broadcom’s AI ASIC revenues to over $9 billion this year, up from $3.5 billion last year. According to Sur, Broadcom is on track to release its 3nm AI accelerator (TPU) custom chip programs with Google (TPU v6) and Meta (MTIA TPU) by mid-2024. The ramp-up in production is expected to occur in the second half of the year and continue through 2025 “Overall we estimate that Google and Meta combined will drive $9B+ in AI ASIC chip revenues for Broadcom this year, (Google ~$8B+ and Meta around $500M-$1B), up almost 2.5x over CY23,” the analyst wrote. Sur also drew attention to the fact that Broadcom has “won follow-on/next-gen 3nm AI TPU ASIC wins at both customers targeted for tape-out in CY25 with ramp in back-half 25 and into CY26.” Broadcom’s advancements in its 2nm ASIC platform further support this sustained growth in AI ASIC revenues, with the platform already securing its first win with a high-performance computing customer.  The company anticipates achieving total AI semiconductor shipments of $10-$12 billion this year, driven by the expected increase in demand from its third AI ASIC customer, likely Bytedance/TikTok, and strong market interest in Broadcom’s Tomahawk 5 and Jericho 3 switching/routing chipsets, as well as its PCIe Gen5/Gen6 switching solutions. This projection signifies a growth of 2.5X compared to the figures recorded in 2023. Overall, Broadcom’s ASIC design win and revenue pipeline remain robust, bolstered by strong AI-driven demand in the networking semiconductor market. With anticipated positive revenue and EPS revisions throughout the year, Broadcom positions itself for continued success and growth in the AI semiconductor industry. AVGO Price Action: Shares of Broadcom were down 0.25% to $1336.10 on Monday.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips If you’re on the lookout for stocks to buy before the next bull market, look no further. Searching the market for stocks that have the potential to rise sharply requires positive market approaches. Market observers are paying close attention to three contenders who stand out. Each makes a distinct argument supported by cunning business moves and cutting-edge technology. To begin with, the first is causing a stir with its grand ambitions for computing infrastructure growth. The corporation is putting itself at the forefront of the emerging metaverse revolution by bolstering its artificial intelligence (AI) research skills. However, the second one is out to restore its position as the semiconductor industry leader. The business prioritizes product variety, transistor performance, and AI. Similarly, the third one’s data center income has increased astoundingly. The third unquestionably dominates this market because of the growing need for AI and rapid computing solutions. Furthermore, it offers previously unheard-of development prospects because of its deliberate worldwide expansion and the growing need for sovereign AI in areas outside of the U.S. and China. Therefore, these three businesses present an opportunity to ride the AI innovation wave, symbolizing the fusion of state-of-the-art technology.  By the end of the year, Meta (NASDAQ:META) expects to have around 600,000 H100 equivalents of compute and about 350,000 H100s in compute infrastructure and AI research. The organization strongly emphasizes investments in cutting-edge computational infrastructure to support AI developments. On the other hand, Meta takes an open-source stance, supporting industry innovation while maintaining proprietary product implementations. The organization’s open-source projects, which include PyTorch development and Llama models, attract top talent. However, robust sales of Quest 3 helped Reality Labs’ revenue exceed $1.1 billion in Q4 2023. To fulfill its vision of the metaverse, Meta keeps making significant investments in AR, VR, and MR technologies. Goods like the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses are well received and support Meta’s expansion plans. Finally, with its investments in cutting-edge technologies, including AI, virtual and augmented reality, and the metaverse, Meta is positioned to lead the industry in innovation. In summary, Meta is committed to delivering transformational experiences to its consumers and growing its AI capabilities, as seen by its major concentration on computing infrastructure. The chip giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) can restore its leadership in transistor and power performance by 2025 and achieve five nodes in four years. Intel 3, the company’s first advanced node, demonstrated steady yield growth and performance.  Moreover, Intel Foundry Services (IFS) made significant strides, securing meaningful collaborations and design accolades. Intel is becoming a major player in the foundry business, with over 75 ecosystem and customer test chips put out and over 50 in the works. With strategic changes like merging its Graphics Group and Accelerated Computing Systems, Intel hopes to expand into new sectors like AI, networking, and automotive and diversify its product line. For instance, products like the Intel Core Ultra CPUs and Intel Xeon Scalable processors are targeted for AI workloads. With that, Intel has made significant strides in developing AI sectors like edge devices and AI computing. Lastly, with its continuous worldwide manufacturing presence, Intel offers reliable access to capacity in all key locations. Hence, the company is on track with its growth initiatives, guaranteeing an adequate supply to keep up with the increasing demand. The $47.5 billion data center revenue predicted for Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) in 2023 is a vital milestone. This shows the segment’s explosive growth and contribution to total business revenue. The data center category has demonstrated robust performance and market dominance, with revenue more than doubled from the previous year. Additionally, the demand for accelerated computing, AI training and inference, data processing, and CUDA-accelerated workloads across several sectors has significantly increased data center revenue. Certainly, all areas had robust revenue growth for Nvidia’s data centers, except China, since U.S. export control laws caused a sharp fall in revenue. Despite this fall, Nvidia has been distributing substitutes that don’t need a license for the Chinese market.  Likewise, another factor driving demand is the need for sovereign AI. Nations are investing in AI infrastructure to support their industry ecosystems and research. These regions are not only the U.S. and China. In short, Nvidia has substantial growth potential and a large market due to its strong presence outside the U.S. and China and the rising need for AI infrastructure and solutions.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips After a big run to start the year, Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock looks to have stalled. But don’t worry. It likely won’t be long before the rally in the chipmaker continues. In the last month, NVDA stock has dipped 5%. The stock has struggled to rise above $950 per share and has retreated each time it hits that level. However, the current pullback comes after Nvidia had a huge run in January and February. Year to date, the stock is up 83% and a leader in the S&P 500 index. The current dip is likely only a temporary breather before NVDA stock again runs flat out. As such, investors would be smart to buy the dip. The rally in Nvidia’s stock that began in earnest at the start of 2023 has pushed the company to some important milestones. Earlier this year, Nvidia’s market capitalization crossed the $2 trillion mark and it is now the third largest publicly traded company in the world after Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). The company’s influence on the market is growing and the main catalyst for NVDA stock continues to be the company’s earnings. Since last summer, the stock market literally pauses in the days ahead of Nvidia’s earnings reports. It’s as if investors and traders are holding their collective breath to see if the company can exceed the lofty expectations that have been set for it. So far, Nvidia hasn’t disappointed and the entire market rallies after the company beats Wall Street’s forecasts. In February, Nvidia reported earnings that covered the final quarter of 2023 that crushed expectations and showed mind boggling growth at the microchip and semiconductor maker.  Fueled by unrelenting demand for its microchips and semiconductors among artificial intelligence (AI) companies around the world, Nvidia reported that its Q4 2023 sales rose 265% year over year, while its profits grew 769% from a year earlier. All metrics topped analysts’ estimates, and the guidance provided was even better. For the just completed first quarter of the year, Nvidia has forecast sales of $24 billion. If achieved, that would be up 234% from sales of $7.19 billion a year earlier. Can Nvidia do it again? There’s no reason to doubt the company at this point. The big question concerning Nvidia on Wall Street is how long can the company continue to exceed the sky high expectations that have been set for it? After all, the comparables the company faces are only getting tougher. At some point, Nvidia will fail to jump the bar that’s been set for its earnings and the stock will crash, right? Maybe not. Nvidia is continuing to pull out all the stops to stay ahead of its competitors and ensure that its earnings run at a blistering pace. In March, Nvidia unveiled its next generation AI microchips at a developer conference. Called the Blackwell series, the first of these new chips, the GB200, is the company’s most powerful technology to date. Specifically, the new GB200 chip includes what Nvidia calls a “transformer engine” that’s designed to run transformer based AI, one of the core technologies underpinning chatbots such as GPT-4. Nvidia is already receiving huge pre-orders from companies such as Microsoft and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). At the same time, Nvidia has signalled its intention to become less of a microchip provider and more of a platform provider going forward. To that end, the company introduced new revenue-generating software called Nvidia Inference Microservice (NIM) that it will charge a subscription fee for enterprise customers to access. And, Nvidia continues to expand globally, recently announcing plans to build a $200 million AI center in Indonesia as it grows throughout Asia. Nvidia currently controls about three-quarters (75%) of the AI chip market worldwide. That dominance shows no signs of decreasing. If anything, Nvidia’s market share is likely to increase as it begins to deliver its Blackwell series of microchips later this year. While the company’s earnings and stock have produced blockbuster gains over the last 18 months, there’s every reason to believe that the growth will continue. The bottom line is that Nvidia has the expertise and the products to remain the foundation of the AI revolution. For this reason, NVDA stock is a buy.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Blue-chip stocks offer more stability than most stocks. Corporations in this category are profitable, and some of them are still growing at good rates. While the year started off strong, March was a bit slower. The S&P 500 only gained 3% during the month while it gained 5% in February. An April upswing can move blue-chip stocks higher. It’s nice to see stocks move higher in one month, but investors should prioritize what a stock will look like after a few years. These blue-chip stocks exhibit promising signs that indicate they have more room for long-term gains. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has a steady record of outperforming the stock market and delivering gains for shareholders. The stock is up by 252% over the past five years and offers a 0.71% dividend yield.  The company’s dominance in cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and other industries has prompted many analysts to feel bullish about the stock’s long-term prospects. The average price target suggests an 11% upside. Microsoft is also rated as a “Strong Buy” among 35 analysts. The highest price target of $550 per share implies a 29% gain from current levels. Microsoft Azure continues to gain market share in the cloud computing industry. This major catalyst grew by 24% year-over-year in Q2 FY24 and contributed to more than half of Microsoft’s total revenue. Cloud computing has also helped Microsoft expand its profit margins. That has led to a lower P/E ratio and high dividend hikes each year. The rising demand of artificial intelligence should increase Microsoft Cloud’s runway. American Express (NYSE:AXP) is an enticing dividend growth stock thanks to its valuation, consistent financial growth, and high-profit margins. The stock has a 20 P/E ratio and a 1.26% dividend yield. American Express recently announced a 17% dividend hike amid good financial results in the fourth quarter of 2023. During that quarter, revenue increased by 11% year-over-year while net income jumped by 23% year-over-year. American Express also announced that it intends on generating 9% to 11% year-over-year revenue growth beyond 2026. The company also expects EPS growth rates to range in the mid-teens during the same time. These announcements are a part of the company’s growth plan which started in January 2022. American Express generated record revenue and profits in 2023 by adding 12.2 million new cards over the past year. The number of “cards-in-force” issued exceeds 140 million. People will use their credit and debit cards during any economic cycle. American Express offers more insulation than many corporations when the economy slows down.  Deckers Outdoor (NYSE:DECK) is an emerging athletic apparel brand that is stealing market share from top competitors. The company’s Hoka and Ugg brands have been a big hit with consumers. Revenue increased by 16% year-over-year in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 to reach a record $1.56 billion. The company’s fiscal 2024 revenue guidance suggests it will generate 14% more sales in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023. The company’s profits grew by 40% year-over-year and helped Deckers Outdoor secure a 25% net profit margin. Ugg has been doing most of the work and reached $1.072 billion in revenue during the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Hola came in second with $429.3 million in revenue but is growing at a faster rate. Ugg brand net sales increased by 15.2% year-over-year while Hoka brand net sales grew by 21.9% year-over-year. Deckers Outdoor has received more attention ever since it was added to the S&P 500. Even before its inclusion, the stock has comfortably outperformed the market by delivering a 480% gain over the past five years. Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) sells essential home care and grooming products that won’t go out of style during an economic bust. The stock has only delivered a 49% gain over the past five years which is below the S&P 500’s gains during the same time period. However, this blue-chip stock doesn’t experience as much volatility. PG stock only has a 0.43 beta compared to the S&P 500’s 1.00 beta. Beta is a measure of an investment’s volatility. While many growth investors want to forget 2022, Procter & Gamble only lost 7% of its value during that year. The company’s 2.41% dividend yield helped to offset some of those losses.  Speaking of the dividend, it’s one of the most reliable payouts in the market. Procter & Gamble has distributed dividends for 133 consecutive years. The includes 67 consecutive years of dividend hikes. Procter & Gamble has the flexibility to raise prices during inflation and reward long-term investors. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a dominant force in the e-commerce industry. Amazon’s vast logistics network makes it easy for most people to receive any product within 1-2 days. The tech giant also has same-day shipping available at some locations. The company has a deep moat for its online marketplace, and that competitive advantage resulted in record revenue in Q4 2023. Amazon increased its net sales by 14% year-over-year to reach $170.0 billion. Amazon grew its international revenue by 17% year-over-year while revenue from North America was up by 13% year-over-year. Amazon also has a competitive moat with its cloud computing platform. Amazon Web Services exhibited a 13% year-over-year growth rate to reach $24.2 billion. The company is also expanding into advertising, video streaming, and artificial intelligence. These growth opportunities can result in higher revenue growth and rising profit margins. This makes it one of those blue-chip stocks to buy. Amazon stock is up by 23% year-to-date and has plenty of fans on Wall Street. The average price target suggests a 13% upside. The stock is rated as a “Strong Buy” among 41 analysts.  Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is another blue-chip stock to consider after the social media giant has rented its focus on rising profit margins. Analysts have cheered on the company’s recent results and currently view the company as a “Strong Buy.” The highest price target of $609 per share suggests a 16% upside from the current price. The stock has been getting more attention due to its recent dividend. Meta Platforms announced its first dividend in the fourth quarter of 2023. The company also reported 25% year-over-year revenue growth and 201% year-over-year net income growth in that quarter. The dividend was the icing on the cake. Many advertisers flock to Meta Platforms to reach more of their potential customers. The company has a comfortable lead over other social networks. A TikTok ban would push Meta Platforms higher up on its pedestal. Meta Platforms doesn’t need a controversial TikTok ban to gain market share, but it is a catalysts that investors should monitor. Visa (NYSE:V) offers stability since many people will use credit and debit cards during various economic cycles. These plastic cards are more convenient than carrying around spare change and can also help with credit building (credit cards only) and have enticing rewards programs. You aren’t earning 2% cashback if you use paper cash for your purchases, and credit cards let you access money that you currently don’t have. These financial products can put you into a lot of debt, but they are useful for many people.  Visa has been using this formula to deliver impressive returns for shareholders. The stock has gained 7% year-to-date and is up by 74% over the past five years. Visa also has a 0.75% dividend yield and has a compounded annual growth rate of 18.18% over the past five years. The stock only has a 21.50% dividend payout ratio, which suggests it has plenty of room to increase its distributions. The fintech company also boasts solid financials. Visa reported 9% year-over-year revenue growth and 17% year-over-year GAAP net income growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. It’s one of those blue-chip stocks to consider.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips The Magnificent 7 stocks were in a league just over a year ago. Nowadays, the group has fallen through, with many folks narrowing down the exclusive basket to six, now five or four. At this pace, we may be left with just one Magnificent stock standing as Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) continues its epic rally on the back of the AI boom. Let’s not be so quick to give up on the companies within the group that have lost their way. Long-term investors should be willing to give them at least a few years (let’s say three) to let them pick up traction again. Remember, we should not look to the past year of magnificence when picking individual names from the cohort. Instead, we should look to the stocks we think could be most magnificent over the next year or two, regardless of how they’ve fared in the past quarter or year. Here are three that I think are equipped for a magnificent rest of 2024. Meta Platforms is showing no signs of losing its luster. The stock has added more than 52% in year-to-date gains to its impressive past-year surge. Even at new highs of $527 and change, I still find META stock incredibly cheap relative to its AI- and metaverse-powered growth prospects.  At writing, shares of Meta Platforms trade at 26.3 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E), not fitting my definition of an expensive stock, especially for a firm leveraging generative AI more effectively than most in its industry. Looking ahead, AI could easily continue paving the way for new highs. As more people purchase their first virtual reality headsets, perhaps Meta’s metaverse may begin to be seen as a source of strength rather than an expense builder. In any case, I wouldn’t give up on the stock here. It’s still cheap at new highs, in my books. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the Magnificent Seven companies that some critics may think should be removed from the group. I’m not one of them. The company is still innovating, perhaps at a much faster pace than investors believe. As Apple Vision Pro launches into new markets later this year, while the firm looks to finally reveal some of the finer details of its AI ambitions, perhaps it’s too soon to shed your portfolio of AAPL stock. A recent Bloomberg report suggested that Apple is looking into creating home robots after ditching its Apple Car plans. That’s an intriguing report, but not everybody’s convinced by the potential of robots to fuel growth for the tech giant. Dan Ives of Wedbush stated such a move would be a “black eye moment” for Apple. Harsh words. But I think he’s right in that Apple should be emphasizing AI more than experimenting with new hardware concepts.  Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock was the first out of the Magnificent Seven group. But whether it can work its way back in is another question entirely. I think it can, especially as Elon Musk looks to prove to the world that Tesla is not just an automobile company but a tech company on the cusp of disrupting big markets with its innovations. Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood is a Tesla believer, having picked up TSLA stock numerous times in recent months. A robotaxi event scheduled for August 8 will be a pivotal moment for Musk and the future of his electric vehicle (EV) empire as it looks to reverse course after a horrid past two years. Now down 60%, I have to say shares seem a tad too oversold, especially for those who believe that Tesla has a front-row seat to the full self-driving revolution. In short, Tesla isn’t magnificent right now. But come August, I think it could prove its doubters wrong. On the date of publication, Joey Frenette owned shares of Apple.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips At the start of last month, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) hit $500 per share, a major share price milestone. Meta Platforms stock is trending higher but its price performance is relatively muted. We disagree. This “Magnificent Seven” component could reach $750 per share sooner than expected. Obviously, Meta Platforms’ AI catalyst has a lot to do with this. Yet while gen AI is poised to remain a key catalyst, don’t forget that other factors are in play, including one that may surprise you, that could really move the needle. Recently, we’ve talked about how “AI mania” is cooling down among some of META’s “Mag 7” peers. Investors have become more uncertain about the pace of future growth and valuation sustainability. Macro-related uncertainties, such as those regarding interest rates, are also weighing on even the highest-quality of AI stocks.  But while this trend may affect the performance of some artificial intelligence winners in the immediate term, it’s not a slam dunk. This will be the case for Meta Platforms stock. A big reason for this is the fact that, arguably, META’s AI potential has yet to be fully priced into shares. Yes, the gen AI growth trend has started to positively impact Meta’s operating performance. It’s also of course been a key factor in sending META up fourfold since early 2023. However, as InvestorPlace’s Thomas Niel recently argued, the market continues to see AI only as something that will enhance Meta’s digital advertising-focused revenue model. As Niel sees it, Meta’s continued efforts with its in-house large language model, Llama, could pave the way for the company to diversify into subscription-based software sales. A further move into this area could drive a continued re-rating for the stock. Let’s say the “AI re-rating” catalyst plays out soon for Meta Platforms stock. How far could shares climb from this factor alone? At present, META trades for 25.7 times estimated 2024 earnings of around $20 per share.  Subscription software-focused AI stocks may sport mid-30s forward multiples, but we believe that, at best, this catalyst would result only in a partial re-rating. Say, a move to exactly 30 times forward earnings. This would mean a move for META from above $500, to around $600 per share. That’s not quite $750 per share, but don’t worry. There’s more in play that could help this stock reach such heights. For one, thanks to both organic growth, plus the impact of the company’s “year of efficiency” efforts, earnings are expected to grow by nearly 16% in 2025. Further indication Meta Platforms will meet this estimate, or better yet, beat it, could propel the stock towards the $700 per share. If that’s not promising enough, there’s something else that could get the stock over the $750 per share mark within a year. Ironically, it all has to do with walking away from what led to this company’s 2021 name change. As Barron’s commentator Eric J. Savitz recently opined, META has rallied for many reasons. Besides AI efforts and “year of efficiency” success, factors like Meta’s growing commitment to return-of-capital efforts like dividends and share repurchases have also played a role.  In Savitz’s view, the company may have yet another needle-moving ace in the hole. That would be hitting the brakes on its continued big bet on the metaverse. Despite talk of Meta pulling back on metaverse investments, annual losses from its Reality Labs segment remain high, at $16.1 billion. If Meta decides to truly “walk back” this big wager, the investing public would likely react bullishly to such a move. Given there’s so much that could send Meta Platforms stock 50% higher from here, it’s still prime time to buy. Feel free to enter/add to a position. META stock earns an A rating in Portfolio Grader.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips While virtual reality has long been tied to the entertainment arena, the innovation has expanded in utility, making these strong buy VR stocks exceptionally compelling. At the end of the day, it comes down to the numbers. According to Mordor Intelligence, the VR market size is projected to reach a valuation of $67.66 billion in 2024. By 2029, experts believe that this segment could rise to $204.35 billion. If so, we’re talking about a compound annual growth rate of 24.74%. As the research firm pointed out, VR can be used for applications that go beyond video games. Teachers can provide immersive learning experiences while companies – especially those tied to critical industries – can train their workers in a safe, pressure-free environment. With myriad relevancies available, these are the strong buy VR stocks to consider. When it comes to immersive technologies, you can’t leave out Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). First, the company enjoys natural synergies through its data goldmine Facebook. As for direct relevance to strong buy VR stocks to consider, Meta has invested heavily in both the hardware and software components necessary to fully participate in the metaverse.  True to the theme of this article, Wall Street analysts rate META stock as a consensus strong buy. Among 43 experts, 40 of them rate shares a buy. It’s interesting, though, that two experts rate META a hold and one a sell. Overall, the average price target lands at $530.58, with the high-side estimate reaching $609. In fiscal 2023, the tech giant beat all its quarterly expectations for earnings per share. Its average earnings surprise came out to 9.78%. For the current fiscal year, experts are looking for EPS of $20 on revenue of $158.24 billion. These stats are well above last year’s print of $14.87 EPS on sales of $134.9 billion. Operating under the internet content and information subcategory, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) offers various products and platforms across the world. Per its public profile, the enterprise operates through Google Services, Google Cloud and Other Bets segments. It enjoys the advantage of effectively owning the Internet through its Google search engine. However, it’s very much one of the strong buy VR stocks to consider. To be clear, Alphabet is more geared toward the augmented reality side of the picture. Nevertheless, the key similarity between VR and AR is the leveraging of digitalization to improve experiences and/or productivity. Further, the global AR market itself could become an industry worth nearly $600 billion by 2030 It’s no surprise, then, that analysts rate GOOGL a consensus strong buy. Among 37 experts, 29 rate shares a buy while the rest say it’s a hold. Overall, the average price target land sat $165.28, with the high side hitting $180.  For fiscal 2024, analysts are looking for EPS of $6.81 on revenue of $342.31 billion. These are notable improvements over earnings of $5.80 a share on sales of $307.39 billion last year. Conducting business mostly in the realm of infrastructure software, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) really needs no introduction. One of the advantages that the company levers is that its business software is practically universal. If you want to get anything done – especially if need to collaborate with others – it’s almost essential to be fluent with Microsoft’s Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) offerings. Regarding its status as one of the strong buy VR stocks to consider, Microsoft has invested in its HoloLens mixed reality technology. What I appreciate about this innovation is that it has wide-ranging implications. In particular, companies in various critical industries can help train new employees in intensive functions. This way, learning is accelerated and if mistakes are made, employees can quickly learn from them. Overall, 33 out of 35 analysts rate MSFT a buy. The two contrarians are one hold and one sell. Moreover, the average price target comes in at $473.77. Notably, the high-side target calls for a per-share price of $550, implying nearly 32% growth potential. For fiscal 2024, analysts are seeking EPS of $11.65 on revenue of $244.22 billion. That’s up conspicuously from last year’s $9.81 EPS on sales of $211.91 billion.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Laying a strong financial foundation early in life is crucial when choosing stocks for young investors. Taking advantage of the power of compounding allows even modest investments to grow significantly over extended periods. In other words, small, regular contributions can snowball into a significant nest egg over time. The historical performance of the S&P 500 index, averaging around a 10% annual return with dividends reinvested, exemplifies the wealth-creation potential of equities. Thus, the key is to invest wisely, choosing assets, especially robust stocks, with the potential for long-term growth. However, sifting through many stocks and navigating the world of ETFs can feel overwhelming. This article simplifies some of the processes, especially for young readers. Today, we’ll explore three stocks for young investors to build wealth steadily in the years ahead. Known for its unparalleled long-term track record, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) is led by the legendary investor Warren Buffett. Investors eagerly follow Berkshire Hathaway’s annual shareholder meetings, where Buffett and colleagues share sage wisdom. Over the past six decades, Berkshire Hathaway stock has appreciated at an impressive 20% compound annual growth rate, outperforming the S&P 500 by a wide margin. The power of compounding has resulted in remarkable returns for shareholders, making it a compelling choice among our stocks for young investors.  Berkshire focuses on acquiring high-quality companies with strong competitive advantages and strong balance sheets. Management released the fourth quarter and full 2023 results in late February. Net earnings came in at $17.36 per share compared with $8.24 for the same period 12 months ago. Moreover, full-year earnings per share (“EPS) for 2023 was $44.27 versus a loss of $10.33 for 2022. In addition to a jump in operating earnings, the company’s cash holding surged to record levels. So far in 2024, BRK-B stock has advanced 16%, changing hands at 21.9 times forward earnings. Meanwhile, BRK-B’s 12-month median price forecast stands at $453.61, giving an upside potential of 9% from current levels. For young investors, owning a piece of Berkshire Hathaway can be a smart move toward building long-term wealth. Leading e-commerce platform provider Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) is next among our stocks for young investors. The company benefits significantly from the sustained shift towards online shopping worldwide. Fourth quarter revenue grew 24% year-over-year (YOY) to $2.14 billion, translating to even stronger 30% growth after adjusting for the sales of its logistics businesses. Adjusted EPS also surged, reaching $0.34 compared to $0.07 in the prior-year quarter. Free cash flow more than quadrupled YOY as the company moved deeper into positive cash flow territory. E-commerce is projected to continue strong growth in the coming years, while Shopify sits at the heart of this trend, providing merchants with an all-in-one platform. Given its expanding margins, loyal customer base and commitment to innovation, analysts forecast a 35% revenue growth in 2024.  Yet, SHOP stock has lost 4% year-to-date (YTD), offering a better entry point for new investors. However, we should note that shares still command a premium at 14x trailing sales. Meanwhile, Wall Street’s 12-month price target of $85.00 suggests a potential upside of around 14% from current levels. While Shopify’s stock price will likely be volatile the rest of the year, long-term investors could regard $70 as a better entry point. As one of the most actively traded ETFs globally, the SPDR S&P 500  ETF (NYSEARCA:SPY) is the final name on our list of stocks for young investors. The SPY fund tracks the performance of the benchmark S&P 500 index, which measures the stock performance of the largest publicly-traded 500 companies stateside that make up around 80% of the overall U.S. stock market’s value. SPY offers broad exposure to these U.S. businesses’ growth and profitability potential, mitigating single-stock concentration risk. Due to its capitalization-weighted structure, large, well-established firms hold a substantial weighting within the index, influencing their overall performance. Launched in 1993 as the first US-listed ETF, SPY holds over $530 billion in assets. The five largest names in SPY include  Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), accounting for a quarter of the fund’s roster. SPY has gained 8% YTD, while the fund’s top 10 holdings have significantly outperformed the broader market. Yet, the current valuation appears slightly expensive, with trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-book (P/B) ratios of 22.0 and 4.5, respectively. A potential decline towards $500 or below during the upcoming earnings season would mean a more opportune entry point for long-term investors.

      "Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) saw its shares surge to a new all-time high of $530 per share on Thursday. This upward movement was driven by positive sentiment following Jefferies’ reiteration of a Buy rating and an increase in the price target from $550 to $585. Over the recent past, Meta Platforms’ stock performance has been impressive, with shares recording a 137.95% increase over the past year and a 44.34% gain year-to-date. Related: What’s Going On With Facebook Parent Meta Platforms’ Stock? Despite hitting an all-time high, Meta’s stock maintains a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 25.57, positioning it among of the lowest ratios among its Magnificent Seven peers. Notably, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) dba Google‘s P/E ratio stands at 22.37, while the rest are above Meta’s valuation. Moreover, recent analyst ratings from Jefferies, Wells Fargo, and Roth MKM on April 4, April 3, and March 18, suggest an average price target of $561.67 for Meta stock, indicating a potential upside of 9.30% from current price levels.  From a technical standpoint, Meta stock exhibits a strongly bullish trend. The stock is trading above its 5, 20, and 50-day exponential moving averages, signaling positive momentum. Additionally, Meta stock’s moving averages and other technical indicators such as Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) and Bollinger Bands suggest a bullish sentiment. However, Meta Platforms’ Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 63.22 indicates that it’s nearing overbought conditions, which investors should consider. Despite this, the overall bullish momentum and positive analyst sentiment position Meta as a potentially attractive investment opportunity amid the company’s continuous innovation and growth in the digital landscape.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) stock is a hot topic among traders on Friday after the social media company hit a new all-time high this morning. META stock is trading for roughly $527.88 per share as of this writing. This sets a new all-time high for the stock. Investors will note that Meta Platforms’ shares have been on a recent uptick before this new record. Looking back at the stock’s history, Meta hit a rough period in 2022. That came alongside decreased use after lockdowns, rising inflation and increased interest rates. All of this was weighing on the shares. However, the company spent much of 2023 regaining lost ground. While it did see a slight slump late last year, it didn’t take long for the Facebook parent company to come out of it.  The latest news helping out shares of META stock comes from analysts. Jefferies increased its price target from $550 per share to $585 while RBC Capital increased its from $565 per share to $600. Jefferies analysts were incredibly positive on Meta Platforms in a note to clients.

      "Wedbush's Dan Ives thinks that a culmination of the AI revolution and improving ad spending will make the March quarter \"one to watch\" for companies in the technology sector. What Happened: Ives expressed optimism about the prospects of big technology companies in the March 2024 quarter. \"I think it's going to be one for the ages in terms of digital advertising,\" Ives explained, underscoring that Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google is his top pick for this reason. Ives thinks that the spending environment in the tech industry is improving. This will help us see the next part of the \"AI revolution,\" according to Ives. \"Big Tech earnings should be robust for 1Q and an important moment to put fuel into this tech rally with earnings/growth moving higher,\" Ives said in an interview with CNBC.  Subscribe to the Benzinga Tech Trends newsletter to get all the latest tech developments delivered to your inbox. Ives has been consistent in his belief that the next phase of the AI revolution is the demand of AI and cloud computing. After Oracle Corp.'s (NYSE:ORCL) fiscal third-quarter earnings, Ives underscored that its \"hypergrowth\" in AI is the \"big clue\" of the AI revolution puzzle. Now, based on Wedbush's surveys, Ives thinks that the growth here is \"much stronger than expected\" when it comes to advertising, which will help boost Google's revenues. See Also: Mark Cuban Dispels Rumors About AI Bubble, Comparing It To Dot-Com Era ‘Frothiness’: ‘There Were…Companies With Just A Website And Going Public’  \"We think Google here could ultimately have a $30-$40 upside on digital advertising as well as what we’re seeing on the cloud side.\" Ives is also optimistic about Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) on the AI and cloud fronts, and Mark Zuckerberg-led Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is also on his radar. Big Tech earnings should be robust for 1Q and an important moment to put fuel into this tech rally with earnings/growth moving higher @LastCallCNBC https://t.co/m941Mlpuhy Why It Matters: Ives' bullish outlook concerning Google is noteworthy after it struggled with its AI chatbot, Gemini. In March, Wedbush said in a note seen by Benzinga that the risks to Google Search from AI are \"overstated\" and it was added to the brokerage firm's \"Best Ideas List\" (BIL) as well.  At the time, Wedbush raised its target price for Google from $160 to $175, with an \"outperform\" rating. However, Ives now thinks that there is a potential upside of $30 to $40 for the search giant. Overall, Ives has a positive outlook for the tech sector. He thinks that tech stocks have an upside of up to 15% for the rest of the year, on the back of an improved spending environment. Price Action: Alphabet Inc Class A shares were down 0.4% in premarket trading on Friday after closing at $151.94 on the previous day, according to Benzinga Pro.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Despite being a leader in the rollout of artificial intelligence products, Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock hasn’t set the world on fire lately. That might be about to change. Year to date, Microsoft stock is up 13%, which is a little better than the 11% gain achieved by the benchmark S&P 500 index. In the last 12 months, the technology giant’s stock has risen 46%. While decent, the gains pale in comparison to those achieved by other companies that are closely associated with AI. Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock is up 225% over the last year while Meta Platforms’ (NASDAQ:META) share price has increased 136%. Of course, Microsoft is more than an AI company. But it is AI that is likely to drive the company’s sales and profits, and share price, moving forward. Microsoft has been making big bets on AI ever since it invested $10 billion into privately held OpenAI, the company whose AI chatbots took the world by storm last year. More recently, Microsoft has announced plans to build a massive data center to run AI software that could require an investment of $100 billion. That would be an incredible investment considering that Microsoft’s total capital spending over the last four years combined was $104 billion.  The data center investment, which also involves plans to develop an AI supercomputer called “Stargate” for launch in 2028, is the latest example of Microsoft going all-in on AI.  In February of this year, Microsoft announced that it is ramping up its investments in AI around the world, pledging to spend $5.60 billion in Europe alone. At the same time that it is increasing its spending, Microsoft is also pushing to monetize the technology and boost its sales and profits. The best example of the monetization efforts can be found with Microsoft Copilot, the company’s AI chatbot or assistant. Microsoft is now charging subscriptions of $30 a month for access to Copilot, and Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives forecasts that it could add $25 billion to $30 billion to Microsoft’s revenues by 2025. Ives recently boosted his price target on MSFT stock to $500 from $475 and stated that the “AI revolution is here.” Also citing the monetization of Copilot, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) maintained a “buy” rating on Microsoft’s stock and a $480 price target, calling the company a “top pick.” Beyond AI, there are many other business units that are accelerating and benefitting Microsoft. These include the Xbox unit following the successful $69 billion acquisition of video game maker Activision Blizzard, and the Azure cloud-computing segment. Cloud was a particular bright spot in Microsoft’s fourth quarter 2023 earnings report. The company reported that revenue from Azure and other cloud services grew 30% year over year in Q4. Analysts had forecast growth of 27.7%. Microsoft stock now has 53,000 Azure AI customers, and one-third of them are new to Azure in the past year, said the company in its earnings release. Commitments to spend more than $1 billion on Azure cloud services in the year ahead increased during  Q4 2023. Today, Microsoft is the second largest cloud-computing company in the world after Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Data from the Synergy Research Group shows that Microsoft’s Azure infrastructure controls 20% of the world’s $130 billion cloud market. Together, Amazon and Microsoft control 52% of the global cloud market, and cloud-computing remains a huge growth driver at Microsoft.  Microsoft stock achieved a milestone earlier this year when its market capitalization surpassed $3 trillion and it became the biggest publicly traded company in the world. Going forward, more growth and gains can be expected, especially as the company monetizes its AI offerings. With leading role in areas ranging from not only AI but also video games, cloud-computing, and software, Microsoft remains a best-in-class technology concern that should be part of every investors’ portfolio. MSFT stock is a buy. On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in NVDA and MSFT.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Augmented reality (AR), still in its early stages, is set to grow rapidly as recent innovations bring new products to market and ultimately reduce costs. Estimating the market value of augmented reality is challenging, yet conservative predictions suggest it could reach up to $58 billion by 2028, with $38 billion in sales expected this year alone. That growth makes AR stocks a hot opportunity to capitalize on long-term tech trends still in their relative infancy. With the emergence of any new technology, a flood of new companies, startups and innovators are entering the market, seeking investor attention. But not all will succeed. For those interested in strong buy AR stocks, sticking with well-known, reputable companies is the safest bet today. Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), a leading augmented reality manufacturer, is unlikely to allow new market entrants or current competitors to usurp its position. Its collaborative effort with Samsung and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) reinforces its dominance in hardware and signals a promising future as the augmented reality markets evolve. The partnership plans to develop a comprehensive mixed-reality platform, capitalizing on Qualcomm’s technological expertise, Samsung’s hardware prowess and Google’s investments in augmented reality tools. While we’re waiting for a definitive product announcement, industry analysts predict the collaboration will result in a series of headsets offering novel virtual reality experiences, which could significantly boost Qualcomm’s revenue.  In addition, Qualcomm is continuously upgrading its broad virtual reality product array, including headsets. Equipped with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon processor, these products feature the most advanced WiFi technology and eye-tracking capabilities, driving forward innovation in the augmented reality domain and setting new benchmarks for the industry. Though a ways off from its past $3 trillion market cap, Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) ventures into augmented reality remain a top prospect for investors looking for strong buy AR stocks. The company has impressively sold as many as 200,000 Vision Pro headsets already, despite its hefty $3,499 price tag. Sales are expected to increase as the product’s capabilities become evident to early adopters, and the cost of units eventually declines. A potential issue on the horizon is the possibility of the Vision Pro cannibalizing sales from other Apple products, particularly tablets and iPads, which are already experiencing a sales decline. Apple finds itself at a pivotal moment, anticipating the stabilization of Vision Pro sales and determining whether this new hardware and augmented reality technology will be a temporary trend or replicate the groundbreaking impact of the iPod in the mid-2000s. Regardless, Apple currently stands as the leading augmented reality stock, making it an excellent choice for investors seeking a blue-chip entry into the burgeoning market. Meta (NASDAQ:META) closely trails Apple but might soon overtake it as a leader in the augmented reality (AR) market. A major consumer review has placed Apple’s Vision Pro and Meta’s Quest Pro on equal footing, rating them both at four stars. However, Quest Pro’s much lower price point positions the product not merely as a cheaper alternative to Apple’s but as a cost-effective innovator independent of the brand-name weight Apple carries. That distinction makes Meta a compelling AR stock option. Beyond the Quest Pro, Mark Zuckerberg and his team are reportedly working on projects that could significantly impact their AR efforts. In mid-January, Zuckerberg announced significant investments in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) chips. The move supports Meta’s AI development and suggests a major commitment to building a “massive compute infrastructure” likely to enhance AR platforms, particularly with AI integration.  Matching Apple in the realm of blue-chip AR stocks, Meta represents a reliable investment to tap into emerging trends within the developing AR sector.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Meme coins to sell are not a hot topic of discussion right now as we move towards the fourth Bitcoin halving in mid-April. A deflationary event like the halving often sparks a Bitcoin (BTC-USD) bull run. Bitcoin, which already notched a new all-time high of around $73,000 this year, is the bellwether for the sector. So, if it grows, so does the industry. Pretty simple logic? However, at the heart of any investment is value. Because Bitcoin functions as a hedge against inflation, investors favor it, particularly in countries like El Salvador and the Central African Republic, where it has been accepted as legal cash. In the case of Ethereum (ETH-USD), the ecosystem will be upgraded in 2024 by a number of innovations. However, the meme coins we will explore do not offer the same type of utility. Now seems like a good time to cash out while their valuations are up. Shiba Inu (SHIB-USD) starts our discussion on meme coins to sell, as the gap between market speculation and genuine utility forces investors to take notice.  The meme currency was initially created as a joke in August 2020, and even with its $15 billion market valuation, it is still mostly just a joke with almost no real-world utility. A lack of use cases is its ultimate downfall, both as an investment and as a project. Shiba Inu’s only ally is celebrity hype, chiefly Elon Musk, the CEO of SpaceX and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). And, Musk has a history of openly supporting meme coins. His logic is that meme coins are for the little guy. However, many fans of Shiba Inu realize that beyond trading, both ETH and BTC offer something to the investor, whether as a store of value or a platform for decentralized applications. That is the problem Shiba Inu needs to solve; otherwise, it will remain one of the meme coins to sell for the foreseeable future. Dogecoin (DOGE-USD) follows in the footsteps of Shiba Inu, as there is more similarities than differences between the two. It started out life as a lighthearted joke in December 2013. Two software engineers wanted to offer satire on the wild speculation of the crypto markets. Unfortunately, the two caused more inadvertent speculation in the crypto sphere when the meme coin caught on. Once again, thanks to Tesla CEO Elon Musk.  In March, Musk made hints that Tesla would accept the meme-based cryptocurrency as payment for its cars “at some point” during an event. Dogecoin is already accepted as payment for other Tesla merchandise purchases. Dogecoin saw a price spike when Musk dubbed it “the people’s crypto.” The title reaffirmed support at a time when faith in the coin was wavering. And, many in the investing community thought his endorsement was a thing of the past. Altogether, Dogecoin enthusiasts can use the meme coin for small tips and also fundraising activities. But they will have to wait for the next Musk X post or major announcement to move the needle in terms of price. And no one can accurately predict Elon Musk’s next move. Pepe (PEPE-USD) is another one of the meme coins to sell as we head into the Bitcoin halving cycle. With respect to utility, the coin has little to say; much of its value is speculation. Now, that’s not to say there is no market speculation from which to benefit. PEPE has experienced a lot of trading activity. Especially on Binance, accumulating millions of dollars worth of PEPE.  At the height of the meme coin frenzy, the PEPE token’s market cap soared to $500 million in 2023, doubling its value in a week’s time. However, PEPE let go of these gains later on in the year, as investors took profits, particularly in exchange for the more established Ethereum. In addition, Pepe has encountered issues that have eroded investor confidence. Such as insider trading, with the founders reportedly stealing around $15 million worth of tokens. Such occurrences cast doubt on the project’s openness and governance, providing more headaches for investors who already have to deal with a lack of utility.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Ken Fisher of Fisher Asset Management comes from investing royalty. His father, Philip Fisher, wrote the investment classic “Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits” and whom Morningstar called “one of the great investors of all time.” He was a long-term, buy-and-hold investor who, like Warren Buffett, believed the best time to sell a stock was “almost never.” Many of those attributes were passed down to his son, who manages $265 billion in assets under management (AUM). Despite its size, Fisher Asset Management has notched some impressive gains over the past decade. The firm’s 10-year annual returns are north of 58%, while over the last five years, Fisher returned 63%. In just the last 12 months he is up to 24%. Although he has a large portfolio containing well over 900 companies, these are the three stocks dominating this investing icon’s portfolio today. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) recently slipped to fifth place as the most valuable company in Fisher’s portfolio, but its performance so far this year has been stellar. AMZN stock is up 20% year to date and more than 76% higher over the past year.  Because the online retailer is so integral to the economy, it was added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average. It’s not just because of its e-commerce platform but also its cloud services business, which provides the backbone for the internet presence of numerous companies. And it continues to improve itself. Cost-cutting measures and integration of artificial intelligence (AI) are paying benefits to Amazon. Strong revenue and better profit margins over the past few quarters are just some of the tangible results of its efforts. Perhaps most notable is the surge in advertising revenue, up 27% last quarter to $14.7 billion. It is already the third-largest ad platform behind Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). Fisher owns 41.8 million shares of Amazon stock worth $7.6 billion, making it the fourth-largest position in his portfolio at 3.7% of the total. With an average purchase price of around $54 per share, Fisher has seen his investment more than triple in value. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the biggest position Fisher owns. It represents 5% of his portfolio. Few stocks are as closely associated with AI as Microsoft. Having integrated OpenAI’s ChatGPT generative AI technology into all aspects of its operations, the tech giant is receiving significant dividends. AI contributed 600 basis points of growth to Microsoft’s Azure cloud services business last quarter, double what it had done just one quarter prior. It is also helping Microsoft land more and bigger deals for longer contractual periods of time.  Clients like Azure. It allows them to grow their transition to the cloud at their own pace. The hybrid environment lets them choose the level of service they want and where they want it. They can choose between on-premises, in the cloud or a combination of both. Expect to see AI’s growth rate and contribution to Microsoft accelerate in the coming quarters. Fisher owns 25.4 million shares of MSFT stock worth $10.7 billion. He’s generated gains of 291% so far with his average purchase price of $107 per share. The No. two holding in Fisher Asset Management is Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Despite all the headwinds the consumer electronics stock faces, Apple has tripled Fisher’s investment from the average buy-in price of $51 per share. Yet the headwinds are legion. Most notable is the Justice Dept. suing Apple for antitrust violations. Although some of the allegations seem ludicrous, such as operating a monopoly when it has but a 57% share of the domestic smartphone market, it will be a distraction for management as it fights back against the charges. Apple also has its work cut out for it in China, one of its biggest markets but also one that has seen sales slow dramatically. Its iPhone sales reportedly plummeted 33% in China in January and February, according to Bloomberg News. Of course, March tends to be the strongest month of the three in the quarter, so we will need to see how the iPhone fared then.  The consumer tech leader has its next iteration of the smartphone coming out later this year. The iPhone 16 should also have some form of Google’s own AI technology accessible so it could be a big seller. Apple stock is down 9% year-to-date, but no one suggests the party is over by a long shot.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Microchip and semiconductor concern Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has led the market ever since the current rally began in autumn 2022. Its run has been incredible. Since October 2022, NVDA stock has increased 695%. The company’s share price has risen an astounding 1,765% over the last five years. The growth has pushed Nvidia’s market capitalization to above $2 trillion and made it the third largest publicly traded company in the world after Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). The key to the success of NVDA stock has been the rising demand for the company’s chips and semiconductors, which are used to power artificial intelligence models and applications. The massive worldwide demand has led to a surge in Nvidia’s sales and profits. For the final quarter of 2023, Nvidia reported that its sales increased 265% from a year earlier and its profits grew 769% year over year. The company’s earnings reports have become a highly anticipated and closely watched event across the entire stock market. So who will be the next Nvidia? Which companies are positioned to steal its crown? Here are three AI stocks that will leave Nvidia in the dust. Shares of Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) are running circles around Nvidia right now. MU stock has risen by 34% in the past month after the company announced financial results that beat Wall Street forecasts and provided upbeat forward guidance driven by AI demand. Micron, which makes memory and storage for computers and specializes in USB flash drives, announced in March earnings per share of 42 cents compared to a loss of 25 cents that was expected among analysts who cover the company.  Revenue amounted to $5.82 billion versus $5.35 billion, which was expected on Wall Street. Management said the company is benefitting from the current AI boom, with demand for its memory and computer data storage products rising. Micron provides memory and storage for new AI systems around the world. Looking ahead, executives said they expect to report revenue of $6.60 billion for the just-completed first quarter, which is above the $6.02 billion that was expected by analysts. Thanks to its post-earnings bounce, MU stock has now been up 55% since the start of this year and has more than doubled over the last 12 months. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is nipping at Nvidia’s heels. One of its most direct competitors, AMD, as the company is known, has developed a series of microchips specifically for AI models and applications that it hopes will rival Nvidia’s chips and semiconductors. Last December, AMD unveiled a new series of microchips called the “Ryzen 8040” that are aimed at boosting AI applications by up to 60%. Those new chips will be incorporated into laptops and personal computers (PCs). AMD has also launched the new MI300X accelerator microchip that’s used in data centers and servers and competes against Nvidia’s AI data center chips. Companies ranging from Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) to Microsoft have been buying up the MI300X chips, and AMD executives have said that they expect the data center microchips to generate $2 billion in sales for all of this year. The new AI microchips and decent earnings have AMD stock up 87% over the last 12 months, including a 30% gain so far in 2024. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (NYSE:TSM) is arguably the most important company to Nvidia and the entire AI industry. This is because TSMC, as the company is popularly known, makes three-quarters (75%) of the microchips in the world, including those designed by Nvidia, as well as nearly all the chips and semiconductors that power AI technologies. The growing importance of TSMC to the AI and chip industries has its stock up by 52% in the last year, including a 39% year-to-date gain.  During their most recent earnings call, TSMC executives said that the company is well-positioned to capture current and future growth opportunities, especially related to AI. Taiwan Semiconductor is increasingly focused on AI chips and semiconductors as it executes a global expansion plan. The company recently opened its first microchip plant in Japan, moving beyond its home market in Taiwan. It is also developing two new microchip plants in Arizona at a cost of $40 billion. TSM stock has more than tripled over the last five years. On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in NVDA and MSFT.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips The future of the U.S. economy looks promising, with recent data suggesting ongoing growth and stability. The stock market, particularly the Nasdaq Composite Index, continues to show impressive gains over the past several months. This underscores confidence in the market’s trajectory. Historical trends indicate that after periods of sustained growth like this, the Nasdaq has often seen further increases, with median performance one year later showing gains of 14.8%. Risks are always to be considered, such as potential declines seen in the past. But overall, the outlook remains positive, buoyed by strong economic fundamentals and robust corporate performance. This Nasdaq bull market is projected to sustain. Let’s delve into the top three Nasdaq stocks that will continue to skyrocket and drive your portfolio value. Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a retail company engaging in the sale of consumer products and advertising. And Amazon Web Services (AWS), which provides cloud computing services, has led to Amazon’s revenue and profit growing over the last few years.  Earnings have been rising consistently as of the last financial year. Furthermore, 51 Yahoo Finance analysts have set an average growth target of 15.7%. AMZN has a profit margin of 5.29% and an operating margin of 7.52%. Clearly, this is impressive given the complex, capital-intensive nature of Amazon’s logistical operations, a key component of its retail services. Coming from a lackluster 2022, quarterly revenue growth year over year (YOY) is 3,721.60%, with EBITDA at $85.52 billion. The Consumer Cyclical sector is projected to grow 36% over the next 5 years. Additionally, AMZN is rated as overweight/outperform by multiple institutions, which hold 62.83% of Amazon. And AWS is encouraging innovation and gaining additional customers by giving startups free credits and allowing these credits to be used on models from companies such as Anthropic and Meta. Finally, an improving foothold in the advertisement sector is also opening up a new front for growth. Therefore, Amazon is likely to continue growing, given the aggressive innovation it pursues and encourages. This stock is a buy! Chinese technology company Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) specializes in internet services, products and artificial intelligence (AI). Currently trading at $108.32, it has a 12-month median price target of $154.34. This represents an increase of 42.49%. In Q4 2023, Baidu reported stellar earnings, showing growth across the board. The company enjoys a revenue increase 6% YOY to $4.92 billion. Net income jumped an astonishing 48% to $366 million, showcasing Baidu’s focus on enhancing operational efficiencies. This success was mirrored in results for fiscal 2023. The company’s goal to persistently improve efficiency and achieve high-quality growth is paying off as net income skyrocketed 169% to $2.86 billion.  Furthermore, this growth will likely continue in 2024. The company was reported to have entered preliminary talks with tech giant Apple to include Baidu’s generative AI in Apple’s devices within China. This collaboration is largely spurred by unique regulatory concerns that the Chinese market presents. China requires that generative AI models must be approved before being launched to the public. And, Baidu’s ERNIE Bot is among those already approved by its cyberspace regulator. Thus, this is providing a huge opportunity for Baidu to grow its AI solutions amid China’s burgeoning AI market. Based on the company’s AI strategy and strong financial position, analysts expect revenue for fiscal 2024 to increase 7.8% to $20.08 billion. Therefore, Baidu’s AI innovation and growth ambitions hold immense long-term gains potential, paving the way for continued future success. Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is one of the largest international technology parent companies. It oversees a broad range of industry giants in social media and communication technologies. Those include Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and more. With the strength of these businesses, Meta is home to a $506.74 valuation with a YOY growth of 137.83%. Also, META reported a strong financial outing in Q4 2023 with sizable growth across the board. Additionally, it outperformed consensus industry forecasts of both EPS and revenue. On the revenue side, META reeled in $40.11 billion, or a growth of 24.7%. Both net income and diluted EPS increase YOY by around 200%, reporting $14.02 billion and $5.3 respectively. In addition, META concluded its 2023 business year on a strong note and hopes to carry similar performance into 2024 on the backs of the AI boom. From 2023-2024, AI has been a key topic for investors. And Meta certainly hasn’t been shy about announcing their new AI developments, including their planned adoption of an AI video ecosystem. These plans, along with recruitments for AI development heads, suggest Meta is on the right track and set for an AI boom of its own.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Many top social media stocks seem to be making the most of the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). Undoubtedly, AI is a powerful technology that can drive growth, value and even efficiency across any enterprise (or individual) that harnesses it effectively. For social media companies, which have massive treasure troves of user data, I view a significant opportunity to gain ground on the back of AI technologies. That’s true whether it’s used to maximize the effectiveness of targeted ads or to serve up content to maximize user engagement. It’s not just the AI opportunity that makes social media stocks one of the more intriguing corners of the tech scene right now. The rise of the metaverse could also be a major boon as 2D content goes 3D and uptake for spatial computers, headsets and other devices rise steadily over the next five years. Here are three impressive and undervalued social media stocks that I think have long-term growth prospects. No surprises here. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) takes the top spot for social media stocks likely trading well below its potential worth. Its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, has proved his critics dead wrong, harnessing the power of AI in a way that few industry rivals could.  The result? A generational rally in the stock off its 2022 lows. The stock is now up more than 450% from its November 2022 depths and is well above its September 2021 peak that preceded a nasty 76% peak-to-trough decline. As the company continues to improve its large language model capabilities, while also finding ways to maximize value from new AI innovations, META stock is not a company I would dare short-sell, even as it leaves some of its Magnificent Seven rivals behind. With the Quest headset and metaverse wild card to also look forward over the coming 10 years, perhaps the 35.3 times trailing price-to-earnings screams value, not froth. Snap (NASDAQ:SNAP) has had no luck bouncing back from its own meltdown, which saw shares crumble around 90% from peak to trough. Undoubtedly, Snap is no Meta. But it doesn’t have to be to engineer some sort of sustained rally, at least in my humble opinion. The company is innovating on the generative AI front with intriguing new AI tools to help keep its mostly younger users entertained. From funny augmented-reality (AR) filters to AI-powered chatbots right in the Snapchat app, the company is covering as many bases as it can. Thus far, there haven’t been many signs of any such efforts powering the share price higher. Perhaps Snap needs to be more deliberate about how it chooses to invest in such emerging technologies.  Either way, I think Snap has much to learn from Meta as it looks to level up its intriguing tech-driven monetization. Perhaps Snap’s new sponsored AR filters could offer a glimpse into the future of ads in the mixed-reality age. Pinterest (NASDAQ:PINS) stock, which also imploded like a paper bag back in 2021 (and part of 2022), is starting to pick up momentum again. Though it’s still far off (around 58%) from its all-time highs, I’d argue that at this trajectory, new highs over the next few years may not be so unrealistic — not while the company experiments with intriguing new ways to serve ads. After pulling back after a recent quarterly disappointment, shares are now down 3% year to date. I view the dip as more of a buying opportunity than a sell signal, as the firm looks to benefit from AI technologies to offer its unique take on content personalization. At 28.1 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E), PINS stock stands out as one of the cheaper social media stocks out there. Though its recent rally faced a setback, I wouldn’t look for shares to reverse course as the firm continues investing heavily in intriguing AI and ad efforts.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips April showers bring not only flowers, but presents an opportunity to capitalize on hot growth stocks to buy in April. The stock market can be unpredictable, but a select few companies consistently demonstrate the potential for high returns. This year the tech industry remains a hotbed for innovation, thanks to the long term tailwinds of artificial intelligence. If you feel like you may have missed the boat, then you’re surely mistaken. These established growth stocks are fiery heavy weights, vying for industry disruption. Now, let’s discover the top hot growth stocks to buy in April to make a positive splash in your portfolio! Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), a leading technology giant is currently at the forefront of the AI revolution. They have been making significant investments into generative AI and the metaverse, set to create new revenue growth opportunities in 2024.  Meta is one of the largest technology companies in the world, and owns notable subsidiaries like WhatsApp and Instagram. Earlier this year, the company surged past the $1 trillion market cap status, driven by significant restructuring efforts in 2023 and key investments into generative AI. Furthermore, the company is set to release their new LLM, Llama 3 in July 2024. This has investors existing about the company’s increased focus on its AI investments. In FY23, Meta’s key growth metrics and profitability increased dramatically. Revenue swelled 16% YOY to $134.9 billion. EPS increased 73% to $14.87 per share, with FCF hitting a record $44 billion. The company continues to reinvent new growth initiatives, with planned CAPEX in the $30-$37 billion range. With a maturing financial profile and a reasonable valuation, Meta remains a top hot growth stocks to buy in April. Palantir (NYSE:PLTR) is currently one of the most talked about AI stocks on the street. Over the last year, the company achieved its first full year of GAAP profitability and growth is set to continue in 2024. Palantir’s technology has proven invaluable to defense contractors and national security agencies. The company was primarily founded on its capabilities to supply big data and machine learning models for government agencies including the FBI, CIA, NSA, and the United States Department of Defense. However, Palantir is now expanding its commercial business which is seeing accelerating revenue growth. In Q4 2023, their commercial revenue increased 70% YOY to $131 million. Their AIP is gaining traction, and a number of different sectors are leveraging their platform. Furthermore, investors are anticipating an S&P 500 inclusion sometime this year. This could be a huge catalyst for the company, and CEO Alex Karp anticipates another year of profitable growth in FY24.  Spotify (NYSE:SPOT), is one of the biggest sleeper growth stocks to buy in 2024. They are currently the world’s leading music streaming platform, and currently boast more than 600 million MAUs. In recent years, Spotify has been diversifying its content offerings by incorporating podcasts and exclusive audio content. This strategy has not only attracted new users, but has also enhanced user engagement and retention. The company is also leveraging artificial intelligence to create more personalized experiences to drive revenue growth. In Q3 2023, the company declared a surprise profit of $0.33 per share, signally that the business had hit a key inflection point. Gross margins have continued to expand over the last several quarters, and premium subscriber growth remains strong. Furthermore, Spotify’s FCF skyrocketed to $674 million in the 2024 fiscal year. With sustained double digit growth in MAUs, Spotify is one of the best hot growth stocks to buy in April.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Some investors prefer to construct their own portfolios in hopes of beating the stock market. Most people with this objective prioritize growth stocks that exhibit promising catalysts. This has led to this list of the most undervalued growth stocks to buy in April. While growth stocks give you the best shot at outperforming the stock market, these same investments can lose significant value if the growth narrative changes. Many growth stocks have lofty valuations as investors think more about what corporations can become rather than what they already are. A misalignment between expectations and reality can cause quite a stir. However, investors can choose undervalued growth stocks that offer strong financial growth and respectable valuations. These are some of the top undervalued growth stocks to consider. Deckers Outdoor (NYSE:DECK) is gaining market share in the athletic apparel industry. While heavyweights like Nike (NYSE:NKE) are growing at slower rates, Deckers Outdoor continues to run laps around the competition.  The corporation has several brands under its umbrella, but the two largest ones are Hoka and Ugg. Revenue and earnings growth both came in at healthy rates in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Sales increased by 16% year-over-year while profits jumped by 40% year-over-year. The recently added member of the S&P 500 has been on an incredible run over the past five years. The stock is up by more than 500% during that stretch. Momentum has continued based on the stock’s 34% year-to-date gain. Shares have doubled over the past year and have a 32 P/E ratio. Deckers Outdoor continues to expand its profit margins while gaining market share. The latest quarter featured a 25% net profit margin. American Express (NYSE:AXP) is a top fintech stock with an impressive dividend program. The firm recently announced a 17% dividend hike. The quarterly dividend now stands at $0.70 per share. American Express has doubled its dividend since 2018 and looks poised to elevate its dividend for many years. The company aims to report 10% year-over-year revenue growth and an EPS growth rate in the mid-teens each year beyond 2026. American Express fulfilled that goal in the fourth quarter with an 11% year-over-year increase in revenue. Net income jumped by 23% year-over-year in that quarter.  The stock has more than doubled over the past five years and comes with a reasonable 20 P/E ratio. The firm has profit margins in the low double-digits and is poised to raise its margins each year for several years. American Express offers reasonable value and a compelling dividend growth rate for long-term investors. The yield is currently 1.24%. This makes it one of those most undervalued growth stocks to buy in April. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is arguably the most undervalued member of the Magnificent Seven. The advertising giant trades at a 29 P/E ratio and has been expanding its profit margins thanks to cost-cutting and top-line growth. The corporation reported 13% year-over-year revenue growth in Q4 2023 as its advertising segment continues to rebound. The 13% growth rate is an acceleration from last year’s 7% year-over-year growth rate. Alphabet also reported $20.7 billion in net income which is 52% higher than last year’s profits. Google Cloud revenue continues to grow at a faster pace than the company’s advertising network. Cloud revenue reached $9.2 billion, which was 25.6% higher than in the same period last year. Google Cloud had a $186 million net loss in Q4 2022 but turned in $864 million worth of profits in Q4 2023. Alphabet stock is up by 49% over the past year. It has also gained 158% over the past five years and recently claimed an all-time high. It’s also one of those most undervalued growth stocks to buy in April.  Most investors wouldn’t consider big bank stocks as growth stocks. However, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) is an exception. The financial institution has outperformed the S&P 500 with a 53% gain over the past year. JPMorgan has also been up by 89% over the past five years and offers a 2.31% dividend yield. The corporation regularly posts high-profit margins that hover above 25%. The stock also has a 12 P/E ratio which offers a good margin of safety. JPMorgan reported $9.3 billion in net income in the fourth quarter of 2023. It’s slightly down from last year but still paved the way for a 26% profit margin. Net income would have been $12.1 billion if it weren’t for losses related to the FDIC special assessment and discretionary securities losses. Revenue increased by 11% year-over-year. Any banking fears can create a good opportunity for JPMorgan. The company swooped in to acquire First Republic as that bank was about to go under, and it could follow suit with other banks. When banks shut down, customers tend to put their money into big banks like JPMorgan to ride the uncertainty. Synopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS) is a semiconductor company that creates high-performance silicon chips. You can find these chips in machine-learning devices, self-driving cars, computers, appliances, and other resources. The company has been in business for more than 35 years and has annual revenue in excess of $5 billion. The semiconductor firm trades at a 44 forward P/E ratio and has a $63 billion market cap. The stock is up by 47% over the past year and has soared by 389% over the past five years. Synopsis reported a strong first quarter to start fiscal 2024. Revenue increased by 21% year-over-year while net income surged by 65% year-over-year. The company’s net profit margin reached 27% in the quarter. All in all, it’s one of those most undervalued growth stocks to buy in April.  Synopsys stands to benefit from artificial intelligence tailwinds. Another key catalyst is the company’s upcoming acquisition of Ansys (NASDAQ:ANSS). The acquisition will help Synopsys gain market share and sustain high revenue and earnings growth rates. Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) offers an essential service. The company produces construction equipment and has been around for almost 100 years. The corporation has stayed relevant and expanded through various economic cycles, including the Great Depression. The stock trades at an 18 P/E ratio and offers a 1.43% yield. Shares are up by 59% over the past year and have rallied by 160% over the past five years. Caterpillar has an impressive dividend program and recently hiked its quarterly payout from $1.20 per share to $1.30 per share. That’s an 8.3% year-over-year increase. Caterpillar recently reported a 13% year-over-year increase in full-year sales. The corporation also returned $7.5 billion to shareholders in 2023 via dividends and stock buybacks. Record sales and adjusted profit per share indicate the stock can continue to gain momentum from current levels. The stock is rated as a “Moderate Buy” with the highest price target of $395 per share indicating an 8% upside.  Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is gushing with cash flow after prioritizing profits in 2023. Net income more than tripled in the fourth quarter of 2023 and prompted the company to issue its first dividend. Revenue growth came in at an impressive 25% year-over-year. That’s an acceleration from the company’s 16% year-over-year revenue growth for all of 2023. The company has a robust advertising network that continues to attract new users and increase the engagement of existing users. The number of daily active users across Meta Platforms’ social networks increased by 8% year-over-year. Monthly active users were up by 6% year-over-year across all of its platforms. Businesses can use advanced targeting features to get in front of the right customers. This advantage makes it more difficult for companies to switch from Meta Platforms to another opportunity that can generate similar returns. Meta Platforms trades at a 33 P/E ratio and offers a 0.40% dividend yield. It’s also one of those most undervalued growth stocks to buy in April.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips On the one hand, April is when spring comes into full bloom. On the other hand, April is tax season during which we pay the piper and settle up with Uncle Sam. However, I’m convinced this is a great month to be an investor, so I’m always looking for A-rated stocks to buy in April. April is historically a good month for the stock market. Since 1945, April has averaged a return of 1.6%, tied only with December as the best-performing month of the year. Some of this can be attributed to Uncle Sam and the tax filing deadline. If you’ve done well on your taxes and are getting a return, congratulations! One of the best things you can do with that money is to put it into the stock market, which brings a potential uptick in stock prices. April also kicks off the second quarter of the year. Companies report their first-quarter earnings in April, providing investors with a bellwether of how the rest of the year will look. Solid earnings reports can drive stock prices higher.  I’m using the Portfolio Grader to find the best A-rated stocks to buy for April. These stocks get their “A” ratings because of their solid performance, earnings growth, analyst sentiment, and momentum. Any of them would be a great pick if you want to splash the market this month. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is revolutionizing the tech industry with its powerful graphics processing units that can power artificial intelligence and machine learning applications. The stock rose nearly 240% in 2023 and its revenue soared to more than $20 billion per quarter, a ridiculously steep increase that pushed Nvidia’s market cap to more than $2.2 trillion. But if you’re betting that Nvidia’s growth is a bubble getting ready to pop, you’re betting on the wrong horse. Nvidia is just getting started. Big Tech stocks are all clamoring to incorporate generative AI into their products. And while it’s still unclear which of these companies will ultimately emerge as king of the heap, Nvidia is in the enviable position of having a virtual monopoly with its generative AI chips.  And that was even before it unveiled its Blackwell GPUs, the latest in Nvidia’s line of AI chip products that should help extend Nvidia’s growth runway through 2024 and beyond. NVDA stock is up 80% in 2024 and gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader. I’m starting to think of Nvidia and Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) going hand-in-hand these days. SMCI  has an immensely powerful position in providing the infrastructure, including server and storage solutions, that a company using NVDA’s chips will need. The stock has risen nearly tenfold over the past year, hitting $1,000 per share. While some skeptics believe that Supermicro is a bubble ready to pop, I still believe that another rally could be at hand. Annual revenue for the AI server market is expected to grow from $39 billion in 2023 to $200 billion by 2027. Supermicro won’t get all that business, but it should see more than its fair share.  SCMI stock is up 255% in 2024 and gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is my top pick for social media stocks that should have an outstanding April. Thanks to its Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp platforms, the company counts nearly half the world’s population as active users. After a horrendous 2022, Meta managed to turn things around in 2023 by getting back to basics: focusing on profitability and its core business. The company’s headcount is down by 22% from a year ago. Meta Platforms showed fourth-quarter revenue of $40.1 billion, up 25% from a year ago on the strength of improved advertising dollars. Income of $14 billion and $5.33 per share improved from $4.6 billion and $1.76 per share a year ago.  Look for Meta to continue to harness the power of AI and machine learning to optimize advertising and bring value to its customers. META stock is up 40% this year and gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader. With over 10,800 locations, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) is the biggest retailer in the world. And it uses that power to its advantage. CEO Doug McMillon describes how Walmart purposefully keeps the prices of its own brands low, which pressures national brands that want to display their goods on Walmart shelves to lower their prices to Walmart as well. This not only appeals to shoppers who are looking to stretch their dollars, but it also undercuts the competition and puts Walmart in a better position to dominate its local markets. Walmart has locations in every state and more than two dozen countries, giving it a massive footprint. And it also has a thriving e-commerce division, which reached $100 billion in sales in 2023.  WMT stock is up 12% in 2024 and gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader. Eli Lilly & Co. (NYSE:LLY) is a top pharmaceutical company with the advantage of being on the ground floor of one of the hottest healthcare developments in years. Lilly sees massive potential with its obesity drug, Zepbound. The National Institutes of Health estimates that 42% of U.S. adults are obese, and there are dozens of diet programs and trends that make billions of dollars from customers who are looking for a way to drop some weight. Zepbound’s solution is an injectable drug that helps people lose weight. About 1 in 3 people who took the drug at its highest dose (15 mg) report losing more than 58 pounds over a 72-week period. The drug is so popular that some pharmacies are reporting shortages.  Analysts say Zepbound could be worth $25 billion a year or more in revenue to Lilly. That massive potential is why LLY stock is up 31% in 2024. It gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader. International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) just keeps rolling along. The company is one of the oldest and best-known computing companies, responsible for generations of advances. While some technology companies come and go, Big Blue has been a mainstay since the early 20th century. Even today, IBM computers handle as many as 90% of all credit card transactions and serve over 90% of financial institutions. Today, IBM is one of the biggest cloud infrastructure providers in the world. And it has one of the best-known names in generative AI, watsonx, which will help attract customers looking for support for AI applications and cloud solutions. For instance, golf fans watching the Masters Tournament this year will be able to see shot-by-shot insights on the Masters website and app, including data-driven projections and analysis for each hole.  IBM stock is up 15% in 2024, and gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader. Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) transformed and disrupted an entire industry when launched its ridesharing business. It opened a path for people who don’t own a taxicab to earn money as a side gig. And it rode that business model to profitability. Today, Uber is a massive company with more than $160 billion market capitalization. And its continuing to grow, expanding into food delivery with its Uber Eats service. It’s expanding into India, the globe’s most populous country. And it’s being added to the Dow Jones Transportation Average. Uber said it computed 2.6 million trips in the fourth quarter, up 24% from the previous year. Gross bookings were up 22% to 37.5 billion, and the company’s revenue was up 15% to $9.93 billion. For the full year, Uber saw $137.8 billion in gross bookings, up 19% from 2022, and revenue of $37.2 billion, a gain of 17% from a year ago.  UBER stock will only continue to grow from here. The stock is up 25% in 2024 and gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader. On the date of publication, Louis Navellier had a long position in NVDA, SMCI and LLY.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock has emerged as Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) main AI market. The focus shifts to how this will affect Nvidia’s market share. Meta (NASDAQ:META) and Microsoft’s (NASDQ:MSFT) planned switch to AMD chips, representing 60% of Nvidia’s sales, indicates significant potential shifts. In the AI surge, AMD trails only Nvidia, which is known for its rapid growth. With AI’s rapid growth, AMD holds promise as the second-largest AI chip player. Considering this, let’s dive into why AMD stock remains an excellent option for investors looking for exposure to this space. AMD stock is up meaningfully on the year (roughly 28% higher), but still clearly trails the likes of Nvidia and other AI stocks. This relative valuation gap has been growing, and makes AMD stock an attractive option for growth-at-a-reasonable-price investors, who have clamored to own this stock at lower levels. Concerns around China’s chip replacement strategy briefly impacted prices, and Nvidia’s release of next-generation Blackwell GPUs certainly altered some investors’ view of the competitive landscape of this industry.  That said, it’s a global game, and though China makes up around 15% of AMD’s sales, there’s a lot to like about the company’s relative positioning in the PC market, which appears to be stabilizing. A recent surge in global PC demand bodes well for AMD’s client processor business. Similar growth prospects loom in server CPU and GPU markets. AMD’s server CPU market share rose to 23% in 2023 from 17.6% a year prior, driven by solid demand for EPYC CPUs, noted CEO Lisa Su. The company noted a rising adoption of EPYC CPUs for inferencing tasks. The company’s server CPU growth is sustained, aligning with a projected 26% annual growth in AI server demand until 2029. AMD experienced a robust demand for AI GPUs, raising its data center GPU revenue forecast to $3.5 billion from $2 billion.  Management expects surpassing this figure because of an enhanced supply chain. These factors position AMD favorably to exceed analyst forecasts. In its Q4 2023 report on January 30, 2024, AMD projected Q1 2024 revenue to come in at $5.4 billion, nearly matching the prior year’s $5.35 billion. The semiconductor company sees a 52% non-GAAP gross margin, slightly higher than 2023’s 50%. When talking about revenue, experts expect a much lower number of around $5 billion. With the potential AI-related advantages mentioned, AMD may surpass market expectations significantly. Its recent decline lowered the company’s valuation, with AMD stock now trading at 49-times forward earnings and less than 13-times sales. While expensive, AMD remains the relative value play in the chip space right now, making this an attractive option if the company can blow out earnings expectations in the coming quarters.  AMD trails Nvidia in AI but possesses potent AI accelerator designs and is leveraging third-party manufacturing solutions. If AMD gains AI market share, it may move up in terms of investor discussions alongside Nvidia. Hence, the shift led to reinvestment in undervalued stocks favors AMD, at least right now. Of course, plenty of downside is possible, if the company disappoints in its coming quarterly earnings reports. However, I remain bullish on this stock for now, and believe the AI market is big enough for two players to benefit. Right now, the market disagrees.

      "The “Magnificent Seven” is a term coined to describe big tech giants such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), Meta (NASDAQ:META), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). Each of these stocks gained at least 49% in 2023 and have strong competitive advantages. Here, I have shortlisted one Magnificent Seven stock, Alphabet, to see if it is a good buy right now. Overall, I am bullish on Alphabet due to its attractive valuation, the AI megatrend, and its expanding profit margins. Alphabet is the parent company of Google, the largest search engine platform globally. Valued at $1.93 trillion, Alphabet generates a majority of its sales from online ads on its search engine and YouTube, which Google acquired more than a decade ago. Moreover, Alphabet sells applications, digital content, and in-app purchases via the Google Play store. In recent years, Alphabet has entered high-growth segments such as public cloud and artificial intelligence, diversifying its revenue streams in the process. Shares of Alphabet went public in August 2004 and have since returned a monstrous 5,637%. It means a $1,000 investment in GOOGL stock soon after its IPO would be worth close to $60,000 today. In this period, the S&P 500 Index (SPX) returned “just” 600%.  Despite an uncertain macro environment in 2023, Alphabet increased its sales by 9% year-over-year to $307 billion. Its top-line growth accelerated to 13% in the December quarter, surpassing $86 billion. A focus on cost optimization meant the company’s cost of sales rose by only 5% to $23.6 billion, while operating expenses stood at $25 billion, up 11%, allowing the tech giant to report an operating income of $23.7 billion, up 30% compared to the year-ago period, indicating a healthy margin of 27%. A high operating margin translates into free cash flow, which can be deployed to reinvest in organic growth, enhance shareholder wealth, and target accretive acquisitions. In Q4, Alphabet reported free cash flow of $7.9 billion, while the number was much higher at $69 billion in 2023. Similar to other tech heavyweights, Alphabet allocated $62 billion to share buybacks for its Class A and Class C shares last year and ended 2023 with $111 billion in total cash. Alphabet is among the leading players in the artificial intelligence space. In fact, the company is deploying AI capabilities to improve its portfolio of products from Search to ads. In the last year, Alphabet launched AI-powered products such as Bard and Gemini, which should fuel the next generation of advances.  While Gemini has encountered some issues, the platform is engineered to understand and combine text, images, audio, video, and code while running on devices ranging from smartphones to data centers. Alphabet emphasized that it is experimenting with Gemini in Search, making SGE (Search Generative Experience) faster for users. By integrating AI with Search, Alphabet serves a wide range of information requirements. Bard is Alphabet’s conversational AI tool that is powered by Gemini Pro. Available in 40 languages and 230 countries, Bard will remain a key platform for Alphabet, going forward. Alphabet ended 2023 with more than $15 billion in annual subscription revenue, primarily driven by YouTube. Today, YouTube Music and YouTube Premium are available in more than 100 countries, and these platforms enjoy a highly engaged user base. Generally, recurring sales allow a company to generate steady cash flows across market cycles. Alphabet’s increase in subscription sales over the years showcases its ability to deliver high-value offerings to a wide range of users.  Another subscription service offered by Alphabet is Google One, where you pay to store your photos, videos, files, and other data. Google One is experiencing strong user growth and has attracted almost 100 million subscribers to date. Turning to Google Cloud, the business increased sales by 26% year-over-year in Q4 to $9.2 billion. The segment is now reporting consistent profits, ending Q4 with an operating income of $864 million, indicating a margin of 9%. For FY 2023, Google Cloud sales rose 26% to $33 billion, accounting for more than 10% of total revenue. Google Cloud aims to integrate Gemini to widen its base of enterprise customers which should also drive engagement rates higher. Alphabet claimed strong demand for its vertically integrated AI portfolio will create new opportunities for Google Cloud across its product portfolio. Out of the 37 analyst ratings given to GOOGL stock, 29 are Buys, eight are Holds, and none are Sells, indicating a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average GOOGL stock price target is $165.28, indicating upside potential of 6.7% from current levels. Analysts tracking GOOGL stock expect adjusted earnings to expand from $5.80 per share in 2023 to $6.81 per share in 2024 and $7.85 per share in 2025. So, priced at 22.8x forward earnings, Google stock is not too expensive, even though it trades at a higher multiple than peers, as its bottom line is forecast to grow by more than 15% annually in the next two years.  Alphabet is a company firing on all cylinders. Despite its massive size, the tech behemoth continues to grow revenue and earnings at an enviable pace while improving profit margins. Additionally, its investments in AI should equip Alphabet with the resources to gain traction in the highly disruptive market over time. Disclosure\n",
      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips The Metaverse is one of the most exciting concepts today, promising unlimited possibilities in a fully accessible virtual environment. While it will likely take many years before it becomes a reality, investors can begin to seek out the best Metaverse stocks to buy in April to profit the most from what could become a worldwide phenomenon. The stocks listed represent companies with technology and software that put them in a fantastic position to profit immensely from the emergence of the Metaverse. In the long term, as the Metaverse inches closer, these stocks will grow along with the Metaverse. Let’s learn more about the specific offerings these companies will bring to the table, making them the best Metaverse stocks to buy in April. What makes the Metaverse so appealing to the world is the potential to create and share ideas and content that could never exist in reality. To make this possible, the Metaverse will need software like Cloudflare (NYSE:NET) and its top-rated Content Delivery Network (CDN). Sharing peak speed and performance is essential to making the Metaverse what it needs to be.  In addition to content delivery, Cloudflare offers two other indispensable pieces to the Metaverse puzzle: security and storage. Cloudlfare’s zero-trust security solution provides traffic control and data protection to a vast network worldwide. The sheer size of the Metaverse and all its data will require a massive storage system. Cloudflare is also positioned to become a secure storage option with its enormous R2 storage solutions compatible with its CDN. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a leading cloud computing software provider, and its product is Microsoft Azure. Azure provides users everywhere with access to applications of all kinds in a 100% virtual network. The Metaverse relies on the ability to present creative capabilities to users that are not possible anywhere else. The best way to do so is to utilize generative AI to expand the limits of content creation immensely. Microsoft is setting itself up to be the backbone of providing this service on such a scale through a multi-year, multi-billion dollar partnership with OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT. OpenAI is at the forefront of generative AI, and this partnership ensures it uses Azure exclusively for its cloud computing needs.  To further its position as a key piece of the Metaverse, Microsoft has solidified itself in another relevant field: gaming. Gaming, specifically VR games, will undoubtedly contribute to Metaverse demand. To set itself at the forefront of gaming, Microsoft recently completed its acquisition of Activision Blizzard, a world-renowned gaming company. Meta (NASDAQ:META) is leading the Metaverse and investing heavily in its development. Reality Labs is part of Meta and is responsible for developing VR technology and software. Reality Labs offers VR hardware, such as the Oculus VR headset and Ray-Ban smart glasses. Though sales have not been ideal for these products, they continue to perform better than similar products on the market. Meta continues to lead the charge, investing billions more than competitors in VR software. Though Meta has suffered losses over the previous year, its investment in the future and the Metaverse is unmatched. When the Metaverse takes off, you can bet that Meta will be the first to benefit, and investors with faith in VR’s potential should start with this stock.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips While the idea of digital immersion might seem suited exclusively for video games, that’s not necessarily the case, boding well for virtual reality stocks. And even the innovation centered only on entertainment, that’s not a bad place to be. According to Grand View Research, the video game market reached a valuation of $217.06 billion in 2022. By 2030, the sector could print revenue of $583.69 billion, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.4%. For VR, the sector could be worth $435.36 billion, representing a CAGR of 27.5% from 2023. Stated differently, you ignore this space at the risk of incurring an opportunity cost. With that, below are three virtual reality stocks to consider. Formerly known as Facebook, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) apparently got tired owning the world’s largest online social network. As a result, the company has shifted its focus aggressively on the metaverse. A lot of folks make this concept more difficult than it needs to be. It’s really a virtualization medium that allows users to interact with others in a computer-generated environment.  Now, I’ll freely admit that some of Meta’s metaverse proposals are a bit out there. Case in point is the office virtualization thingy, which in my opinion is dystopian: just go to the darn office already! However, if I remove my bias, I can acknowledge that there’s plenty of potential in terms of utilitarian connectivity protocols. What matters most regarding virtual reality stocks, though, is performance. Last fiscal year, the company beat all its quarterly bottom-line targets. Its best print came during the third quarter, when earnings per share of $4 beat the target of $3.31. For the current fiscal year, analysts are looking for EPS of $20 on revenue of $158.25 billion. That’s a massive improvement over last year’s results of $14.87 EPS on sales of $134.9 billion. A gargantuan player in the software department, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) shows no sign of curbing its ambitions. It’s really a leader across multiple innovation categories, including artificial intelligence. As a result, it’s not surprising that it ranks among the top virtual reality stocks. In particular, I see huge potential for its mixed reality headset called HoloLens. To be fair, it’s not a pure-play VR solution. However, Microsoft is pushing the boundaries of what is possible, integrating the best virtualization technologies and juxtaposing them with real-life protocols. With HoloLens, workers in technical and critical fields – let’s say heavy machinery and medical care – can receive invaluable training. And they can also receive guidance in an environment where mistakes won’t have deadly consequences.  Financially, Microsoft is a handy lead-off batter. It doesn’t really hit home runs but it gets on base. That’s important for winning games over a long season. For fiscal 2024, analysts project EPS of $11.65 on revenue of $244.22 billion. That’s a big improvement over last year’s result of $9.81 on sales of $211.91 billion. As a multinational semiconductor contract manufacturing and design company, Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) is not a pure-play candidate for virtual reality stocks. However, VR applications and hardware won’t get very far with advanced computer chips. Indeed, as The Wall Street Journal argued, a case can be made that TSMC is the world’s most important company. Ultimately, any high-powered application or protocol – whether it be generative AI or VR – requires incredible processing capacity. TSMC provides the computing power necessary to move the world’s latest and greatest tech advancements. Should VR expand in scope and scale (which is what’s happening), TSM stock should continue charging higher. Notably, it’s up over 38% this year. For fiscal 2024, analysts believe EPS will land at $5.76. That’s up noticeably from last year’s print of $5.19. On the top line, they’re calling for revenue to reach $84.34 billion, up 21.5% from last year’s result of $69.4 billion. Given how important TSMC is to not only VR but other innovations, it’s easily a name to consider.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Certain stocks are hidden gems in investing because they can provide considerable returns and expand a portfolio to hit the million-dollar mark. Here, seven companies offer appealing returns based on solid fundamentals. To be specific, the first one has a growing client base. The company’s impressive increase in client accounts indicates a rising user base and confidence in its services, which paves the way for long-term leads. Meanwhile, the second one has an extensive user network. The company has a far larger potential for revenue generation through advertising and other monetization routes based on its broad reach throughout its family of applications. Moreover, the third one holds a solid lead in data center solutions. The company’s data center income has grown exponentially, indicating a growing need for accelerated computing capabilities, especially in AI-driven applications. Similarly, the remaining four have solid fundamentals. Exploring these seven companies’ growth potency and strategic positioning may help navigate the market’s intricacies and provide useful information for constructing a seven-figure portfolio.  Interactive Brokers (NASDAQ:IBKR) saw a 23% growth in customer accounts, reaching 2.56 million, compared to the same quarter last year. This increase in client base demonstrates the company’s capacity to draw in more traders and investors, which is crucial for maintaining long-term growth. Additionally, client equity increased by 39% year-over-year (YOY) to $426.0 billion. This is a considerable increase in the value of the assets consumers own on the Interactive Brokers interface. Hence, this expansion demonstrates the clients’ faith and confidence in the company’s products and services. Moreover, Interactive Brokers kept a solid $14.1 billion in total equity, demonstrating the strength and stability of its finances. The corporation can maintain its business operations, engage in growth plans, and weather market turbulence with a solid equity position. Overall, Interactive Brokers’ balance sheet maintained precise management as no long-term debt exists. Hence, this lowers the company’s risk exposure to interest rate swings and debt repayment obligations. Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, and other applications in Meta’s (NASDAQ:META) family of apps have a vast and intensifying user base.  For example, the average number of family daily active persons (DAP) in 2023 was 3.19 billion, reporting an increase of 8% over the previous year. Similarly, there were 3.98 billion family monthly active persons (MAP), reflecting a 6% YOY increase over 2022. In 2023, there were 2.11 billion daily active users (DAUs) on Facebook, a 6% YOY boost. Lastly, Facebook reported 3.07 billion monthly active users (MAUs), up 3% YOY. As a result, these indicators reflect Meta’s expanded reach. Its user base constantly expands, offering a sizable market for its offerings. Overall, Meta’s fundamental capability to engage people across its platforms is demonstrated by the increase in both daily and monthly active users. This is vital in deriving top-line growth through advertising and other monetization tactics. The data center division of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has become a core source of top-line growth. The revenue is growing both YOY and sequentially. The considerable boost in revenue from data centers reached $18.4 billion in Q4 2024 and $47.5 billion in fiscal 2024. This highlights the solid market for NVIDIA’s accelerated computing solutions. Moreover, there was a remarkable 409% YOY increase and 27% sequential growth in Q4. This demonstrates the strong momentum and quick uptake of NVIDIA’s Data Center platform. The growing use of AI-based applications across sectors drives the need for NVIDIA’s Hopper GPU computing platform and InfiniBand networking solutions. Furthermore, Nvidia’s strategic focus on meeting the changing computing demands of cloud service providers, GPU-specialized businesses, and corporate software suppliers is reflected in the growth in data center revenue. Therefore, NVIDIA may lead the era of accelerated computing and generative AI by providing adaptable and high-performance solutions, supporting its potential for additional growth.  Disney (NYSE:DIS) projects sharp cash-generating capabilities, with $8 billion in FCF expected in fiscal 2024. FCF is crucial to financing expansion plans, increasing the company’s financial standing, and returning capital through dividends and share repurchases. FCF generation and growth investment logically relate to Disney’s capacity to use money wisely to fuel further growth. Disney can drive long-term development by investing in strategic projects like content generation, technological innovation, and worldwide expansion. These are all made possible by its solid free cash flow. Disney’s dedication to growth is demonstrated by its goal to invest over $60 billion in its company over the next ten years. Within that, roughly 70% will be allocated worldwide for incremental capacity expansion projects. Disney is positioned for development prospects, especially in its parks and experiences business. This is based on strategic investments in capacity expansion and improved experiences. Finally, Disney can maintain its growth momentum and provide higher valuations by producing and reinvesting considerable FCF. Therefore, FCF and growth investment have a mutually beneficial correlation that helps to promote long-term growth and profitability. Warner Bros. Discovery’s (NASDAQ:WBD) direct-to-consumer (DTC) division had strong growth during Q4 2023, contributing considerably to the company’s top-line growth. After Q4, Warner Bros. Discovery reported 97.7 million global DTC subscribers, including 1.3 million members from the BluTV purchase. Warner Bros. Discovery has attained market share in the very competitive streaming space, and its remarkable subscriber increase highlights this.  In addition, Warner Bros. Discovery’s global DTC average revenue per user (ARPU) reached $7.94 in Q4, up 7% (excluding FX) over the previous quarter. This boost in ARPU demonstrates Warner Bros. Discovery’s fundamental capability to progressively monetize its subscriber base and derive more value from its DTC services. Finally, the increase in DTC subscriber numbers and overall income demonstrates Warner Bros. Discovery’s leadership in the industry and flexibility in responding to shifting demands. All things considered, Warner Bros. Discovery is in a solid position to increase top-line growth and boost its client base by taking advantage of the rising demand for streaming content. The capacity of Philip Morris or PMI (NYSE:PM) to increase its market share indicates its competitiveness and efficiency in seizing market opportunities. The increase in market share shows that consumers strongly prefer PMI’s goods over its rivals. This supports the company’s total top-line growth and leadership in the industry. For 2023, Philip Morris’s market share for heated tobacco units, or HTUs, in IQOS markets climbed by 1.2 percentage points to 9.1%. ZYN also saw increased retail value and category volume share in the US. Moreover, Philip Morris’s focus on innovation is further demonstrated by the progressive launch of IQOS ILUMA in several regions, which covers more than 95% of IQOS geographies by volume. Furthermore, PMI’s dedication to ethical business practices is demonstrated by its sustainability performance. This includes its engagement in carbon disposal programs and sustainability indices. Finally, Philip Morris’s emphasis on sustainability and innovation demonstrates its proactive approach to satisfying customer wants while tackling social and environmental issues. PMI promotes growth and builds its brand value and reputation through long-term investments in cutting-edge goods and environmentally friendly operations.  Intel’s (NASDAQ:INTC) alliance with United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC) and its agreements with other industry participants reflects its edge in growing its foundry business. These formations are essential to fabricating a solid ecosystem around Intel’s foundry services and propelling fundamental growth in the foundry sector. Additionally, Intel has focused on boosting its foundry capabilities and meeting demand for advanced semiconductor manufacturing solutions. This can be observed in its partnership with UMC to build a 12-nanometer process platform. By utilizing UMC’s capabilities, Intel may expand its foundry portfolio and draw in more clients from various industry verticals. Furthermore, Intel’s strategic collaborations with Arm (NASDAQ:ARM), Synopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS), and other industry leaders aim to improve its foundry ecosystem and grow its client base. Through these arrangements, Intel’s partners may take advantage of Intel’s sophisticated manufacturing capabilities. Meanwhile, Intel may be gaining considerable intellectual property. Overall, Intel may build a solid ecosystem around its foundry business and spur more development and advancement by partnering with considerable industry elites.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Cryptos set to make millionaires are drawing attention as Bitcoin (BTC-USD) scales new heights in 2024 and the next halving approaches. After weathering the storms of 2022 and 2023, the crypto market is roaring. And will continue to do so until mid-April, when the reward for mining Bitcoin gets cut in half. This is not just conjecture; investors are flooding the asset class with cash, especially after the SEC approved 11 bitcoin exchange-traded funds, making cryptocurrencies accessible to a large number of new investors. However, we will explore some names other than the big two, Ethereum (ETH-USD) and Bitcoin, as diversification is important. First on the agenda is an asset with a unique approach to decentralized data storage, positioned for significant growth, potentially by as much as 217%. The second pick emphasizes privacy and anonymity at a time when global bodies tighten the noose around established cryptocurrencies. With its fast transaction speeds and privacy-focused features, Dash stands out in a competitive industry.  Finally, billionaire Mark Cuban recommends a pick, saying it’s superior to Bitcoin and Ethereum. Because it solves Ethereum’s scalability problems and improves interoperability, it makes a name for itself and is used for projects by numerous multinational companies. Filecoin (FIL-USD) aims to transform global data storage by substituting conventional cloud storage options with its decentralized storage network concept, leading to potential upside of 217%. One of the main reasons for the bullishness surrounding FIL is its exposure to the cloud storage market. Although estimates will vary, one forecast is particularly bullish. The market, per Fortune Business Insights, will expand from approximately $132 billion in 2024 to about $665 billion by 2032 at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 22%; nothing to scoff at. Separately, Filecoin is a “green coin” as it relies on a consensus mechanism based on valuable output, known as proof-of-useful-work. It reduces the energy waste that basic proof-of-work blockchains frequently experience. Filecoin is compatible with the Ethereum blockchain and other Web3 technologies, such as decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Again, I take estimates with a pinch of salt in the crypto space. However, the DeFi market is predicted to grow 39.5% to reach $70.3 billion between 2022 and 2027, BCC Research estimates. A separate analysis says the NFT space will grow from $36 billion in 2023 to $217 billion in 2032.  Notably, Filecoin is also partners with Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), working together to explore the potential applications of blockchain technology in space exploration, giving FIL an air or legitimacy other crypto assets lack. The collaboration intends to send a node of the Interplanetary File System (IPFS) into orbit. In addition, Filecoin is handling more than two million gigabytes of data and introducing the Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM). Furthermore, the launch of the FIL-RetroPGF-1 programme awarded 200,000 FIL to network contributors as a prize. The action demonstrates Filecoin’s dedication to community involvement by providing incentives for investment and participation in the network. Dash (DASH-USD) is the product of a Bitcoin hard fork. Thanks to its focus on anonymity, it distinguishes itself among cryptos set to make millionaires. The unique selling point for Dash comes down to one word: privacy. Most people tend to forget that the main thrust of cryptocurrency is to escape government oversight. However, many times, things do not go the way they originally intended. Governments everywhere are trying to impose some sort of legal control on major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Bitcoin. Particularly noteworthy for its assertive approach to the cryptocurrency market is the U.S. Security & Exchange Commission. It filed lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN).  Moreover, 98% of the world’s GDP, or 134 currency unions and countries, are considering a central bank digital currency. The IRS already categorizes cryptocurrency as property, so Bitcoin income and profits are subject to taxation. All of these developments build the investment case for Dash, which emphasizes privacy through its PrivateSend feature. The system will take one transaction and then jumble it up with others, making it difficult to trace. Initially introduced as XCoin in 2014, DASH uses a dual-layer network architecture delineating miners from ordinary users. It features distinctive technologies such as InstantSend and ChainLocks. DASH sets a new benchmark for speedy transactions with its InstantSend feature, which guarantees nearly instantaneous confirmations and facilitates the quick sending and receiving of DASH coins. ChainLocks, on the other hand, enhances the DASH network’s security by stopping 51% of attacks.  Altogether, a combination of fast transaction speeds and anonymity helps DASH stand out in a crowded marketplace of cryptos set to make millionaires. Polygon (MATIC-USD) finishes off this list because it performs a very important function: solving Ethereum’s scalability challenges. Polygon’s value proposition is rather clear-cut and basic. It improves interoperability across blockchains and provides quicker, less expensive transactions. Its Layer-2 network status expands its possible use cases, enabling improved interoperability and fast transactions. By offloading traffic from the main blockchain onto Ethereum sidechains, Polygon lowers transaction costs and congestion. Unlike Bitcoin, which is simply a store of money, Polygon can allow a wide range of applications. The platform is notable for its mushroom growth in the DeFi sector. The growth in decentralized finance solutions is hard to measure. One estimate says the industry will be worth over $231 billion by 2030, an astounding CAGR of 46%​ between 2023 and 2030.  Because of all these factors, notable investors like Mark Cuban are bullish on Polygon. The billionaire admires Polygon more than Bitcoin and Ethereum, giving it a substantial public endorsement. In addition, several companies have partnered with Polygon, such as Nike, Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), Mastercard (NYSE:MA), Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), Disney (NYSE:DIS) and Meta (NASDAQ:META), among others. The purpose of each partnership is different, illustrating the wide range of use cases for Polygon’s platform. Meta, for example, used Polygon for non-fungible tokens or NFTs. Nike partnered with Polygon to create a digital marketplace for NFTs and digital fashion items. Meanwhile, Mastercard launched a web3-focused incubator with Ethereum scaling layer-2 blockchain Polygon. The institutional support places it well among cryptos set to make millionaires out of investors in this halving season.

The legislation, now known as the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Application Act, was forwarded by the U.S. government Reps. Mike Gallagher (R-WI) and Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-IL) on March 5. On March 7, the legislation garnered approval from the Energy and Commerce Committee, as it has been concerned over TikTok’s control by a foreign adversary. As TikTok’s parent company, the bill is to compel ByteDance to sell its stake. Such legislation could lead to the app’s disappearance within six months in the United States. However, the bill also faces challenges in the Senate, which needs to it through to the president before it becomes an official law. Moreover, problems like TikTok’s close ties to China also loom in, adding more reason for lawmakers to ban the app due to possible security risks. Such risks include alleged data spying by the Chinese government. Although TikTok’s assurance of data protection, such as its very own Project Texas, is known, suspicion of user privacy is still a big concern for many in the U.S. government. While ByteDance has assured the public’s worries about data privacy and social media impact are unfounded, analysts still see that targeting TikTok for a ban is not a full solution.  In fact, whether foreign or domestic companies, such agencies have avenues to access sensitive information from the U.S. through digital trade. Therefore, sanctioning only one app will not address broader issues. The bill proceeds to the Senate amid uncertainty, with senators divided on its fate and previous attempts to ban TikTok stalling. A TikTok spokesperson criticized the secretive process, hoping the Senate would consider the impact on the economy and millions of users. TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew conveyed disappointment, stating the bill favors rival social media firms and harms creators and small businesses. Chew assured users of TikTok’s ongoing efforts to safeguard their data and platform integrity. He highlighted the potential consequences of the legislation, expressing TikTok’s commitment to legal action to protect its platform. President Biden, previously an advocate for the bill, pledged to sign it if passed, with the White House offering technical assistance in its development and passage through Congress. Despite House members asserting that the bill doesn’t ban TikTok, it mandates ByteDance divest the app within six months to keep it available in the United States. If passed, app stores and internet hosts would be barred from supporting TikTok and ByteDance-related apps. Lawmakers cited national security risks due to alleged ties to the Chinese Communist Party, claims refuted by Chew during congressional hearings. However, organizations like the ACLU and Knight Institute oppose the bill, fearing it infringes on First Amendment rights. Trump expressed concerns that banning TikTok would benefit Meta (NASDAQ:META).  Donald Trump’s remark, labeling Facebook an “enemy,” stood out, given his past efforts to remove TikTok over national security concerns. In 2020, his administration urged ByteDance to divest the app, prompting Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to consider acquisition. If the TikTok bill passes, Angelo Zino suggests its U.S. operations could be valued at over $60 billion. Zino speculated that ByteDance might opt to cease TikTok operations in the U.S. Keith Rabois, a notable venture capitalist, warned against Republicans opposing the TikTok legislation. TikTok creators explored diversifying their brands amid the looming ban. Upon joining TikTok before the Super Bowl, President Joe Biden’s inaugural post sparked interest, dissected by political scientist Maggie Macdonald for its self-awareness. Biden’s entry into the platform amid debates over TikTok’s presence in the U.S. underscored its dual role: a campaign tool and a security concern. The House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party proposed a bill mandating ByteDance to divest TikTok, threatening a U.S. ban. The bill advanced to the House floor following a unanimous 50-0 vote. Rep. Troy Balderson labeled TikTok a CCP surveillance tool, while Mr. Chew refuted any connections. TikTok criticized the move, citing potential infringements on free expression and economic impact. Since Biden’s lighthearted debut, his TikTok campaign amassed 274,700 followers and 3.2 million likes. As he faces a tight race against Trump, Biden aims to engage younger voters, crucial for mobilizing traditional Democratic support. Social media expert Aaron Earls emphasized Biden’s direct voter interaction for increased youth turnout.  During the State of the Union address, the president’s team shared speech clips on TikTok, signaling his commitment despite legislative concerns. White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre endorsed the bill, emphasizing outreach while ensuring national security measures. Biden pledged to sign if Congress approves. TikTok rallied users after the bill’s House advancement, prompting calls to lawmakers’ offices. The Senate’s stance on the bill remains to be determined. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) hasn’t committed to scheduling a vote despite bipartisan House support and the White House urging for prompt action. Senate processes typically move slower, and senators are set for a two-week break. Sen. Mike Rounds (R-SD) doesn’t anticipate immediate action, while Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-ND) suggested a prolonged timeline. The Senate Commerce Committee currently holds the bill, where similar proposals have stalled. Still deciding the legislation, the group’s chair, Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA), mentioned the possibility of a hearing and potential revisions. Cantwell emphasized the need for constitutional adherence but didn’t outline a timeline. Critics argue the bill infringes on the free speech of TikTok’s 170 million users, prompting calls for careful consideration from lawmakers like Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR). Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), the leading Republican on the Senate Commerce Committee, urged Chair Cantwell to schedule a markup swiftly. Cruz highlighted the need to discuss the bill’s language and potential amendments. However, the bill’s fate remains to be determined in the Senate, with Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA) expressing uncertainty about the timeline for any related legislation. If the House bill clears the Senate and gains presidential approval, it will be enacted into law. The legislation would then force ByteDance to face a TikTok ban within 180 days if it doesn’t sell its interest. However, for users doing business on TikTok, the bill could pose some financial and regulatory dilemmas.  Mr. Chew also addressed some challenges during discussions with U.S. lawmakers. He remarked that complying with the bill’s requirements was impractical and would ban the app nationwide. Previous attempts to restrict TikTok broadly in the U.S. failed, such as Montana’s ban, which a federal judge deemed unconstitutional. Calli Schroeder, a senior counsel at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, views attempts to ban TikTok as mere “security theater.” Legislators push such measures to appear proactive despite knowing they don’t tackle the core issues. Banning TikTok wouldn’t substantially impact China’s access to American data. While TikTok is already prohibited on federal and state-issued devices in many states, previous attempts like Montana’s ban faced legal challenges due to constitutionality and freedom of expression concerns. Kate Ruane, an attorney at the Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT), emphasized that banning TikTok won’t enhance data security. Numerous apps, including those owned by Chinese companies like WeChat and Alipay, also collect and distribute user data globally. Anne Toomey McKenna, a cyber law and privacy professor, suggested that singling out TikTok seemed more like political theater than adequate data security and privacy legislation. Numerous foreign and domestic tech companies, including LiveRamp (NYSE:RAMP), gather vast amounts of user data and then trade it globally by third-party brokers.  Data collection extends from smartphones and smart speakers to connected cars and dating apps. Social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram may appear free, but users pay with their data. These anonymized data, theoretically used for targeted advertising, often contain detailed personal information. A study found about 2,230 companies shared users’ data with Facebook. Governments worldwide, including the U.S., leverage these data markets to access extensive personal information without traditional legal processes. According to Politico, the Federal Trade Commission probed TikTok and ByteDance for misleading U.S. users about data access by individuals in China. Alleged violations of children’s privacy laws were also investigated. With the Justice Department, the FTC may litigate or negotiate a settlement. Even if the Senate approves the bill, TikTok plans to explore legal options before considering selling its U.S. operations. Former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin expressed interest in assembling a group to buy TikTok. However, major tech firms like Meta and Microsoft may refrain due to antitrust concerns. Any sale would also need Beijing’s approval, and the buyer might not gain access to TikTok’s proprietary algorithm. TikTok investors eye an IPO, but its value could decrease if it exits the U.S. market.

      "(RTTNews) - Tech major Microsoft Corp. plans to invest $2.9 billion in data centers in Japan by 2025 to boost its artificial intelligence or AI business, Nikkei reported citing an interview with President Brad Smith. The company will announce its investment plans when the Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is visiting the United States. Microsoft, which is the major investor of OpenAI, the developer of highly popular generative AI chatbot ChatGPT, will install advanced AI semiconductors at two existing sites in eastern and western Japan. The company also plans to announce an AI-related reskilling program in the country to train 3 million workers over three years. The company also plans to conduct joint research with universities on automation technology.  The firm would set up a new lab in Tokyo for research and development on robotics and AI. Microsoft Research Asia will set up the new lab and will provide 1.5 billion yen or $9.9 million to both the University of Tokyo and a partnership between Keio University and Carnegie Mellon University to fund research projects over the next five years. In the interview, Smith said the adoption of AI and investments in domestic capability has become a critical national priority for governments around the world. According to him, AI is essential to sustain productivity growth, even when a country has a declining population. Smith further said that the company will also partner with the Japanese government to strengthen cybersecurity resilience. Smith said, \"The threat landscape for cybersecurity has become more challenging. We're seeing that from China and from Russia in particular, but we're also seeing growing ransomware activity around the world.\" He noted that a close partnership between leading tech companies and the government is one of the keys for protecting cyberspace.  The news comes as Japan, which has restricted the transfer of personal data to overseas data centers, is launching new measures to add more AI computing power in the country. Amazon Web Services or AWS and Google have announced major investments in data centers in Japan.\n",

      "In major news on Hong Kong stocks, NetEase (HK:9999) shares surged by 4.1% on Tuesday following reports that 14 new imported games were approved by China in April. In 2023, China’s gaming regulator, the National Press and Publication Administration (NPPA), green-lit a record number of 1,075 new games, indicating robust support for the industry’s expansion. NetEase stock has been navigating a rollercoaster ride amid the changes in Chinese regulatory policies. Earlier in December, NetEase and Tencent Holdings Limited (HK:0700) lost a significant portion of their stock values when Beijing announced tougher guidelines on online gaming. The new regulations came as a big blow to the gaming industry players, disrupting their earlier recovery and robust growth. Later on, shares rebounded as regulators eased their stance on these proposals. In the last 12 months, NTES shares gained around 12% in trading. NetEase is a technology company specializing in the development of online PC and mobile games, smart devices, e-commerce platforms, and more. The upward momentum in NetEase shares on Tuesday was also supported by local reports indicating that the company was in discussion with Blizzard Entertainment, part of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), to reintroduce Blizzard’s games to the Chinese market, after a hiatus of over a year. Blizzard and NetEase failed to renew their agreement in 2022, resulting in Chinese gamers losing access to the former’s games in early 2023. With a potential deal, NetEase’s revenues are expected to benefit from publishing Blizzard’s highly popular games in China. NetEase stock has shown some recovery in 2024, with a year-to-date gain of 8%. Moving forward, analysts remain bullish on the stock, citing its gaming revenue growth, driven by successful existing titles and an exciting pipeline of new games. In Fiscal 2023, the company’s net revenues from the games and value-added services segment amounted to ¥81.6 billion, compared to ¥74.6 billion in the prior year. Notably, mobile games accounted for approximately 75.2% of earnings of this segment, up from 67% in 2022.  On TipRanks, 9999 stock has received a Strong Buy rating, backed by all four Buy recommendations. The NetEase share price target of HK$231 implies an upside of about 53% from the current level.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips After a big run to start the year, Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock looks to have stalled. But don’t worry. It likely won’t be long before the rally in the chipmaker continues. In the last month, NVDA stock has dipped 5%. The stock has struggled to rise above $950 per share and has retreated each time it hits that level. However, the current pullback comes after Nvidia had a huge run in January and February. Year to date, the stock is up 83% and a leader in the S&P 500 index. The current dip is likely only a temporary breather before NVDA stock again runs flat out. As such, investors would be smart to buy the dip. The rally in Nvidia’s stock that began in earnest at the start of 2023 has pushed the company to some important milestones. Earlier this year, Nvidia’s market capitalization crossed the $2 trillion mark and it is now the third largest publicly traded company in the world after Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). The company’s influence on the market is growing and the main catalyst for NVDA stock continues to be the company’s earnings. Since last summer, the stock market literally pauses in the days ahead of Nvidia’s earnings reports. It’s as if investors and traders are holding their collective breath to see if the company can exceed the lofty expectations that have been set for it. So far, Nvidia hasn’t disappointed and the entire market rallies after the company beats Wall Street’s forecasts. In February, Nvidia reported earnings that covered the final quarter of 2023 that crushed expectations and showed mind boggling growth at the microchip and semiconductor maker.  Fueled by unrelenting demand for its microchips and semiconductors among artificial intelligence (AI) companies around the world, Nvidia reported that its Q4 2023 sales rose 265% year over year, while its profits grew 769% from a year earlier. All metrics topped analysts’ estimates, and the guidance provided was even better. For the just completed first quarter of the year, Nvidia has forecast sales of $24 billion. If achieved, that would be up 234% from sales of $7.19 billion a year earlier. Can Nvidia do it again? There’s no reason to doubt the company at this point. The big question concerning Nvidia on Wall Street is how long can the company continue to exceed the sky high expectations that have been set for it? After all, the comparables the company faces are only getting tougher. At some point, Nvidia will fail to jump the bar that’s been set for its earnings and the stock will crash, right? Maybe not. Nvidia is continuing to pull out all the stops to stay ahead of its competitors and ensure that its earnings run at a blistering pace. In March, Nvidia unveiled its next generation AI microchips at a developer conference. Called the Blackwell series, the first of these new chips, the GB200, is the company’s most powerful technology to date. Specifically, the new GB200 chip includes what Nvidia calls a “transformer engine” that’s designed to run transformer based AI, one of the core technologies underpinning chatbots such as GPT-4. Nvidia is already receiving huge pre-orders from companies such as Microsoft and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). At the same time, Nvidia has signalled its intention to become less of a microchip provider and more of a platform provider going forward. To that end, the company introduced new revenue-generating software called Nvidia Inference Microservice (NIM) that it will charge a subscription fee for enterprise customers to access. And, Nvidia continues to expand globally, recently announcing plans to build a $200 million AI center in Indonesia as it grows throughout Asia. Nvidia currently controls about three-quarters (75%) of the AI chip market worldwide. That dominance shows no signs of decreasing. If anything, Nvidia’s market share is likely to increase as it begins to deliver its Blackwell series of microchips later this year. While the company’s earnings and stock have produced blockbuster gains over the last 18 months, there’s every reason to believe that the growth will continue. The bottom line is that Nvidia has the expertise and the products to remain the foundation of the AI revolution. For this reason, NVDA stock is a buy.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips With a keen eye for innovation and long-term growth potential, Bill Gates’ stocks often reflect a blend of stability and forward-thinking vision. While Gates himself does not actively manage the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation trust, its holdings offer valuable insights into his investment philosophy. Gates’ stocks are meticulously selected covering industries integral to economic growth. Whether focusing on established giants or burgeoning disruptors like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Gates’ influence in the investment world is undeniable. If you’re looking to invest for the long term, these worry-free investments can help you sleep peacefully at night. Now, let’s uncover the top three Bill Gates stocks to buy now! Microsoft is the largest company in the world and the cornerstone of Bill Gates’ investment portfolio. The company’s dominance is undeniable, with its Windows operating system powering billions of computers worldwide. However, the company’s leadership in generative AI and cloud computing is what will spearhead growth in the long term.  One of the most attractive aspects of Microsoft for long-term investors is the company’s wide moat and consistent revenue and EPS growth. The company boasts a healthy balance sheet, allowing it to remain nimble and invest in R&D to solidify its competitive edge in the marketplace. More recently, Microsoft has been making a huge push into generative AI. Integrations across Microsoft’s technology stack continue to drive Azure cloud deployments. Ultimately, that will be the key to powering Microsoft’s Copilot software as well as building, training and deploying AI applications. That makes Microsoft one of the top Bill Gates stocks to buy for 2024. Canadian National Railway (NYSE:CNI) might not be a name as familiar as Microsoft, but it plays a vital role in the North American economy. As the largest railway network in Canada, CNI is pivotal to global supply chains and transporting essential goods. Canadian National Railway’s extensive network spans more than 20,000 miles of track. That makes it a crucial component for the efficient movement of commodities and consumer goods. CNI boasts a long track record of profitability and operational efficiency, underpinned by its strong management team. Moreover, CEO Tracy Robinson is optimistic about the company’s ability to drive profitable growth. While revenue decelerated in FY23, management has guided 10% to 15% EPS growth over the 2024 to 2026 period. Its diversified revenue streams can help insulate it from market volatility, making it a noteworthy investment case for Bill Gates’ recession-resistant asset allocation strategy. Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) is a global leader in the construction equipment manufacturing industry. While cyclical in nature, the construction and mining sectors are essential for global infrastructure development. Caterpillar has been one of Bill Gates’ best investments since inception, up more than 500% since the foundation’s first purchase. As the largest construction equipment manufacturer in the world, the company has seen continued growth in its revenue and EPS. Although the company is highly cyclical, its strong liquidity coupled with key investments in R&D has paid significant dividends. That has allowed it to grow its dividend at a 10% CAGR over the last decade. In FY23, Caterpillar’s EPS increased 59% YOY to $20.12 per share. Additionally, the company saw a record FCF of $10.57 billion. With infrastructure investments on the rise, Caterpillar is one of the top Bill Gates stocks to buy and hold for the long term.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Blue-chip stocks offer more stability than most stocks. Corporations in this category are profitable, and some of them are still growing at good rates. While the year started off strong, March was a bit slower. The S&P 500 only gained 3% during the month while it gained 5% in February. An April upswing can move blue-chip stocks higher. It’s nice to see stocks move higher in one month, but investors should prioritize what a stock will look like after a few years. These blue-chip stocks exhibit promising signs that indicate they have more room for long-term gains. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has a steady record of outperforming the stock market and delivering gains for shareholders. The stock is up by 252% over the past five years and offers a 0.71% dividend yield.  The company’s dominance in cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and other industries has prompted many analysts to feel bullish about the stock’s long-term prospects. The average price target suggests an 11% upside. Microsoft is also rated as a “Strong Buy” among 35 analysts. The highest price target of $550 per share implies a 29% gain from current levels. Microsoft Azure continues to gain market share in the cloud computing industry. This major catalyst grew by 24% year-over-year in Q2 FY24 and contributed to more than half of Microsoft’s total revenue. Cloud computing has also helped Microsoft expand its profit margins. That has led to a lower P/E ratio and high dividend hikes each year. The rising demand of artificial intelligence should increase Microsoft Cloud’s runway. American Express (NYSE:AXP) is an enticing dividend growth stock thanks to its valuation, consistent financial growth, and high-profit margins. The stock has a 20 P/E ratio and a 1.26% dividend yield. American Express recently announced a 17% dividend hike amid good financial results in the fourth quarter of 2023. During that quarter, revenue increased by 11% year-over-year while net income jumped by 23% year-over-year. American Express also announced that it intends on generating 9% to 11% year-over-year revenue growth beyond 2026. The company also expects EPS growth rates to range in the mid-teens during the same time. These announcements are a part of the company’s growth plan which started in January 2022. American Express generated record revenue and profits in 2023 by adding 12.2 million new cards over the past year. The number of “cards-in-force” issued exceeds 140 million. People will use their credit and debit cards during any economic cycle. American Express offers more insulation than many corporations when the economy slows down.  Deckers Outdoor (NYSE:DECK) is an emerging athletic apparel brand that is stealing market share from top competitors. The company’s Hoka and Ugg brands have been a big hit with consumers. Revenue increased by 16% year-over-year in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 to reach a record $1.56 billion. The company’s fiscal 2024 revenue guidance suggests it will generate 14% more sales in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023. The company’s profits grew by 40% year-over-year and helped Deckers Outdoor secure a 25% net profit margin. Ugg has been doing most of the work and reached $1.072 billion in revenue during the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Hola came in second with $429.3 million in revenue but is growing at a faster rate. Ugg brand net sales increased by 15.2% year-over-year while Hoka brand net sales grew by 21.9% year-over-year. Deckers Outdoor has received more attention ever since it was added to the S&P 500. Even before its inclusion, the stock has comfortably outperformed the market by delivering a 480% gain over the past five years. Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) sells essential home care and grooming products that won’t go out of style during an economic bust. The stock has only delivered a 49% gain over the past five years which is below the S&P 500’s gains during the same time period. However, this blue-chip stock doesn’t experience as much volatility. PG stock only has a 0.43 beta compared to the S&P 500’s 1.00 beta. Beta is a measure of an investment’s volatility. While many growth investors want to forget 2022, Procter & Gamble only lost 7% of its value during that year. The company’s 2.41% dividend yield helped to offset some of those losses.  Speaking of the dividend, it’s one of the most reliable payouts in the market. Procter & Gamble has distributed dividends for 133 consecutive years. The includes 67 consecutive years of dividend hikes. Procter & Gamble has the flexibility to raise prices during inflation and reward long-term investors. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a dominant force in the e-commerce industry. Amazon’s vast logistics network makes it easy for most people to receive any product within 1-2 days. The tech giant also has same-day shipping available at some locations. The company has a deep moat for its online marketplace, and that competitive advantage resulted in record revenue in Q4 2023. Amazon increased its net sales by 14% year-over-year to reach $170.0 billion. Amazon grew its international revenue by 17% year-over-year while revenue from North America was up by 13% year-over-year. Amazon also has a competitive moat with its cloud computing platform. Amazon Web Services exhibited a 13% year-over-year growth rate to reach $24.2 billion. The company is also expanding into advertising, video streaming, and artificial intelligence. These growth opportunities can result in higher revenue growth and rising profit margins. This makes it one of those blue-chip stocks to buy. Amazon stock is up by 23% year-to-date and has plenty of fans on Wall Street. The average price target suggests a 13% upside. The stock is rated as a “Strong Buy” among 41 analysts.  Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is another blue-chip stock to consider after the social media giant has rented its focus on rising profit margins. Analysts have cheered on the company’s recent results and currently view the company as a “Strong Buy.” The highest price target of $609 per share suggests a 16% upside from the current price. The stock has been getting more attention due to its recent dividend. Meta Platforms announced its first dividend in the fourth quarter of 2023. The company also reported 25% year-over-year revenue growth and 201% year-over-year net income growth in that quarter. The dividend was the icing on the cake. Many advertisers flock to Meta Platforms to reach more of their potential customers. The company has a comfortable lead over other social networks. A TikTok ban would push Meta Platforms higher up on its pedestal. Meta Platforms doesn’t need a controversial TikTok ban to gain market share, but it is a catalysts that investors should monitor. Visa (NYSE:V) offers stability since many people will use credit and debit cards during various economic cycles. These plastic cards are more convenient than carrying around spare change and can also help with credit building (credit cards only) and have enticing rewards programs. You aren’t earning 2% cashback if you use paper cash for your purchases, and credit cards let you access money that you currently don’t have. These financial products can put you into a lot of debt, but they are useful for many people.  Visa has been using this formula to deliver impressive returns for shareholders. The stock has gained 7% year-to-date and is up by 74% over the past five years. Visa also has a 0.75% dividend yield and has a compounded annual growth rate of 18.18% over the past five years. The stock only has a 21.50% dividend payout ratio, which suggests it has plenty of room to increase its distributions. The fintech company also boasts solid financials. Visa reported 9% year-over-year revenue growth and 17% year-over-year GAAP net income growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. It’s one of those blue-chip stocks to consider.

      "(RTTNews) - Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, the developer of highly popular generative AI chatbot ChatGPT, has been added to the latest list of billionaires by Forbes with his vast investments in start ups and other companies. Meanwhile, he does not have a financial stake in the now $80 billion-plus valued non-profit artificial intelligence startup OpenAI, which he cofounded with billionaire Elon Musk and others in 2015. It is for the first time that Altman has been added to Forbes list of the world's richest people. In 2015, he was featured on Forbes' first-ever 30 Under 30 list for venture capital. As per a Forbes investigation report, the major share of Altman's wealth comes from startup investments in companies supported by technology startup accelerator Y Combinator Management, LLC. Altman's investments in YC companies include Reddit, fintech unicorn Stripe, nuclear energy company Helion as well as longevity startup Retro Biosciences, among others.  For adding him to the list, Forbes said it went through more than a dozen regulatory filings and spoke to many people familiar with Altman's investments that gave the most thorough estimate of his net worth so far to be $1 billion. Meanwhile, Forbes said it could not appraise Altman's personal collection of technological artifacts, such as jet engines and Bronze Age swords. Forbes cited Reid Hoffman, the LinkedIn cofounder and former longtime OpenAI board director, as saying, \"Sam is rare in that he's a capable investor, but he's also making bold bets. A lot of investors are fearful of failing. They invest in things that will make money, but aren't going to be potential big public failures. Sam is very comfortable with taking the big bet.\" It is said that Altman at the age of 8 learned to program and disassemble a Macintosh computer. In 2003, he enrolled at Stanford to study computer science, but dropped out to start location-sharing mobile app Loopt two years later. He participated in startup accelerator Y Combinator's first-ever cohort in Cambridge, Massachusetts. At YC, cofounder and president Paul Graham in 2009 included Altman on a list of the previous 30 years' five most interesting startup founders, along with Apple's Steve Jobs as well as Google's Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Altman, who had started investing from a young age, in 2010 invested in four companies. The next year, he became a partner at YC. In 2012, Altman sold Loopt for $43 million. That year, he launched a $20 million venture fund, Hydrazine Capital, under the mentorship of PayPal cofounder and billionaire Peter Thiel. The fund reportedly invested 75% of its capital into YC companies.  Altman in 2014 became the successor for Graham to run YC. As YC president for five years, he set up Continuity fund to keep investing in YC alumni companies as they grew, and also offered online courses for would-be founders and investors. In 2015, he cofounded OpenAI with Musk and others with a view to utilizing AI for the benefit of humankind. Microsoft Corp. is currently OpenAI's largest investor. Amid his growth as an investor, Altman in November last year was ousted by the OpenAI Board as its CEO, saying that he was not consistently candid in his communications. After Altman's exit, OpenAI's President and co-founder Greg Brockman also left the company in protest, and majority of OpenAI employees threatened to quit if Altman was not reinstated. Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft Corp., OpenAI's largest investor, then had informed that he was not given any explanation. However, after few days, Altman was reinstated to the company's chief role by its Board. In March this year, Altman rejoined its Board of Directors after an independent Special Committee investigation on his firing and related incidents found that his conduct did not mandate removal.\n"

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Many highly successful stock pickers, including Warren Buffett, often buy stocks on weakness.  That’s largely because companies that are great or are on their way to greatness often sink for reasons that are not at all justified. For example, on Feb. 21, Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) dropped to as low as $817.08 per share. Many investors wrung their hands about the stock’s valuation, even though it was not expensive, along with the firm’s decision to sell more shares of its stock. Of course, the latter decision ultimately did not greatly affect the company’s fundamentals. Anyone who bought the stock for just above $700 and sold it near its high of $1,033 on Mar. 28, a little over a month later, would have generated a profit of nearly 50% in a little over a month. So Buffett’s belief that investors should “be fearful when others are greedy and… be greedy only when others are fearful” does work. For those who want to profit from that philosophy, here are three stocks to buy on dips. Enphase Energy (NASDAQ:ENPH), which sells inverters used in solar energy projects,  tumbled over 10% on Apr. 5 compared to its highs on the previous day. The catalyst for the downturn was reportedly the decision by Chief Commercial Officer David Ranhoff leaving the firm “for personal reasons” effective Jun. 30.  But sometimes executives really do leave firms for personal reasons, and this may be the case for Ranhoof. Moreover, it’s unlikely that Enphase will badly be hurt by the departure of its chief commercial officer. The company probably has many highly capable sales managers who can adequately fill his shoes. And importantly, Nextracker (NASDAQ:NXT) CEO Dan Shugar said in February that “solar is unstoppable” and “the intrinsic economics of utility scale are phenomenal both in the U.S. and overseas. It has never been as favorable as it is.” Enphase is reeling from the weakness of residential solar in California due to regulatory changes in the state.  Also, excess inventories in Europe weigh on the stock. Those issues, though, are expected to be temporary. They should be dwarfed over the longer term by huge increases in the demand for solar energy by utilities. These increases will be driven, as I’ve noted in the past, by significant gains in electricity demand. By the end of this year, ENPH stock should be far above its current levels as a result of the latter trend. Consequently, ENPH is one of the best stocks to buy on dips. The market has penalized Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) stock after the firm announced on Apr. 2 after the market closed that its manufacturing unit’s operational losses increased to $7 billion last year from $5.2 billion in 2022. Further, the unit’s revenue declined 31% to $18.9 billion. In the wake of the admittedly discouraging news, INTC stock retreated about 15% from recent highs. But CEO Pat Gelsinger explained the firm was remedying bad decisions it had made previously that weighed down the manufacturing business. What’s more, Intel expects the unit’s operating losses to peak this year. Also noteworthy is that it predicted the unit will break even on an operating basis in 2027.  But the manufacturing unit’s backlog now exceeds $15 billion, and it secured a sizeable deal from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). There are also indications that INTC may soon obtain a meaningful commitment from Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). As a result, other tech firms impressed by Intel’s ability to win deals from two of the biggest names in the sector may sign contracts as well. I predict within the next 12 months the Street will start to be enamored with Intel again as the manufacturing unit’s backlog grows. Further, as I’ve previously noted, reviews of the company’s powerful artificial intelligence Gaudi chips have been quite favorable. The chips’ backlog reached over $2 billion by the end of last year. What’s more, the backlog is growing quite rapidly. Intel is expected to launch a greatly improved version of the chip later this year. American Superconductor (NASDAQ:AMSC) sells products used to regulate the flow of electricity. It serves multiple industries whose use of electricity or whose revenues are rapidly increasing. Specifically, AMSC has many customers that operate semiconductor plants, and the number of such factories is surging. The sector’s use of electricity is booming as AI proliferates rapidly. Similarly, the company has many customers in the mining and materials sector. That space is growing rapidly as metals prices jump and demand for their use in renewable energy products and electric vehicles rises.  The shares are down 13% from their March high of $15 and are changing hands at a forward price-sales ratio of three times.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips George Soros’ hedge fund is making big bets on stocks, though not nearly as big as those he made on global currencies. His biggest investment had been Splunk, a big data analytics firm. He owned 1.6 million shares worth $240 million, representing over 4.5% of the hedge fund’s total portfolio. However, Cisco just acquired the company last month (NASDAQ:CSCO). With an average buy price of around $141 per share, Soros has made a decent profit on the $157 per share acquisition price. What follows are the next three biggest George Soros stocks held in Soros Fund Management according to the latest 13F filing with the SEC. Soros is also gambling on small-cap stocks, which is making a strong comeback. He owns 1.2 million shares of the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSEARCA:IWM), the index that charts the 2,000 smallest stocks in the Russell 3000 index. There’s good reason to believe Soros is on the right track. Historically speaking, small-cap stocks handily outperform mid and large-cap stocks. In their book Investing in Small Cap Stocks, authors Christopher Graja and Elizabeth Ungar found that over the 75 years studied, small-cap stocks beat mid-cap and large-cap stocks 60% of the time. Small-caps have underperformed their larger brethren, but beginning last October, that began to change, and today, the Russell 2000 is edging higher than the S&P 500.  While the small-cap index does hold many tiny companies with market valuations in just the tens of millions of dollars, it also holds some large ones that stretch the definition of “small-cap.” The largest stock in the index is Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI), with a market cap of $55.5 billion. Microstrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) is the next biggest with a $24 billion valuation. As those two stocks have been amongst the market’s top performers over the past year, it’s unsurprising to see the iShares Russell 2000 ETF also doing well. With an $18 billion market valuation, AerCap Holdings (NYSE:AER) isn’t quite a small-cap stock either. But it is having a solid run higher. Shares are up 18% year to date and 57% higher over the last 12 months. The Irish aircraft leasing company capped a strong year with fourth-quarter revenue of $1.9 billion. However, that was just slightly under Wall Street’s forecast for $1.92 billion. Earnings, though, easily trounced projections, coming in at $3.11 per share versus a $2.45 per share consensus view. Soros Fund Management owns almost 2.5 million shares at an average buy-in price of just under $63 per share. That values his stake at $183.5 million, which is good for a 3.5% position in his hedge fund, with the stock trading at around $88 per share, which gives Soros a 40% gain on his holdings so far. Wall Street’s price target aligns with that valuation, but analysts see AerCap rising to $101 per share on the high side. The aircraft leasing company could go higher. CEO Aengus Kelly said, “Given the strong tailwinds that we see for demand for aircraft, engines and helicopters, we are confident about the outlook for AerCap in 2024 and beyond.”  The third stock Soros is making a large bet on is Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL), which holds a 3.2% position in Soros Fund Management. He owns 1.2 million shares worth $170.3 million. The tech giant is not one of his best performers, though. The tech giant’s shares are down 13% from his average buy price of $97. Alphabet has some mixed reviews from hedge fund operators. I noted two weeks ago that Jim Simons at Renaissance Technologies was buying the stock. Still, Paul Tudor Jones from Tudor Investments and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation sold off their respective stakes. It’s hard to bet against Alphabet, though. Google remains a monopoly in search of all but names only, with a 91% market share. Although Alphabet’s advertising revenue disappointed Wall Street earlier this year, it is also an election year. Hundreds of millions of dollars will be dumped into ad campaigns. Google will grab a large portion of those ad dollars. Also, Google Cloud is a fast-growing rival to Amazon‘s (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS and Microsoft‘s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure. It has outpaced both of them for several quarters, with other irons in the fire, including Waymo self-driving vehicles. Alphabet should not be counted out by any means.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips The technology sector is generally responsible for innovation and growth. Thus, it’s no surprise that it often produces highly valued stocks. Companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) are great examples of the sector. Yet, there are plenty of underestimated tech stocks poised for a breakout. Once these bargain stocks break out they tend to create instant value for investors. Fortunately, there are relatively easy ways to identify shares with such potential. Value metrics are an extremely useful tool, but they are not the only factors investors should consider when hunting for bargains. Thematic direction of markets and how a given stock fits such narratives should also be examined. Let’s take a look at three underestimated stocks poised for a breakout. Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) has undertaken an effort to rejuvenate its business and make it stronger in relation to recurring revenues. That’s the thrust of the logic behind its recent acquisition of Splunk.  The deal is expected to add $4.2 billion in annual recurring revenues to Cisco Systems. CSCO itself reported $25 billion in annual recurring revenues in the most recent year. The acquisition will better align Cisco Systems with the analytics and cyber security markets overall. That should be a boon to CSCO shares, which are generally viewed as a more conservative choice overall. Part of the reason Cisco Systems has undertaken such a transition is related to declining earnings and revenue in the most recent quarter. CSCO stock is a bargain based on its P/E ratio. It’s reasonable to anticipate that ratio will rise as more attractive software earnings enter the mix following the Splunk acquisition. Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is often one of the first stocks discussed when it comes to the confluence of tech and income. The chip manufacturer’s shares include a dividend yielding roughly 2%. Furthermore, Qualcomm is undervalued when it comes to price to free cash flow ratio. QCOM’s strong free cash flow implies several things. First of all, Qualcomm’s ability to produce such cash flows is particularly beneficial given that it does pay dividends. Further, it also suggests that the company has the cash on hand to operate after everything else is done. That allows the company the latitude to do as it pleases.  The point here is that Qualcomm’s cash position gives it the ability to seek growth. That means the company is one of a few that provides income and growth opportunities to investors. Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) is undervalued for the simple fact that it is making a push to provide for Nvidia. The company recently began mass production of high bandwidth memory chips for use in Nvidia’s most up-to-date AI chips. The South Korean firm’s rivals Samsung and SK Hynix have decided to work together to address Micron’s challenge. That admission was highly unprecedented and speaks to their fear Micron will establish an insurmountable early lead. Micron is ahead of both South Korean firms in terms of production and is in position to become an integral supplier to Nvidia. MU has a technological advantage over Samsung that could prove particularly beneficial. Micron is also better positioned from the perspective that it is a U.S. company. Firms located in the US will have an easier time in the lead up to the presidential election. for all of those reasons Micron is underestimated.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Most investors probably think of Walmart (NYSE:WMT) as a famous big-box retail store chain. Yet, I encourage you to think of Walmart differently in 2024. You can buy Walmart stock because you like to buy defensive names and collect dividends, but don’t overlook the company’s artificial intelligence connections. That’s right: I’m proposing that WMT stock is a technology stock as much as a defensive/dividend stock. When you discover how Walmart is getting involved in AI, you’ll surely rethink this old retail giant and grab a few shares for your portfolio. There are plenty of reasons to invest in Walmart today. Maybe you like to collect passive income; if so, you’ll surely be interested to know that Walmart recently hiked its annual dividend by 9%. Or, perhaps you like to invest in growth stocks. On that topic, Walmart’s same-store sales increased 4% year-over-year in 2023’s fourth quarter, beating the analysts’ consensus estimate of 3.12%. Walmart stock hit a record closing high price of $61.45 not long ago.  Now, I’ll add another reason to invest in Walmart: it’s actually an AI-tech company. In fact, the company’s Walmart Commerce Technologies division recently introduced an AI-powered logistics-technology product called Route Optimization. To put it simply, Route Optimization is Walmart’s proprietary route-planning software for shipping businesses. According to the Business Wire news release, Route Optimization uses “AI-driven software to optimize driving routes, pack trailers efficiently and minimize miles traveled.” This software reportedly enabled Walmart to eliminate “30 million unnecessary miles driven” and “bypass 110,000 inefficient paths.” Even beyond Route Optimization, Walmart is implementing AI technology. For example, the company’s executives claim that Walmart’s AI-powered search bar is driving an “increasingly significant” number of searches on the company’s app. Certainly, Walmart’s executives know that the company could use some help in developing AI technology. That’s why Walmart is turning to an AI leader, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). As you probably know by now, Microsoft has added AI functionalities to its Edge browser and Bing search engine.  As Barron’s reported, Walmart has teamed up with Microsoft to “develop proprietary AI technology.” That’s a smart move, and it should benefit Walmart’s bottom line in the long run. Specifically, Jefferies analyst Corey Tarlowe anticipates that “AI and automation can help Walmart generate about $20 billion in incremental earnings before interest and taxes by fiscal 2029.” So, what’s your favorite reason to invest in Walmart? Is it the dividend payments, or is it Walmart’s comparable-store sales growth? Or, maybe you like to buy momentum stocks, and WMT stock is definitely moving in the right direction. On top of all that, Walmart has a Microsoft partnership to develop AI technology. That’s a development you might have have expected. Yet, it shows that even an old company like Walmart can venture into new, future-forward areas. Therefore, if you’re looking for a high-confidence AI investment, feel free to add Walmart stock to your portfolio.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips While virtual reality has long been tied to the entertainment arena, the innovation has expanded in utility, making these strong buy VR stocks exceptionally compelling. At the end of the day, it comes down to the numbers. According to Mordor Intelligence, the VR market size is projected to reach a valuation of $67.66 billion in 2024. By 2029, experts believe that this segment could rise to $204.35 billion. If so, we’re talking about a compound annual growth rate of 24.74%. As the research firm pointed out, VR can be used for applications that go beyond video games. Teachers can provide immersive learning experiences while companies – especially those tied to critical industries – can train their workers in a safe, pressure-free environment. With myriad relevancies available, these are the strong buy VR stocks to consider. When it comes to immersive technologies, you can’t leave out Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). First, the company enjoys natural synergies through its data goldmine Facebook. As for direct relevance to strong buy VR stocks to consider, Meta has invested heavily in both the hardware and software components necessary to fully participate in the metaverse.  True to the theme of this article, Wall Street analysts rate META stock as a consensus strong buy. Among 43 experts, 40 of them rate shares a buy. It’s interesting, though, that two experts rate META a hold and one a sell. Overall, the average price target lands at $530.58, with the high-side estimate reaching $609. In fiscal 2023, the tech giant beat all its quarterly expectations for earnings per share. Its average earnings surprise came out to 9.78%. For the current fiscal year, experts are looking for EPS of $20 on revenue of $158.24 billion. These stats are well above last year’s print of $14.87 EPS on sales of $134.9 billion. Operating under the internet content and information subcategory, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) offers various products and platforms across the world. Per its public profile, the enterprise operates through Google Services, Google Cloud and Other Bets segments. It enjoys the advantage of effectively owning the Internet through its Google search engine. However, it’s very much one of the strong buy VR stocks to consider. To be clear, Alphabet is more geared toward the augmented reality side of the picture. Nevertheless, the key similarity between VR and AR is the leveraging of digitalization to improve experiences and/or productivity. Further, the global AR market itself could become an industry worth nearly $600 billion by 2030 It’s no surprise, then, that analysts rate GOOGL a consensus strong buy. Among 37 experts, 29 rate shares a buy while the rest say it’s a hold. Overall, the average price target land sat $165.28, with the high side hitting $180.  For fiscal 2024, analysts are looking for EPS of $6.81 on revenue of $342.31 billion. These are notable improvements over earnings of $5.80 a share on sales of $307.39 billion last year. Conducting business mostly in the realm of infrastructure software, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) really needs no introduction. One of the advantages that the company levers is that its business software is practically universal. If you want to get anything done – especially if need to collaborate with others – it’s almost essential to be fluent with Microsoft’s Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) offerings. Regarding its status as one of the strong buy VR stocks to consider, Microsoft has invested in its HoloLens mixed reality technology. What I appreciate about this innovation is that it has wide-ranging implications. In particular, companies in various critical industries can help train new employees in intensive functions. This way, learning is accelerated and if mistakes are made, employees can quickly learn from them. Overall, 33 out of 35 analysts rate MSFT a buy. The two contrarians are one hold and one sell. Moreover, the average price target comes in at $473.77. Notably, the high-side target calls for a per-share price of $550, implying nearly 32% growth potential. For fiscal 2024, analysts are seeking EPS of $11.65 on revenue of $244.22 billion. That’s up conspicuously from last year’s $9.81 EPS on sales of $211.91 billion.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Editor’s Note: This. article was previously published under the name “Investing in the Next Wave of Explosive AI Growth” in February 2024. It has since been updated to reflect the most recent data. So far this year, the world’s leading AI chipmaker – Nvidia (NVDA) – has made it abundantly clear that the AI Boom is here. And the party’s just getting started. The tech firm reported in February that its revenues rose more than 260% in the last quarter of 2023. And management also said that revenues will rise another 230% this quarter, too. That’s got the mainstream media and most investors obsessing over Nvidia’s hyperbolic growth.  Then, in March, the company kicked off its GPU Technology Conference (GTC) with a keynote speech from CEO Jensen Huang. Huang headlined his keynote speech with the launch of Blackwell — Nvidia’s next-gen chip architecture that will enable the creation of faster, smaller, and better AI chips. Meanwhile, the most important players in this industry – including Nvidia itself – have already moved on to the next big thing: something we’re calling AI 2.0. We’ve been following these developments for a while now. We’re confident it will be the next wave of major AI growth. And it seems it’s just now hitting its major inflection point. In fact, we just learned that Nvidia itself is betting big on this next iteration. And it isn’t alone.  Microsoft (MSFT) – the world’s largest AI company – is betting big on AI 2.0, too. So are OpenAI, the world’s most influential AI startup, Amazon (AMZN), Tesla (TSLA) and Samsung. Not to mention the world’s richest men, Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos. Right now, all are pouring millions of dollars into AI 2.0. That means it’s time for you to join in and bet alongside them. So, what exactly is AI 2.0?  The real-world application of AI technologies via humanoid robots. Yes, I’m talking about AI-powered robots like the ones you’ve seen in science-fiction movies like “iRobot.” This application may seem like a pie-in-the-sky dream. But humanoid robots are already in development. This new AI wave is here. Don’t believe me? Well, Nvidia also recently announced the introduction of the Project GROOT Foundation AI model, designed to enhance the performance of humanoid robots, alongside a new system-on-a-chip named Thor for robotic use. This move comes as notable companies such as OpenAI, Microsoft (MSFT), Tesla (TSLA) (more on that in a moment), Amazon (AMZN), and Intel (INTC) heavily invest in humanoid robot development. With Nvidia joining the fray, the advent of sophisticated robots appears imminent. And we’re head over heels for this compelling investment opportunity in AI robotics.  In fact, as I write, Tesla is busy developing a humanoid robot called Optimus. And already, it can do things like fold clothes, make eggs, exercise, and dance. Tesla sees a world in the not-too-distant future where these robots are everywhere, helping people all across the globe complete menial tasks like cooking, cleaning, organizing, and more. Elon Musk is even on record saying that in time, Optimus could be bigger than Tesla’s core vehicle business. And we don’t think he’s delusional. If he is, then it seems Jeff Bezos must be, too. The former Amazon founder and CEO is reportedly pouring $100 million into a humanoid robot startup called FigureAI.  Clearly, he sees a bright future for humanoid robots as well. And guess who else is investing in FigureAI? Bezos’ old company, Amazon. The titan is pouring $50 million into FigureAI. So is Microsoft, with a $95 million commitment to the startup – not to mention $50 million from Nvidia, too. Or how about OpenAI? The ChatGPT creator is already FigureAI’s biggest investor, and it’s throwing another $5 million into the firm. Plus, Intel (INTC) and Samsung are also reportedly investing in FigureAI right now as well. Folks, it seems the writing is on the wall.  You may think of AI-powered humanoid robots as a mere sci-fi concept. But as with the world’s most powerful people, the foremost AI innovators clearly think humanoid robots are the next frontier, too. They see them as AI 2.0. And they’re dedicating millions of dollars to create this tech right now. We believe we’re seeing this boom’s next evolution unfold right now. And that means it’s time to grab your slice of the pie. Find out how to do just that right now with a few of our favorite stock picks.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips This April, investors continue to chase after record-high growth stocks. While many of these companies offer pathways to wealth, many may be hurt by a coming economic shock. Thus, picking the right growth stocks to own before the Fed rate cut is important. Focus on growth stocks with solid fundamentals and skilled management teams. These companies promise substantial long-term returns despite occasional setbacks. Diversification and strategic placement can maximize wealth accumulation opportunities in portfolios. Here are three of the best stocks to buy as the Federal Reserve potentially steps back from its tight monetary policy stance and begins cutting. Baird recently upgraded Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) to outperform and raised their price target to $87. This upgrade was driven by positive operational trends, with Shopify showing steady growth in net active stores. This growth was notably seen in strategic sectors like Shopify Plus and international markets, bolstering the company’s long-term outlook. Indeed, I agree with the analysts that these segments will play a vital role in Shopify’s business strategy moving forward.  The firm’s revised e-commerce platform survey aligns with the company’s focus, prompting the price target adjustment. Analysts noted stable market conditions with revenue estimates slightly above consensus but profitability lagging. Shopify boasts a market cap of $96 billion, affirming its top e-commerce platform provider dominance. Despite a high price-earnings and price-sales multiple relative to previous results, investors are pricing in much better forward numbers. The company’s recent revenue growth of more than 26% and solid bottom-line growth support such a view. As the star of video conferencing during the pandemic, Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM) still wows the public with its AI innovations. Its most recent AI integration is the Zoom Workplace, an AI collaboration platform that helps workforces enhance teamwork. The launch includes features like Ask AI Companion, a refreshed app interface, and improvements to the Zoom Contact Center for improved customer engagement. Smita Hashim, Zoom’s product chief, emphasized the significant benefits of Zoom AI Companion in enhancing collaborative workflows. Introducing Zoom Workplace with AI Companion aims to address user needs by integrating core collaboration tools into a unified AI-powered platform, improving productivity and efficiency. The latest AI Companion features, including Ask AI Companion and Zoom Phone and Team Chat enhancements, offer added value at no extra cost. Following pressure from European regulators, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) announced a division of its Teams and Office bundles on Monday, relieving competitors. Despite struggles against Microsoft’s communication suite, Zoom saw its video chat app soar during the pandemic. Mizuho analysts suggest separating MS Teams may ease enterprise churn, recommending buying Zoom shares.  This past year was one of the best for semiconductor giant Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). The company saw excellent growth, leading to a stock price that surged 259%. The main catalyst behind this rise? A surge of interest in artificial intelligence and related companies. As the key purveyor of high-performance chips used by AI companies and those developing applications, Nvidia has absolutely been on a rocket ship higher. This year alone, the stock is up roughly 80%, signaling just how powerful investors see this company’s future earnings coming in. At its recent GTC conference, Nvidia unveiled its Blackwell chip, ushering in a new computing era. The architecture offers six transformative technologies, enabling real-time generative AI at significantly lower costs and energy usage. CEO Jensen Huang sees Blackwell as pivotal for industries like deep learning and quantum computing, driving AI’s widespread adoption. Aside from the tech sector, Nvidia has expanded into healthcare by collaborating with the startup Hippocratic AI. Hippocratic AI develops virtual agents using Nvidia’s technology to streamline patient care tasks like appointment scheduling and post-discharge follow-ups. Leveraging Nvidia’s Avatar Cloud and NIM microservices, Hippocratic AI aims to enhance its health-focused large language model. For those looking for AI exposure, Nvidia remains the best option in this space. And while its stock isn’t cheap, on a forward basis, its valuation isn’t insane either. This stock remains a buy until the company shows its growth is slowing.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips The Magnificent Seven stocks make up a large portion of the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100. The performances of these seven stocks can potentially make or break the stock market. While the Magnificent Seven is a relatively new name, the group is quite familiar. Investors may remember hearing about FANG and FAANG stocks for several years. Most of the stocks that made up FAANG are members of the Magnificent Seven. Corporations change over time and impact long-term investors. Some businesses that once achieved impressive growth rates aren’t living up to the Magnificent Seven stock club. However, these three giants are still delivering solid returns for investors, and it looks like they have more room to climb. Here are the best Magnificent 7 stocks to buy in April. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is becoming the largest artificial intelligence (AI) stock, in addition to Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). While Nvidia produces the chips, Microsoft has made acquisitions and investments left and right. The company is even making moves that resemble acquisitions to avoid regulators.  Microsoft isn’t only expanding through AI. The company also acquired Activision to strengthen its video game segment, which features Xbox. Gaming has been a benefactor for Microsoft, but the company makes most of its money from cloud computing. Microsoft Cloud revenue grew by 24% year-over-year (YoY)  in Q2 FY24. The segment generated $33.7 billion of the company’s $62.0 billion in revenue for the quarter. Microsoft’s overall business delivered an 18% YoY increase in revenue. Net income jumped by 33% YoY, bringing profit margins to 35.3% in the process. Microsoft is the largest publicly traded corporation and has exceptional long-term returns. The stock is up 245% over the past five years and has already gained 12% year-to-date. Nvidia has been another top-performing stock that looks like it can extend its rally. The company’s GPU chips continue to gain market share and have given the company a comfortable lead over its competitors. It’s hard to recall a time when a mega-cap corporation exhibited the same financial growth that Nvidia currently enjoys. The AI giant reported 265% YoY revenue growth and 769% YoY net income growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024.  AI spending will eventually slow down, but Nvidia is still likely to grow at a respectable rate in the years ahead. Investors shouldn’t expect triple-digit growth rates to last much longer. The stock currently trades at a 36-forward P/E ratio and is up 74% year-to-date. Profit margins have expanded dramatically since the AI boom. The company reported a 55.6% net profit margin to close out the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. Revenue and earnings growth rates from that quarter have outpaced the stock’s gains over the past year. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) has built the world’s largest online advertising network. Many people instinctively use Google to find information online. I certainly use Google when doing research for articles like this one. Some visitors click advertisements that display relevant information, and Alphabet has gotten very good at showing relevant advertisements for search queries. Once businesses use Google or YouTube Ads effectively, it’s difficult to leave. Shutting off an ad campaign means walking away from the steady leads and sales that those ads generate. Alphabet continued to grow its advertising segment in the fourth quarter of 2023. During that quarter, revenue increased by 13% YoY. While ads are the big storyline, Google Cloud has been gaining more market share in the cloud computing industry. That segment is also expanding its profit margins, which helped Alphabet report a 52% YoY improvement in net income.  The company’s stock is up by 152% over the past five years and 9% year-to-date.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips 2024 is shaping up to be a tumultuous year for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). The tech behemoth and smartphone market leaders had been forced to contend with stock price downgrades from banks following lower consumer demand, and now face a landmark lawsuit amid accusations of building an industry monopoly. Apple has firmly denied the allegations, but this has failed to stop comparisons being drawn between the firm and Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) behavior in the 1990s, which resulted in a lawsuit and requirements that the company modify its more monopolistic practices. On Wall Street, there’s already been some damage done to Apple’s stock price. The first quarter of 2024 saw AAPL tumble more than 8%, and the prospect of a costly reprimand could bring a fundamental change in the way that Apple operates which opens the door to stronger smartphone market competition. While the outcome of the lawsuit could hit Apple’s pockets, fundamental shifts in business operations could carry major ramifications for its market dominance. Should Apple be forced to make products more interoperable with other brands and provide more open services, consumers may be free to mix and match brands on an unprecedented scale. This may open the door to the following key smartphone stocks to grow into Apple’s market share:  Unlike Apple, Google parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL,NASDAQ:GOOG) has gotten off to a strong start in 2024, posting growth of around 10% in the first quarter. Back in Q4 2023, Alphabet reported its fastest quarter for revenue growth since early 2022, with sales accelerating 13% from $76.05 billion year-over-year. Despite this impressive expectation-beating performance, share prices briefly slipped due to weaker Google ad revenue. Recently, Alphabet’s stock rallied after reports suggested Google may be readying to put its artificial intelligence (AI) search services behind a paywall. Crucially, AI has been an area where Google has been quick to adopt while Apple’s interest in the emerging technology remained more hesitant. Not only could this offer a crucial fresh revenue stream for Alphabet, but it could also see AI services become a key feature of Google’s next generation of Pixel smartphones, which are readying for launch later this year. With Android as the closest rival of Apple’s iOS smartphone operating system, any challenges to the latter’s attempted smartphone industry monopoly will see Google’s market position improve. Additionally, should Apple be ordered to create cross-functionality throughout its range of smartphone products, we could see a surge in demand for Android products among iPhone users.  Another stock that outperformed Apple in Q1 2024 and could benefit from a de-monopolization of the smartphone market is South Korean firm Samsung Electronics (OTCMKTS:SSNLF). While Samsung experienced slow growth throughout the opening weeks of the year, the recent news that the tech giant could be in line to become a supplier to semiconductor leaders Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) saw a rapid 5% jump in stock value. Currently, Nvidia is testing Samsung’s new range of high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips in what may be a lucrative partnership. Samsung’s advantageous position in the global chip market recovery has seen the firm’s stock price grow of late, and many securities firms are forecasting an operating profit of over 5 trillion won ($3.7 billion) in Q1 2024, up significantly from the 640 billion won ($476 million) recorded one year prior. If these figures are achieved, they would represent Samsung’s largest operating profit since the third quarter of 2022. Samsung’s position in the smartphone market may be another cause for investor optimism in the wake of Apple’s ongoing difficulties. The firm recently revealed the Galaxy ring in January at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. With the Galaxy ring, Samsung is set to enter the smart wearables market while innovating beyond traditional smartphones.  Although it can be difficult to monitor the long-term consumer appetite for smart wearables, the fallout of Apple’s lawsuit could see the Galaxy ring win a new audience among iPhone users. Yes, Nokia ADR (NYSE:NOK) may be trading at just 5% of its market peak during the Finnish firm’s heyday at the turn of the century, but there’s still plenty for investors to be optimistic about for a stock that’s continued to defy expectations in recent years. In Q1 2024, NOKIA grew a healthy 4%, and the stock has recently earned the attention of meme investors who have sought to buy into Nokia through a sense of nostalgia and high retail investor sentiment. Despite the company’s enduring popularity, times have been tough of late for Nokia. Q4 2023 sales of 5.7 billion euros represent a 23% year-over-year decline, while operating profit dropped 27% year-on-year to 846 million euros. Nokia’s recent hardships have prompted a 600 million euro share buyback scheme in early 2024, and telecommunications operator cutbacks and a slowdown among investments in India have caused the company to forecast more difficulty over the year ahead.  These forecasts make Nokia a riskier opportunity for investors, but it’s important to note that the firm’s slowing sales have already been factored into the market, and it’s also worth highlighting that Nokia is continuing to win new admirers amid growing ‘dumb’ phone market sentiment. While it’s been hard for Nokia to compete with Android and iOS market leaders, the firm’s power of nostalgia is seeing more users opt for the app-free offerings of Nokia’s streamlined handsets. While the lure of Nokia’s meme stock status and ‘dumb’ phone popularity could help the company to outperform its expectations in 2024, it may depend on the firm’s relationship with HMD, which has long-manufactured phones for Nokia but may soon begin using its own branding. Either way, Nokia remains a stock that’s worth tracking as an unpredictable 2024 could deliver plenty of market twists and turns.

      "News broke recently that Google (NASDAQ:GOOL) was in talks with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to integrate its Gemini AI into iPhones. The deal would be a huge boon for Google as it would likely be very lucrative, while also enhancing the reputation of the company’s AI, which has previously been plagued with public image issues. For Apple, it would allow the company and its products to stay ahead of the AI curve. When OpenAI released ChatGPT 3 to the public at the end of 2022, it set off an arms race in Silicon Valley. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is partnered with OpenAI and is the current king of the hill; the company's stock is up almost 50% in a year. Apple and Google, on the other hand, have struggled to keep up. Google, in a rush to keep up with Microsoft, released its answer to ChatGPT, Bard. Rebranded to Gemini, Google's AI platform has been plagued with issues. Prone to hallucinations, the LLM has been a flop up to this point. Apple has fared even worse. The once-largest company lacks an AI platform altogether. How the innovative tech behemoth was caught so unaware can only be speculated on, but the damage to Apple's image is real. The company's stock is up less than 4% in a year while the market is up nearly 30%. Although the details are still being hammered out, a deal between these two companies would be a huge boost for both. Google's stock jumped 5% on the day the news broke and is up another 3% since. Apple's stock had a more modest 0.5% bump on the day but has continued to slide since, due to other bad news coming from the company.  For Google or Apple bulls excited by the news, Direxion offers the Direxion Daily GOOGL Bull 2X Shares (NYSE:GGLL) and the Direxion Daily AAPL Bull 2X Shares (NYSE:AAPU) which seek daily investment results, before fees and expenses, of 200% of the performance of the Class A shares of Alphabet Inc. and the common shares of Apple Inc., respectively. For the bears, Direxion offers the Direxion Daily GOOGL Bear 1X Shares (NYSE:GGLS) and the Direxion Daily AAPL Bear 1X Shares (NYSE:AAPD) which seek daily investment results, before fees and expenses, of 100% of the inverse of the performance of the Class A shares of Alphabet Inc. and the common shares of Apple Inc., respectively.

      "(RTTNews) - Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) has announced that it will be discontinuing support for Windows 10 from October 14, 2025. This means that users who wish to continue using the operating system securely will need to pay an annual fee. To help with this, Microsoft will provide Extended Security Updates (ESU) for Windows 10, which will start at $61 for the first year. However, the pricing for ESU will increase as time goes on, doubling to $122 in the second year and then doubling again to $244 in the third year. Any organizations that join the ESU program later will need to cover the costs for the period they missed. Businesses have three paid options to extend support: the traditional 5-by-5 activation key method, a cloud-based activation method, or activation included with a Windows 365 subscription. Microsoft is offering a 25% discount for organizations using a Microsoft cloud-based update management solution, bringing the cost of ESU to $45 per user for up to five devices in the first year. It's important to note that these solutions are only available for Commercial Organizations and EDU customers, with details for regular consumers to be disclosed later. Microsoft is advising users to make the transition to Windows 11 or Windows 365 and highlights the attractiveness of purchasing new PCs in most cases. The aim of ESUs is to facilitate a gradual shift to the new operating system. For regular customers, an extended security update paid program will be introduced closer to Windows 10's end-of-support date in October 2025. Final pricing and enrollment conditions will be announced as the end-of-support date approaches.\n",
      "HubSpot Inc (NYSE:HUBS) shares are trading higher on continued upward momentum following a report suggesting Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is in talks with advisors about a potential offer for the company. Piper Sandler analyst Brent Bracelin maintained HubSpot shares as Overweight with a $675 price target. Bracelin has long noted that IaaS could be natural consolidators of a highly fragmented SaaS landscape. The transition from traditional client-server applications to cloud computing models over the past 20+ years has created a proliferation of SaaS applications that today include 100+ publics and 1,000+ privates, Bracelin said. Private equity firms such as Thoma Bravo and Vista Equity Partners have been the most prolific consolidators of the SaaS ecosystem over the past three to five years. The analyst flagged Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Oracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL) as the only two cloud platforms operating over $10 billion IaaS platforms alongside over $10 billion SaaS application suites.  Bracelin argued that Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet could move higher up the stack into SaaS applications. HubSpot was a SaaS pioneer that has expanded revenue to plus $2 billion since it was founded in 2006, he said. The analyst believed the combination of Google Workspace and the HubSpot Customer Platform makes strategic sense. HubSpot has 205K paid customers, with an average size of 25 employees per customer, while Google Workspace has 9 million paid customers. Bracelin said the potential cross-sell of HubSpot SaaS applications into a large Google Workspace installed base could be compelling. According to Gartner, HubSpot has captured a small slice of the $22 billion CRM marketing software industry with just a 4.9% market share in 2022. The two most prominent platforms in CRM marketing include Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) (15% share) and Adobe Inc (NASDAQ:ADBE) (15% share). Canaccord Genuity analyst Richard Davis maintained HubSpot with a Buy and raised the price target from $700 to $750.  HubSpot stock gained 67% in the past 12 months. Investors can gain exposure to the stock via Sterling Capital Focus Equity ETF (NYSE:LCG) and Spear Alpha ETF (NASDAQ:SPRX).

      "Wedbush's Dan Ives thinks that a culmination of the AI revolution and improving ad spending will make the March quarter \"one to watch\" for companies in the technology sector. What Happened: Ives expressed optimism about the prospects of big technology companies in the March 2024 quarter. \"I think it's going to be one for the ages in terms of digital advertising,\" Ives explained, underscoring that Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google is his top pick for this reason. Ives thinks that the spending environment in the tech industry is improving. This will help us see the next part of the \"AI revolution,\" according to Ives. \"Big Tech earnings should be robust for 1Q and an important moment to put fuel into this tech rally with earnings/growth moving higher,\" Ives said in an interview with CNBC.  Subscribe to the Benzinga Tech Trends newsletter to get all the latest tech developments delivered to your inbox. Ives has been consistent in his belief that the next phase of the AI revolution is the demand of AI and cloud computing. After Oracle Corp.'s (NYSE:ORCL) fiscal third-quarter earnings, Ives underscored that its \"hypergrowth\" in AI is the \"big clue\" of the AI revolution puzzle. Now, based on Wedbush's surveys, Ives thinks that the growth here is \"much stronger than expected\" when it comes to advertising, which will help boost Google's revenues. See Also: Mark Cuban Dispels Rumors About AI Bubble, Comparing It To Dot-Com Era ‘Frothiness’: ‘There Were…Companies With Just A Website And Going Public’  \"We think Google here could ultimately have a $30-$40 upside on digital advertising as well as what we’re seeing on the cloud side.\" Ives is also optimistic about Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) on the AI and cloud fronts, and Mark Zuckerberg-led Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is also on his radar. Big Tech earnings should be robust for 1Q and an important moment to put fuel into this tech rally with earnings/growth moving higher @LastCallCNBC https://t.co/m941Mlpuhy Why It Matters: Ives' bullish outlook concerning Google is noteworthy after it struggled with its AI chatbot, Gemini. In March, Wedbush said in a note seen by Benzinga that the risks to Google Search from AI are \"overstated\" and it was added to the brokerage firm's \"Best Ideas List\" (BIL) as well.  At the time, Wedbush raised its target price for Google from $160 to $175, with an \"outperform\" rating. However, Ives now thinks that there is a potential upside of $30 to $40 for the search giant. Overall, Ives has a positive outlook for the tech sector. He thinks that tech stocks have an upside of up to 15% for the rest of the year, on the back of an improved spending environment.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Despite being a leader in the rollout of artificial intelligence products, Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock hasn’t set the world on fire lately. That might be about to change. Year to date, Microsoft stock is up 13%, which is a little better than the 11% gain achieved by the benchmark S&P 500 index. In the last 12 months, the technology giant’s stock has risen 46%. While decent, the gains pale in comparison to those achieved by other companies that are closely associated with AI. Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock is up 225% over the last year while Meta Platforms’ (NASDAQ:META) share price has increased 136%. Of course, Microsoft is more than an AI company. But it is AI that is likely to drive the company’s sales and profits, and share price, moving forward. Microsoft has been making big bets on AI ever since it invested $10 billion into privately held OpenAI, the company whose AI chatbots took the world by storm last year. More recently, Microsoft has announced plans to build a massive data center to run AI software that could require an investment of $100 billion. That would be an incredible investment considering that Microsoft’s total capital spending over the last four years combined was $104 billion.  The data center investment, which also involves plans to develop an AI supercomputer called “Stargate” for launch in 2028, is the latest example of Microsoft going all-in on AI.  In February of this year, Microsoft announced that it is ramping up its investments in AI around the world, pledging to spend $5.60 billion in Europe alone. At the same time that it is increasing its spending, Microsoft is also pushing to monetize the technology and boost its sales and profits. The best example of the monetization efforts can be found with Microsoft Copilot, the company’s AI chatbot or assistant. Microsoft is now charging subscriptions of $30 a month for access to Copilot, and Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives forecasts that it could add $25 billion to $30 billion to Microsoft’s revenues by 2025. Ives recently boosted his price target on MSFT stock to $500 from $475 and stated that the “AI revolution is here.” Also citing the monetization of Copilot, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) maintained a “buy” rating on Microsoft’s stock and a $480 price target, calling the company a “top pick.” Beyond AI, there are many other business units that are accelerating and benefitting Microsoft. These include the Xbox unit following the successful $69 billion acquisition of video game maker Activision Blizzard, and the Azure cloud-computing segment. Cloud was a particular bright spot in Microsoft’s fourth quarter 2023 earnings report. The company reported that revenue from Azure and other cloud services grew 30% year over year in Q4. Analysts had forecast growth of 27.7%. Microsoft stock now has 53,000 Azure AI customers, and one-third of them are new to Azure in the past year, said the company in its earnings release. Commitments to spend more than $1 billion on Azure cloud services in the year ahead increased during  Q4 2023. Today, Microsoft is the second largest cloud-computing company in the world after Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Data from the Synergy Research Group shows that Microsoft’s Azure infrastructure controls 20% of the world’s $130 billion cloud market. Together, Amazon and Microsoft control 52% of the global cloud market, and cloud-computing remains a huge growth driver at Microsoft.  Microsoft stock achieved a milestone earlier this year when its market capitalization surpassed $3 trillion and it became the biggest publicly traded company in the world. Going forward, more growth and gains can be expected, especially as the company monetizes its AI offerings. With leading role in areas ranging from not only AI but also video games, cloud-computing, and software, Microsoft remains a best-in-class technology concern that should be part of every investors’ portfolio. MSFT stock is a buy. On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in NVDA and MSFT.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips China is a conundrum. With 900 million people, the country is the world’s biggest consumer market and United States companies love tapping into it. Whether it’s a new expansion opportunity or just a way to stave off slowing growth in more mature and saturated markets, companies eagerly do business there. Yet it’s problematic, too. Just ask these tech stock titans. Foremost is China’s use of slave labor. Human Rights Watch says the government uses Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslim communities in forced labor camps. Products including car parts, solar panels and apparel from businesses such as PDD Holdings‘ (NASDAQ:PDD) Temu and Schein are regularly sold in the U.S. And American companies as wide-ranging as Nike (NYSE:NKE) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) have endured scrutiny for tainting their supply chains by using forced labor products. The ongoing war in Ukraine also helped raise tensions between Washington and Beijing that spilled over into trade issues. President Biden imposed restrictions on the sale of semiconductors and advanced technology to China which retaliated with restrictions of its own. Not just in computer chips but by subsidizing local companies to challenge sales by U.S. corporations. Other businesses are simply prohibited from operating there. Twitter and Facebook are two companies banned over free speech fears. These three tech stocks facing China challenges face very high hurdles to spur sales growth.  One of the most high-profile fallouts from heightened trade tensions is China blocking Intel‘s (NASDAQ:INTC) chips from beiung used in government computers and servers. Reminiscent of the arguments U.S. politicians are using to ban TikTok or force its sale, China issued a list of “safe and reliable” CPUs, databases and operating systems companies could use. The products were all from Chinese companies. Also caught up in the ban are chips from Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Microsoft‘s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Windows operating system. But it’s a heavy blow to Intel, which was looking to China expansion to revitalize its growth efforts. Nearly 75% of Intel’s revenue comes from outside the U.S. China represents 27% of the chipmaker’s $54.2 billion total revenue, or almost $15 billion. The country also represents 15% of Advanced Micro’s $23 billion revenues. Intel’s stock is down 23% year to date as a result of disappointing guidance issued earlier this year. As trade war hawks in both political parties rail against China in an election year, don’t expect INTC stock to run much higher. It’s not just in the U.S. where the fervor for electric vehicles (EV) is subsiding. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) saw its market share in China slip to 6.6% in the first two months of 2024 from 7.6% last year as overall EV sales slowed. Coupled with increased competition from Chinese manufacturers like BYD (OTCMKTS:BDDYF), Nio (NYSE:NIO) and Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI), the going is getting tough for Tesla.  The EV maker reported first-quarter deliveries tumbled 8.5% to 386,810 vehicles where analysts had expected 457,000 deliveries. It also marked a 20% slide in sales sequentially. However, Tesla’s consolation prize was regaining the title of world’s largest EV maker after BYD reported deliveries plummeted 43% to 300,411 vehicles. All EV manufacturers are now locked in a price-cutting war that will likely decimate profits for the companies. Tesla slashed prices on its Model 3 and Model Y cars in China earlier this year. It also began offering cash discounts on Model Ys beginning Feb. 1. Now the EV maker is offering additional incentives on cars in China, including insurance, paint colors and financing options. It’s likely its rivals will respond as they did to Tesla’s earlier buyer enticements. Tesla stock is down 34% year-to-date and could go lower as sales slow and discounting heats up. Drop this and the other tech stock titans we mentioned. The third tech stock facing China challenges is Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). It saw iPhone shipments tumble 33% in February, according to Bloomberg News. There were only 2.4 million devices shipped that month but the number was affected by China’s Lunar New Year holiday. As Apple is the only cross-border company with a sizable market share in China, it bore the brunt of the decline. The tech giant has been working overtime to smooth relations in the country. CEO Tim Cook recently traveled to China to meet with government officials and open a new flagship store in Shanghai. He promised to increase Apple’s investment in China in the long run. With the new iPhone 16 due out later this year, Cook wants to ensure the road to sales is paved before its debut.  Apple also recently reached a $490 million settlement with plaintiffs in a class-action lawsuit. They alleged Cook lied to shareholders in 2019 by concealing just how bad the iPhone was selling in China. Apple surprised the market by slashing quarterly revenue forecasts by $9 billion on declining demand in China. The situation is emblematic of the ongoing difficulty U.S. companies face when doing business there. Apple stock is down 12% so far this year. This and the other tech stock titans we have mentioned need to be dropped soon.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Investment managers tend to flock to a select group of outperforming stocks that drive consistent returns. The stocks top money managers can’t live without generally hail from sectors like technology, healthcare and consumer staples. However, tech reigns supreme, hosting stocks that permeate most portfolios. In particular, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) represent core technology holdings found among an overwhelming majority of money managers. For instance, Apple constitutes Warren Buffett’s top position at Berkshire Hathaway, making up over 40% of its holdings. Meanwhile, Ken Fisher, Mairs and Power, Philippe Laffont’s Coatue Management and Fidelity’s Contrafund all share top stakes in Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon as well. Exciting AI and metaverse plays like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) entice more risk-tolerant managers. However, Microsoft, Appl and Amazon remain the cherished stocks top money managers can’t live without thanks to their dominant positions and immense growth runways in cloud computing, e-commerce and beyond. This article explores why these big tech companies represent such a significant allocation across top investment managers’ portfolios. With its strong fundamentals and competitive edge, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is undoubtedly one of the stocks top money managers can’t live without. As many portfolio managers have wisely realized, Microsoft is exceptionally positioned for long-term outperformance. This is especially obvious when taking into account the near monopoly the company holds across some of the company’s key business segments.  Powering Microsoft’s success is its cloud dominance. The tech titan’s robust cloud platform remains unrivaled, fueling its Q2 2024 revenue growth to $62 billion, up 18% year-over-year. Such financial strength confirms Microsoft’s near monopoly status in major tech sectors. Plus, with sturdy operating income up 33% to $27 billion for the quarter, Microsoft has the backing to continue expanding its cloud, AI and metaverse lead. Adding to its upside potential, Microsoft is making big metaverse moves — evidenced by its monumental $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard last October. This deal fortifies Microsoft’s supremacy in gaming while allowing for tremendous metaverse monetization ahead. With gaming revenue already up 61% in Q2 2024, Microsoft is clearly on track to deliver metaverse profits down the road. Given its cloud dominance, metaverse momentum and exceptional growth metrics this quarter, Microsoft epitomizes one of the key stocks top money managers can’t live without for both present returns and future-forward gains. Its coveted brand and dominant position in consumer technology make Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) one of the favored stocks top money managers can’t live without. The iPhone maker continues to ride on hardware sales and services revenue, surpassing Wall Street estimates. In its latest earnings report for the first quarter of fiscal 2024, ending Dec. 31, 2023, Apple posted over $119 billion in quarterly revenue, an increase of 2% YoY. Fueled by robust iPhone demand during the holiday season, Apple even faced supply chain constraints that limited sales growth. Still, the results beat expectations. This resilience confirms why Apple remains a favorite among institutional investors and top money managers.  Bolstering its hardware ecosystem further, Apple recently unveiled a mixed-reality headset called Vision Pro in January 2024. The $3,499 premium device with both AR and VR capabilities targets creative professionals and showcases Apple’s ambitions in futuristic technologies. Although niche for now, it expands Apple’s total addressable market. With immense brand loyalty and an installed base exceeding 1.8 billion active devices globally, Apple retains pricing power and stable revenues. Top money managers see these qualities as enduring competitive strengths no matter the economic climate. Additionally, Apple’s services segment hit an all-time revenue record of $23.1 billion last quarter, up 11%. Offerings like Apple Music, iCloud, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade and more drive this high-margin recurring revenue stream. Such resilience makes Apple one of the stocks top money managers can’t live without, even amidst market uncertainty. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has firmly established itself as one of the stocks top money managers can’t live without thanks to its dominant position in global e-commerce and cloud computing. The company reported staggering net sales of $574.8 billion in 2023, up 12% year-over-year. Operating income also soared to $36.9 billion, triple that of the previous year. Driving this growth is Amazon’s core online retail segment, which continues to make up a significant portion of total sales. However, its true crown jewel is Amazon Web Services (AWS) — the company’s cloud computing arm. AWS raked in revenue of $91 billion in 2023, with operating margins hitting a superb 30%. With the global cloud market expected to hit $1.6 trillion by 2030, AWS provides an immense growth runway. Geographically, too, Amazon still has plenty of room to expand. Online shopping only accounts for 16% of total U.S. retail sales, a number that Amazon has greatly influenced. By securing nearly 40% of all U.S. e-commerce spending, Amazon is poised to benefit tremendously as more shopping moves online. Given these outstanding fundamentals and growth prospects, it is no wonder that money managers view Amazon as a core long-term holding. Nearly every major mutual fund has a sizable stake in Amazon stock. With dominant positions in two high-growth markets, Amazon remains undoubtedly one of the stocks top money managers can’t live without.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips The technology sector is more dynamic than ever. Companies not investing enough in research and development will likely go into oblivion. I am not only talking about technology companies but entities across sectors that fail to adopt new innovations. In the recent past, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has grabbed headlines. As the market for AI swells, its stock remains a hot commodity. However, the focus of this column is on the lesser-known or under-the-radar technology stocks for multibagger returns. Talking about the scale of growth, AI is expected to contribute up to $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. Of that, “$6.6 trillion is likely to come from increased productivity, and $9.1 trillion is likely to come from consumption-side effects.” There will be multiple participants from the technology sector towards this growth contribution. The addressable market is, therefore, significant, and I am just talking about AI. Let’s discuss three under-the-radar technology stocks that can be massive value creators.  Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) was listed in September 2023 and has trended higher by 123% in 6 months. However, being a relatively new listing, ARM stock is still under the radar. Further, I believe the company will likely create immense value in the next five years. As an overview, Arm Holdings develops and licenses central processing unit products and related technologies. Semiconductor companies and original equipment manufacturers are the end users of the company’s products. For Q3 2023, Arm reported revenue of $824 million, up 14% year-on-year (YoY). For the same period, the company shipped 7.7 billion chips. It’s worth noting that the company’s trailing 12-month free cash flow was $724 million. Considering steady growth in license and royalty revenue, I expect annual FCF to be more than $1 billion in the next 24 months. An important point to note is that until 2016, Arm was focused on general-purpose CPUs. Currently, the company has AI-enabled CPUs tailor-made for specific industries. These industries include IoT, consumer electronics, cloud networking, automobile and mobile. The addressable market is, therefore, significant for the coming years. Amdocs (NASDAQ:DOX) provides software and services to the telecommunication and media industry globally. In the last 12 months, DOX stock has remained sideways and trades at an attractive forward price-earnings ratio of 13.7. Further, the stock offers a dividend yield of 2.14%. Given the fundamentals and industry growth potential, DOX stock is worth holding for the next five years.  For Q1 2024, Amdocs reported revenue of $1.25 billion and a record 12-month backlog of $4.21 billion. Further, the company reiterated its free cash flow outlook of $750 million for the year. It’s also worth noting that Amdocs has a liquidity buffer of $1.1 billion. That is important to mention as Amdocs has been investing to stay ahead of the curve. The company has also pursued opportunistic acquisitions. As an example, Amdocs is working on Generative AI strategy acceleration. In February, the company expanded its partnership with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to drive Generative AI innovation for the telecommunication industry. Photronics (NASDAQ:PLAB) is another undervalued technology stock to buy. Even after a rally of almost 75% in the last 12 months, PLAB stock trades at a forward price-earnings ratio of 13. I would bet on multibagger returns from the stock over an investment horizon of five years. As an overview, Photronics is a global provider of photomask products and services. These photomasks are used in manufacturing integrated circuits and flat panel displays. The company also provides electrical and optical components. For Q1 2024, the company reported muted revenue growth of 2% YoY to $216.3 million. However, the order rates have improved, which could translate into growth acceleration. For Q2, the company has guided for revenue of $231 million with an operating margin of around 28%.  Besides the numbers, I am bullish on the long-term growth outlook. With the incorporation of chips in IoT, 5G, crypto and consumer products, the demand for photomasks will remain in an uptrend. Further, Photronics is focusing on margin expansion, and as cash flows swell, PLAB stock is likely to trend higher.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Ken Fisher of Fisher Asset Management comes from investing royalty. His father, Philip Fisher, wrote the investment classic “Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits” and whom Morningstar called “one of the great investors of all time.” He was a long-term, buy-and-hold investor who, like Warren Buffett, believed the best time to sell a stock was “almost never.” Many of those attributes were passed down to his son, who manages $265 billion in assets under management (AUM). Despite its size, Fisher Asset Management has notched some impressive gains over the past decade. The firm’s 10-year annual returns are north of 58%, while over the last five years, Fisher returned 63%. In just the last 12 months he is up to 24%. Although he has a large portfolio containing well over 900 companies, these are the three stocks dominating this investing icon’s portfolio today. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) recently slipped to fifth place as the most valuable company in Fisher’s portfolio, but its performance so far this year has been stellar. AMZN stock is up 20% year to date and more than 76% higher over the past year.  Because the online retailer is so integral to the economy, it was added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average. It’s not just because of its e-commerce platform but also its cloud services business, which provides the backbone for the internet presence of numerous companies. And it continues to improve itself. Cost-cutting measures and integration of artificial intelligence (AI) are paying benefits to Amazon. Strong revenue and better profit margins over the past few quarters are just some of the tangible results of its efforts. Perhaps most notable is the surge in advertising revenue, up 27% last quarter to $14.7 billion. It is already the third-largest ad platform behind Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). Fisher owns 41.8 million shares of Amazon stock worth $7.6 billion, making it the fourth-largest position in his portfolio at 3.7% of the total. With an average purchase price of around $54 per share, Fisher has seen his investment more than triple in value. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the biggest position Fisher owns. It represents 5% of his portfolio. Few stocks are as closely associated with AI as Microsoft. Having integrated OpenAI’s ChatGPT generative AI technology into all aspects of its operations, the tech giant is receiving significant dividends. AI contributed 600 basis points of growth to Microsoft’s Azure cloud services business last quarter, double what it had done just one quarter prior. It is also helping Microsoft land more and bigger deals for longer contractual periods of time.  Clients like Azure. It allows them to grow their transition to the cloud at their own pace. The hybrid environment lets them choose the level of service they want and where they want it. They can choose between on-premises, in the cloud or a combination of both. Expect to see AI’s growth rate and contribution to Microsoft accelerate in the coming quarters. Fisher owns 25.4 million shares of MSFT stock worth $10.7 billion. He’s generated gains of 291% so far with his average purchase price of $107 per share. The No. two holding in Fisher Asset Management is Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Despite all the headwinds the consumer electronics stock faces, Apple has tripled Fisher’s investment from the average buy-in price of $51 per share. Yet the headwinds are legion. Most notable is the Justice Dept. suing Apple for antitrust violations. Although some of the allegations seem ludicrous, such as operating a monopoly when it has but a 57% share of the domestic smartphone market, it will be a distraction for management as it fights back against the charges. Apple also has its work cut out for it in China, one of its biggest markets but also one that has seen sales slow dramatically. Its iPhone sales reportedly plummeted 33% in China in January and February, according to Bloomberg News. Of course, March tends to be the strongest month of the three in the quarter, so we will need to see how the iPhone fared then.  The consumer tech leader has its next iteration of the smartphone coming out later this year. The iPhone 16 should also have some form of Google’s own AI technology accessible so it could be a big seller. Apple stock is down 9% year-to-date, but no one suggests the party is over by a long shot.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips While the innovation space seemingly lacks no shortage of interest, not every enterprise benefits from the spotlight, which brings us to tech stocks ready to rebound. Yes, there are indeed certain compelling tech plays that aren’t getting the attention they deserve. To be sure, the space is speculative. Let’s be real. The usual suspects – your Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) or Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), to name but a few examples – enjoy significant upside momentum in part because everybody else believes in their potential. When you step away from the spotlight, the environment becomes much more adventurous, to put it diplomatically. Nevertheless, if you’re looking to be a fourth-quarter hero (as in football, not fiscally), then these tech stocks ready to rebound could be right up your alley. Falling under the infrastructure software category of tech stocks ready to rebound, Shift4 Payments (NYSE:FOUR) provides software and payment processing solutions in the U.S. and internationally. Per its public profile, Shift4 offers multiple products and services, including an omni-channel card acceptance and processing solution platform.  One of the key reasons why FOUR stock should be on your radar is Wall Street’s assessment of the business. Currently, experts rate shares a consensus strong buy with a $93.18 average price target. Further, the high-side estimate calls for a price tag of $105 per share. Aside from a bum note in the fourth quarter – when Shift4 posted earnings per share of 76 cents against a target of 82 cents – the company was a top performer. In fiscal 2023, the average earnings beat (including the Q4 miss) came out to 25.95%. For fiscal 2024, experts are looking at EPS of $3.68, well above last year’s print of $2.83. Also, revenue should land at $3.75 billion, up a massive 46% from 2023’s result of $2.56 billion. Another entity within the software infrastructure arena, LiveRamp (NYSE:RAMP) operates a data collaboration platform. Per its corporate profile, the company provides a mechanism to unify customer and prospect data to build a single view of the customer in a way that protects consumer privacy. LiveRamp sells its services to many industries, including insurance, retail and automotive, among many others. As with Shift4 Payments, one of the reasons to consider RAMP is Wall Street’s support. Right now, RAMP enjoys a unanimous strong buy rating. Further, the average price target lands at $48.75, with the most optimistic target reaching $51.  Notably, LiveRamp beat all its quarterly bottom-line targets for fiscal 2023 and by a wide margin. The average positive earnings surprise came out to an impressive 56.78%. For fiscal 2024, experts see EPS hitting $1.47, above last year’s print of 86 cents. Also, the company could ring up sales of $648.28 million, implying almost 9% year-over-year growth. It’s one of the tech stocks ready to rebound. Listed under the semiconductor segment, Allegro MicroSystems (NASDAQ:ALGM) designs, develops, manufactures and markets sensor integrated circuits (ICs) and application-specific analog power ICs for motion control and energy-efficient systems. Primarily, it provides original equipment manufacturer (OEM) components for the automotive and industrial markets. A middle-capitalization, Allegro doesn’t receive the attention of some of the heavyweights. Still, ALGM makes a strong case for tech stocks ready to rebound. For one thing, analysts rate shares a consensus strong buy. Further, the average price target comes in at $38.13, with the high-side estimate landing at $45. While its fiscal performance hasn’t exactly lit up the board, it’s consistently profitable. In 2023, Allegro beat all its quarterly bottom-line targets. Its average positive earnings surprise reached 6.65%. The best performance came in Q4, when it posted EPS of 32 cents against a 29-cent target.  For fiscal 2024, experts believe EPS will hit $1.32, up from last year’s $1.28. Also, they’re looking for sales growth of 7.2% YOY to $1.04 billion. Operating under the application software segment, Intapp (NASDAQ:INTA) provides industry-specific cloud-based software solutions for the professional and financial services industry in the U.S., U.K. and internationally. Some of its solutions include a platform that helps manages financial services firms’ market relationships, along with those of prospective clients. Intapp also provides offerings that help its enterprise clients maximize the benefits of artificial intelligence. As with the other ideas for tech stocks ready to rebound, INTA enjoys strong support from Wall Street. Indeed, the security lands a unanimous strong buy rating. Notably, the average price target stands at $50.44, while the high-side estimate calls for $57. Fiscally, one of Intapp’s strengths is consistent profitability. Interestingly, experts keep doubting it. For example, in Q1, the company posted earnings of three cents per share against a breakeven target. In Q4, it posted EPS of 11 cents against a target of five cents. For fiscal 2024, analysts see EPS of 34 cents, well above last year’s print of 11 cents. And revenue could reach $425.04 million, up 21.1% YOY.  Falling under the consumer electronics category, Sonos (NASDAQ:SONO) designs, develops, manufactures and sells audio products and services in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia-Pacific. Per its corporate profile, Sonos offers wireless, portable and home-theater speakers, along with components and accessories. It’s a risky play but a possible improvement in consumer discretionary sentiment could help SONO stock. Despite the current headwinds, analysts appreciate the enterprise, rating it a consensus strong buy. Enticingly, the average price target reaches $29.52 while the high-side estimate calls for $55. Of course, a main concern is that in the past 52 weeks, SONO has been all over the map. Fiscally, the problem manifests in the bottom line. Overall, the average surprise in 2023 came in at 0.48%. That’s not exactly encouraging. However, in Q4, the company delivered EPS of 64 cents against a target of 39 cents. For fiscal 2024, analysts believe EPS will reach 25 cents. If so, that would be a dramatic shift from last year’s print of a loss of eight cents per share. However, investors may need to wait till fiscal 2025 for revenue growth to materialize. Falling under the application software segment, Braze (NASDAQ:BRZE) operates a customer engagement platform that provides interactions between consumers and brands worldwide. According to its public profile, the company offers data ingestion products, such as Braze software development kits that automatically manage data ingestion and deliver mobile and web notifications, in-application/in-browser interstitial messages and content cards.  While Braze might not get everyone’s attention, those in the know believe it’s one of the tech stocks ready to rebound. Analysts rate shares a consensus strong buy. It’s only one hold rating shy of a unanimous buy rating. Overall, the average price target reaches $68.86, with the high-side estimate coming in at $80. While the company isn’t profitable, it is beating its bottom-line target. For fiscal 2023, the average surprise jumped to 45.18%. Its best performance was Q2, when Braze delivered a loss of 4 cents against expected red ink of 14 cents. For the current fiscal year (2025), analysts are looking for significant growth: $574.15 million on the top line, beating out last year’s print of $471.8 million by 21.7%. Listed under the consumer defensive space, Coursera (NYSE:COUR) operates within the education and training services subcategory. That about explains it all. According to its corporate profile, Coursera operates an online educational content platform in the United States, Europe, Africa, Asia-Pacific, the Middle East and internationally. Given the changes in the workforce post-pandemic, COUR could be an intriguing idea for tech stocks ready to rebound. Now, don’t get me wrong – COIUR is extremely volatile. With that, the analysts’ consensus view comes in at a moderate buy. Still, I suppose the optimist might say that a buy is a buy. Not only that, the average price target of $23.20 will likely pique curiosity among bullish speculators. Also, the low-side target of $15 still implies growth.  Despite the heightened risk profile, Coursera gets the business done. For example, the company posted EPS of 6 cents in Q4, above analysts estimation of a breakeven quarter. It also beat out quarterly projections earlier in the year by a wide margin. For fiscal 2024, experts see significant growth: a revenue target of $736.45 million or 15.8% up from last year’s print of $635.76 million. Thus, it could be one of the tech stocks ready to rebound.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Microchip and semiconductor concern Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has led the market ever since the current rally began in autumn 2022. Its run has been incredible. Since October 2022, NVDA stock has increased 695%. The company’s share price has risen an astounding 1,765% over the last five years. The growth has pushed Nvidia’s market capitalization to above $2 trillion and made it the third largest publicly traded company in the world after Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). The key to the success of NVDA stock has been the rising demand for the company’s chips and semiconductors, which are used to power artificial intelligence models and applications. The massive worldwide demand has led to a surge in Nvidia’s sales and profits. For the final quarter of 2023, Nvidia reported that its sales increased 265% from a year earlier and its profits grew 769% year over year. The company’s earnings reports have become a highly anticipated and closely watched event across the entire stock market. So who will be the next Nvidia? Which companies are positioned to steal its crown? Here are three AI stocks that will leave Nvidia in the dust. Shares of Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) are running circles around Nvidia right now. MU stock has risen by 34% in the past month after the company announced financial results that beat Wall Street forecasts and provided upbeat forward guidance driven by AI demand. Micron, which makes memory and storage for computers and specializes in USB flash drives, announced in March earnings per share of 42 cents compared to a loss of 25 cents that was expected among analysts who cover the company.  Revenue amounted to $5.82 billion versus $5.35 billion, which was expected on Wall Street. Management said the company is benefitting from the current AI boom, with demand for its memory and computer data storage products rising. Micron provides memory and storage for new AI systems around the world. Looking ahead, executives said they expect to report revenue of $6.60 billion for the just-completed first quarter, which is above the $6.02 billion that was expected by analysts. Thanks to its post-earnings bounce, MU stock has now been up 55% since the start of this year and has more than doubled over the last 12 months. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is nipping at Nvidia’s heels. One of its most direct competitors, AMD, as the company is known, has developed a series of microchips specifically for AI models and applications that it hopes will rival Nvidia’s chips and semiconductors. Last December, AMD unveiled a new series of microchips called the “Ryzen 8040” that are aimed at boosting AI applications by up to 60%. Those new chips will be incorporated into laptops and personal computers (PCs). AMD has also launched the new MI300X accelerator microchip that’s used in data centers and servers and competes against Nvidia’s AI data center chips. Companies ranging from Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) to Microsoft have been buying up the MI300X chips, and AMD executives have said that they expect the data center microchips to generate $2 billion in sales for all of this year. The new AI microchips and decent earnings have AMD stock up 87% over the last 12 months, including a 30% gain so far in 2024. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (NYSE:TSM) is arguably the most important company to Nvidia and the entire AI industry. This is because TSMC, as the company is popularly known, makes three-quarters (75%) of the microchips in the world, including those designed by Nvidia, as well as nearly all the chips and semiconductors that power AI technologies. The growing importance of TSMC to the AI and chip industries has its stock up by 52% in the last year, including a 39% year-to-date gain.  During their most recent earnings call, TSMC executives said that the company is well-positioned to capture current and future growth opportunities, especially related to AI. Taiwan Semiconductor is increasingly focused on AI chips and semiconductors as it executes a global expansion plan. The company recently opened its first microchip plant in Japan, moving beyond its home market in Taiwan. It is also developing two new microchip plants in Arizona at a cost of $40 billion.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips When determining which stocks to invest in, it’s important to decide whether their operating sectors are prosperous and performing well. If very few consumers are eating out, buying shares of a restaurant probably would not be a good idea. I’d recommend doing research on the industries set to dominate the second half of 2024 prior to making your stock picks for the year. In order to ascertain which sectors will outperform in the near-to-medium term, it’s important to consider the impact of strong macro trends. Artificial intelligence and the rapidly growing consumer spending in the U.S. are two of the most dominant macro trends. Despite the recent rise, I believe that we can expect interest rates to come down at least 0.75 percentage points this year. I kept those macro trends in mind when choosing these industries set to dominate the second half of 2024. The use of AI is spreading quite rapidly and widely. Indeed, according to an estimate cited by Forbes, “The global artificial intelligence market…. (will) expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 37.3% from 2023 to 2030.” The sector’s revenues are expected to reach $1.8 trillion by 2030. This will greatly benefit the data center industry. Large amounts of data storage and computing power are required for training and delivering AI. Data centers provide both services.  Unsurprisingly given the rapid growth of AI and data centers’ centrality in enabling AI, data center rental costs have increased rapidly. Last year, the average rental rate jumped 18.6% after the metric rose 14.5% in 2022. With the use of AI still rising by large amounts, the demand for data centers is likely to surge in 2024, causing rent to climb again. Among the data center operators that are likely to benefit tremendously are Digital Realty (NYSE:DLR) and Equinix (NASDAQ:EQIX). The amount spent on computer and storage infrastructure for cloud deployment climbed a robust 18.5% in the fourth quarter of last year. Of course, AI is the major catalyst behind the increase. Higher spending on cloud computing and storage tools is positive for cloud infrastructure providers. This includes Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Salesforce (NYSE:CRM). Of course, the trend of higher spending on cloud services is expected to surge this year as AI proliferates. According to Statista, the global outlays by end users on public cloud services is expected to jump to $678.79 billion this year from $563.59 billion in 2023.  On March 13, Morgan Stanley upgraded its rating on the automotive sector to “attractive” from “in-line.” The bank expects many automakers to benefit from stronger-than-expected demand for gasoline-powered vehicles and reduced capital spending. General Motors’ (NYSE:GM) decision to increase its quarterly dividend to 12 cents from 9 cents is making me more upbeat on the sector is. My optimism is also bolstered by renowned investor David Tepper’s purchase of 265,000 shares of GM stock in Q4 2023. Also noteworthy is that the shares of GM and Toyota (NYSE:TM), the two top-selling automakers in the U.S., have a great deal of momentum already. Specifically, GM stock has risen 25% so far in 2024, while Toyota has lodged a 33% gain so far this year. Automakers should also benefit from lower interest rates in the second half of 2024.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has been range bound for several months. This could remain the case in the immediate-term for Microsoft stock. Rate cut uncertainty has crept up again. Perhaps, after over a year of “AI mania,” a bit of “AI fatigue” has taken shape. Investors worry AI growth is overvalued in tech stocks, including Microsoft. MSFT may struggle to rally soon, but the story isn’t finished. We don’t expect another long-term slump in shares like after the Dotcom crash. Instead, far sooner than you think, the positive impact of Microsoft’s AI monetization on overall results could drive the next big surge for shares. Microsoft has been swift to integrate generative AI into its existing products. It has also been creating new subscription-based applications built with this groundbreaking technology. For instance, products like CoPilot for Microsoft 365, as well as Security for CoPilot. Like we’ve pointed out before, both these platforms have the potential to eventually generate tens of billions in additional annual revenue for the company.  While uncertain, the AI software early-mover may have yet another monetization opportunity emerging. This opportunity may mark the start of another potential needle-mover in the making for Microsoft stock. As seen in recent headlines, Microsoft is reportedly working on an Xbox AI support chatbot. While this chatbot itself may not be a needle-mover for MSFT, this could be the first sign that the company has big plans to integrate generative AI technology into its video game business. Despite becoming a much larger part of the overall company, following last year’s acquisition of Activision, Microsoft’s Xbox video game unit has arguably fallen onto the back burner in the minds of investors. However, the potential to commercialize its AI technology through this segment provides yet another avenue for elevated levels of growth.  The future performance of Microsoft stock hinges heavily on the development of AI-related growth streams. Fortunately, as we can clearly see, the company is in the midst of developing many such streams. Per Microsoft’s fiscal results for the quarter ending Dec. 31, 2023, the company has only so far scratched the service in terms of turning this technology into increased revenue and earnings. Yet over the next few quarters, AI is poised to make a more significant impact on both the top and bottom lines. Yes, sell-side consensus calls for growth to come in at around 14% for both revenue and earnings during the upcoming fiscal year ending June 2025. To some, this may seem too low. After all, MSFT, trading for 36 times forward earnings, is priced for higher levels of growth. However, given the size and scope of the company’s AI integration, results in the coming fiscal year may have a strong chance of coming in line with the top end of forecasts.  These call for revenue of nearly $300 billion, and earnings of $14.34 per share, representing growth in excess of 20%. If that doesn’t sound promising enough, FY 2026 could bring similar growth levels. Microsoft is fully committed to maximizing AI growth. This leaves the company well-positioned to grow at a relatively high pace compared to its mammoth size. If growth comes in at around the 20% range, shares could easily maintain their current rich forward valuation. Yes, an additional expansion of this multiple may be a stretch goal at best. There’s potential for shares to align with higher earnings. This prospect alone is promising enough to keep the stock in buy territory. While being mindful of potential volatility in the short-term, feel free to still make Microsoft stock a long-term buy for your portfolio. In fact, near-term turbulence could work in your favor, as it may enable you to enter/add to a position on major weakness.  Microsoft stock earns a B rating in Portfolio Grader.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock has emerged as Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) main AI market. The focus shifts to how this will affect Nvidia’s market share. Meta (NASDAQ:META) and Microsoft’s (NASDQ:MSFT) planned switch to AMD chips, representing 60% of Nvidia’s sales, indicates significant potential shifts. In the AI surge, AMD trails only Nvidia, which is known for its rapid growth. With AI’s rapid growth, AMD holds promise as the second-largest AI chip player. Considering this, let’s dive into why AMD stock remains an excellent option for investors looking for exposure to this space. AMD stock is up meaningfully on the year (roughly 28% higher), but still clearly trails the likes of Nvidia and other AI stocks. This relative valuation gap has been growing, and makes AMD stock an attractive option for growth-at-a-reasonable-price investors, who have clamored to own this stock at lower levels. Concerns around China’s chip replacement strategy briefly impacted prices, and Nvidia’s release of next-generation Blackwell GPUs certainly altered some investors’ view of the competitive landscape of this industry.  That said, it’s a global game, and though China makes up around 15% of AMD’s sales, there’s a lot to like about the company’s relative positioning in the PC market, which appears to be stabilizing. A recent surge in global PC demand bodes well for AMD’s client processor business. Similar growth prospects loom in server CPU and GPU markets. AMD’s server CPU market share rose to 23% in 2023 from 17.6% a year prior, driven by solid demand for EPYC CPUs, noted CEO Lisa Su. The company noted a rising adoption of EPYC CPUs for inferencing tasks. The company’s server CPU growth is sustained, aligning with a projected 26% annual growth in AI server demand until 2029. AMD experienced a robust demand for AI GPUs, raising its data center GPU revenue forecast to $3.5 billion from $2 billion.  Management expects surpassing this figure because of an enhanced supply chain. These factors position AMD favorably to exceed analyst forecasts. In its Q4 2023 report on January 30, 2024, AMD projected Q1 2024 revenue to come in at $5.4 billion, nearly matching the prior year’s $5.35 billion. The semiconductor company sees a 52% non-GAAP gross margin, slightly higher than 2023’s 50%. When talking about revenue, experts expect a much lower number of around $5 billion. With the potential AI-related advantages mentioned, AMD may surpass market expectations significantly. Its recent decline lowered the company’s valuation, with AMD stock now trading at 49-times forward earnings and less than 13-times sales. While expensive, AMD remains the relative value play in the chip space right now, making this an attractive option if the company can blow out earnings expectations in the coming quarters.  AMD trails Nvidia in AI but possesses potent AI accelerator designs and is leveraging third-party manufacturing solutions. If AMD gains AI market share, it may move up in terms of investor discussions alongside Nvidia. Hence, the shift led to reinvestment in undervalued stocks favors AMD, at least right now. Of course, plenty of downside is possible, if the company disappoints in its coming quarterly earnings reports. However, I remain bullish on this stock for now, and believe the AI market is big enough for two players to benefit. Right now, the market disagrees.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang is the business equivalent of Caitlin Clark. By that I mean the performance of Nvidia stock in 2024 has made him a legend. His $79.4 billion fortune makes him the 18th richest person in the world. That wealth is up four-fold in a year. Huang’s every public utterance is picked through for lessons in excellence. “I hope suffering happens to you,” he says, and we nod in agreement. “If I had to do it all over again I wouldn’t.” But what does this mean for a small equity investor? Nothing good. When a rumor spread April 1 that Nvidia had bought the Xbox brand from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), reporters began analyzing it before looking at the calendar. Nvidia’s leadership in AI is now taken for granted. Its Blackwell technology guarantees that artificial general intelligence will be here in a few years.  Huang has made thousands of CEOs into techno-optimists, with tricks like talking robots and brute force computing replacing human intuition. The company’s recent Developer Conference quickly became an “AI Woodstock,” filled with demonstrations and claims that aren’t in the market yet. Nvidia stock has had a rough time getting over $900/share in the last month for a reason. Nvidia’s $2.25 trillion valuation is held up by quarterly revenue that tripled in a single year, and profit margins of 72%. Its operating cash flow in 2024 was three times the previous record, and analysts see it doubling again in 2025. But even given all that, its current valuation is outlandish. It trades at 20 times that expected 2025 revenue, and 16 times the expected fiscal 2026 revenue of $136 billion.  Assume for a moment Nvidia stock can hit the $42/share of earnings estimated by the most optimistic analysts for 2026. You’re paying 21 times those earnings to own the stock right now. Logic says it’s time to take something off the table. There are signs in the AI community that the brute force AI approach made possible by Nvidia may be sub-optimal. There are signs that a model with 1 trillion parameters could be analyzed with much less hardware than we once imagined. It turns out bigger isn’t always better. The signs seen by data scientists aren’t yet being seen by AI analysts. But they are being seen by the Cloud Czars who are Nvidia’s biggest customers. Small models may outperform bigger ones. It’s possible to run an AI model on a phone.  Every emerging technology goes through what Gartner (NYSE:IT) calls a hype cycle. Generative AI is now at the peak of expectations. What analysts should be looking for is an event that starts the “trough of disillusionment.” That’s a necessary sell-off before we figure out the true value of AI and start making money from it. I know where the trough hit the original Internet bubble, because I was there. It came on January 10, 2000, when Time Warner “bought” AOL. AOL was so over-valued it owned 55% of the resulting company. At that point Internet asset valuations reached their peak. They proved out in time. Amazon.Com (NASDAQ:AMZN) hit its 1999 price in 2009 and never looked back. Companies like Alphabet (NASDASQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) that understood what their business was prospered.  Nvidia stock will, too. But there’s a hard rain going to fall before that happens. We saw it in 2000, we saw it in 2008, and we saw it in 2022. You don’t want to be in it when the storm hits. I can’t tell you what event might set it off. Maybe Nvidia really will buy the Xbox. That would do it. As of this writing, Dana Blankenhorn had LONG positions in NVDA, MSFT, AMZN, and GOOGL.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips It’s true that even the most successful large banks and billionaire investors make mistakes. Many of them, for example, have piled large amounts of their money into Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), whose shares dropped 12% so far in 2024. So you might not get rich by copying a few picks made by huge banks and billionaires. But, as I’ve pointed out in the past, these investors do have good track records in general. They have access to top-notch research, and they often receive a great deal of information from company insiders. Therefore, you can certainly do worse than emulating the moves made by these investing gurus. With that said, here are three stocks top investors are buying. In the fourth quarter of last year, Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, Norges Bank, acquired 18.1 million shares of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), while JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) added over 7 million shares. Also importantly, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) bought 3.23 million shares of the firm while Fisher Asset Management, owned by multi-billionaire investor Ken Fisher, acquired over 428,000 shares of the name. So AMZN is certainly one of the stocks top investors are buying. Then, in January Canadian bank RBC Capital identified AMZN as a leading pick in the internet space. The bank cited its belief that the firm’s cloud business’ growth will increase this year. Additionally, RBC expects the growth of AMZN’s e-commerce business to enable its EBIT to beat analysts’ average estimate. Finally, RBC is bullish on the firm’s new ad business and its opportunities in the AI space. JPMorgan bought nearly 7.5 million shares of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock in Q4, while Norges Bank added 9.2 million shares of the name. And, multi-billionaire David Tepper added about 2,720 shares, increasing his total ownership of the firm to 1.7 million shares. Moreover, Goldman Sachs bought nearly 3.26 million shares and RBC Capital acquired almost 1.24 million units.  On March 26, investment bank Wedbush Capital reported that, based on its research, it believed that the growth of MSFT’s revenue from its AI tools was increasing. The bank now expects that 70% of MSFT’s users will eventually utilize its AI tools, up from its previous outlook of 60%. The bank expects the company’s revenue from the technology to reach a positive turning point next year. Multibillionaire hedge fund owner David Tepper bought General Motors (NYSE:GM) stock for the first time in Q4, purchasing 265,000 shares of the American automaker.  Moreover, Norges Bank acquired 2.1 million shares, and Goldman Sachs picked up a huge 5.2 million units. Two Sigma Advisers acquired 1.385 million units of GM in Q4. Finally, Citadel Advisors, owned by multi-billionaire Ken Griffin, bought 2.6 million shares of the name in Q4. In December, Japanese bank Mizuho raised its rating on GM stock to “buy” from “neutral.” As reasons for the change, the bank cited reductions in GM’s fixed costs, changes that will boost the profitability of its EV lineup, and a suspension of its investments in its Cruise autonomous unit. Additionally, Mizuho was pleased with the $10 billion of share buybacks which the firm expects to carry out this year. On the date of publication, Larry Ramer held a long position in AMZN.

      "The “Magnificent Seven” is a term coined to describe big tech giants such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), Meta (NASDAQ:META), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). Each of these stocks gained at least 49% in 2023 and have strong competitive advantages. Here, I have shortlisted one Magnificent Seven stock, Alphabet, to see if it is a good buy right now. Overall, I am bullish on Alphabet due to its attractive valuation, the AI megatrend, and its expanding profit margins. Alphabet is the parent company of Google, the largest search engine platform globally. Valued at $1.93 trillion, Alphabet generates a majority of its sales from online ads on its search engine and YouTube, which Google acquired more than a decade ago. Moreover, Alphabet sells applications, digital content, and in-app purchases via the Google Play store. In recent years, Alphabet has entered high-growth segments such as public cloud and artificial intelligence, diversifying its revenue streams in the process. Shares of Alphabet went public in August 2004 and have since returned a monstrous 5,637%. It means a $1,000 investment in GOOGL stock soon after its IPO would be worth close to $60,000 today. In this period, the S&P 500 Index (SPX) returned “just” 600%.  Despite an uncertain macro environment in 2023, Alphabet increased its sales by 9% year-over-year to $307 billion. Its top-line growth accelerated to 13% in the December quarter, surpassing $86 billion. A focus on cost optimization meant the company’s cost of sales rose by only 5% to $23.6 billion, while operating expenses stood at $25 billion, up 11%, allowing the tech giant to report an operating income of $23.7 billion, up 30% compared to the year-ago period, indicating a healthy margin of 27%. A high operating margin translates into free cash flow, which can be deployed to reinvest in organic growth, enhance shareholder wealth, and target accretive acquisitions. In Q4, Alphabet reported free cash flow of $7.9 billion, while the number was much higher at $69 billion in 2023. Similar to other tech heavyweights, Alphabet allocated $62 billion to share buybacks for its Class A and Class C shares last year and ended 2023 with $111 billion in total cash. Alphabet is among the leading players in the artificial intelligence space. In fact, the company is deploying AI capabilities to improve its portfolio of products from Search to ads. In the last year, Alphabet launched AI-powered products such as Bard and Gemini, which should fuel the next generation of advances.  While Gemini has encountered some issues, the platform is engineered to understand and combine text, images, audio, video, and code while running on devices ranging from smartphones to data centers. Alphabet emphasized that it is experimenting with Gemini in Search, making SGE (Search Generative Experience) faster for users. By integrating AI with Search, Alphabet serves a wide range of information requirements. Bard is Alphabet’s conversational AI tool that is powered by Gemini Pro. Available in 40 languages and 230 countries, Bard will remain a key platform for Alphabet, going forward. Alphabet ended 2023 with more than $15 billion in annual subscription revenue, primarily driven by YouTube. Today, YouTube Music and YouTube Premium are available in more than 100 countries, and these platforms enjoy a highly engaged user base. Generally, recurring sales allow a company to generate steady cash flows across market cycles. Alphabet’s increase in subscription sales over the years showcases its ability to deliver high-value offerings to a wide range of users.  Another subscription service offered by Alphabet is Google One, where you pay to store your photos, videos, files, and other data. Google One is experiencing strong user growth and has attracted almost 100 million subscribers to date. Turning to Google Cloud, the business increased sales by 26% year-over-year in Q4 to $9.2 billion. The segment is now reporting consistent profits, ending Q4 with an operating income of $864 million, indicating a margin of 9%. For FY 2023, Google Cloud sales rose 26% to $33 billion, accounting for more than 10% of total revenue. Google Cloud aims to integrate Gemini to widen its base of enterprise customers which should also drive engagement rates higher. Alphabet claimed strong demand for its vertically integrated AI portfolio will create new opportunities for Google Cloud across its product portfolio. Out of the 37 analyst ratings given to GOOGL stock, 29 are Buys, eight are Holds, and none are Sells, indicating a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average GOOGL stock price target is $165.28, indicating upside potential of 6.7% from current levels. Analysts tracking GOOGL stock expect adjusted earnings to expand from $5.80 per share in 2023 to $6.81 per share in 2024 and $7.85 per share in 2025. So, priced at 22.8x forward earnings, Google stock is not too expensive, even though it trades at a higher multiple than peers, as its bottom line is forecast to grow by more than 15% annually in the next two years.  Alphabet is a company firing on all cylinders. Despite its massive size, the tech behemoth continues to grow revenue and earnings at an enviable pace while improving profit margins. Additionally, its investments in AI should equip Alphabet with the resources to gain traction in the highly disruptive market over time. Disclosure\n"

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips The Metaverse is one of the most exciting concepts today, promising unlimited possibilities in a fully accessible virtual environment. While it will likely take many years before it becomes a reality, investors can begin to seek out the best Metaverse stocks to buy in April to profit the most from what could become a worldwide phenomenon. The stocks listed represent companies with technology and software that put them in a fantastic position to profit immensely from the emergence of the Metaverse. In the long term, as the Metaverse inches closer, these stocks will grow along with the Metaverse. Let’s learn more about the specific offerings these companies will bring to the table, making them the best Metaverse stocks to buy in April. What makes the Metaverse so appealing to the world is the potential to create and share ideas and content that could never exist in reality. To make this possible, the Metaverse will need software like Cloudflare (NYSE:NET) and its top-rated Content Delivery Network (CDN). Sharing peak speed and performance is essential to making the Metaverse what it needs to be.  In addition to content delivery, Cloudflare offers two other indispensable pieces to the Metaverse puzzle: security and storage. Cloudlfare’s zero-trust security solution provides traffic control and data protection to a vast network worldwide. The sheer size of the Metaverse and all its data will require a massive storage system. Cloudflare is also positioned to become a secure storage option with its enormous R2 storage solutions compatible with its CDN. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a leading cloud computing software provider, and its product is Microsoft Azure. Azure provides users everywhere with access to applications of all kinds in a 100% virtual network. The Metaverse relies on the ability to present creative capabilities to users that are not possible anywhere else. The best way to do so is to utilize generative AI to expand the limits of content creation immensely. Microsoft is setting itself up to be the backbone of providing this service on such a scale through a multi-year, multi-billion dollar partnership with OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT. OpenAI is at the forefront of generative AI, and this partnership ensures it uses Azure exclusively for its cloud computing needs.  To further its position as a key piece of the Metaverse, Microsoft has solidified itself in another relevant field: gaming. Gaming, specifically VR games, will undoubtedly contribute to Metaverse demand. To set itself at the forefront of gaming, Microsoft recently completed its acquisition of Activision Blizzard, a world-renowned gaming company. Meta (NASDAQ:META) is leading the Metaverse and investing heavily in its development. Reality Labs is part of Meta and is responsible for developing VR technology and software. Reality Labs offers VR hardware, such as the Oculus VR headset and Ray-Ban smart glasses. Though sales have not been ideal for these products, they continue to perform better than similar products on the market. Meta continues to lead the charge, investing billions more than competitors in VR software. Though Meta has suffered losses over the previous year, its investment in the future and the Metaverse is unmatched. When the Metaverse takes off, you can bet that Meta will be the first to benefit, and investors with faith in VR’s potential should start with this stock.

      "(RTTNews) - Several users of Microsoft Outlook have recently reported facing issues with their legitimate emails being blocked after Google implemented new mandatory bulk sender authentication requirements for Gmail. The issue has caused frustration among some Outlook users as their emails to Gmail recipients are being flagged as spam, and they are unable to reach their intended audience. Microsoft has acknowledged the problem and confirmed that some users with Outlook.com country domains are having trouble sending emails to Gmail accounts. The company has posted a notification on the Outlook.com support page to inform its users about the situation. According to the notification, affected Outlook users are receiving subsequent emails from Gmail's servers notifying them that their messages were deemed suspicious and prevented from reaching the recipient's inbox. While Microsoft investigates the situation, they have suggested a temporary solution until a permanent fix is put in place. The solution is to add an Outlook.com alias to accounts and use that alias to send emails to Gmail users. Outlook aliases are additional email addresses connected to the Outlook.com account, sharing the same inbox, contact list, and account settings as the primary email address.  Microsoft has not provided any detailed information about the cause of the issue, but they have stated that affected users should utilize the proposed remedy until the Outlook team resolves the problem. Google is now blocking emails from bulk senders who do not adhere to stricter spam thresholds and authentication requirements outlined in new guidelines aimed at enhancing defenses against spam, phishing attacks, and malware. Starting in June, Google will enforce these new requirements to prevent spam, phishing, and malware from reaching users' inboxes. The new guidelines are part of Google's efforts to provide its users with a safe and secure email experience.\n",
      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips While the idea of digital immersion might seem suited exclusively for video games, that’s not necessarily the case, boding well for virtual reality stocks. And even the innovation centered only on entertainment, that’s not a bad place to be. According to Grand View Research, the video game market reached a valuation of $217.06 billion in 2022. By 2030, the sector could print revenue of $583.69 billion, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.4%. For VR, the sector could be worth $435.36 billion, representing a CAGR of 27.5% from 2023. Stated differently, you ignore this space at the risk of incurring an opportunity cost. With that, below are three virtual reality stocks to consider. Formerly known as Facebook, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) apparently got tired owning the world’s largest online social network. As a result, the company has shifted its focus aggressively on the metaverse. A lot of folks make this concept more difficult than it needs to be. It’s really a virtualization medium that allows users to interact with others in a computer-generated environment.  Now, I’ll freely admit that some of Meta’s metaverse proposals are a bit out there. Case in point is the office virtualization thingy, which in my opinion is dystopian: just go to the darn office already! However, if I remove my bias, I can acknowledge that there’s plenty of potential in terms of utilitarian connectivity protocols. What matters most regarding virtual reality stocks, though, is performance. Last fiscal year, the company beat all its quarterly bottom-line targets. Its best print came during the third quarter, when earnings per share of $4 beat the target of $3.31. For the current fiscal year, analysts are looking for EPS of $20 on revenue of $158.25 billion. That’s a massive improvement over last year’s results of $14.87 EPS on sales of $134.9 billion. A gargantuan player in the software department, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) shows no sign of curbing its ambitions. It’s really a leader across multiple innovation categories, including artificial intelligence. As a result, it’s not surprising that it ranks among the top virtual reality stocks. In particular, I see huge potential for its mixed reality headset called HoloLens. To be fair, it’s not a pure-play VR solution. However, Microsoft is pushing the boundaries of what is possible, integrating the best virtualization technologies and juxtaposing them with real-life protocols. With HoloLens, workers in technical and critical fields – let’s say heavy machinery and medical care – can receive invaluable training. And they can also receive guidance in an environment where mistakes won’t have deadly consequences.  Financially, Microsoft is a handy lead-off batter. It doesn’t really hit home runs but it gets on base. That’s important for winning games over a long season. For fiscal 2024, analysts project EPS of $11.65 on revenue of $244.22 billion. That’s a big improvement over last year’s result of $9.81 on sales of $211.91 billion. As a multinational semiconductor contract manufacturing and design company, Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) is not a pure-play candidate for virtual reality stocks. However, VR applications and hardware won’t get very far with advanced computer chips. Indeed, as The Wall Street Journal argued, a case can be made that TSMC is the world’s most important company. Ultimately, any high-powered application or protocol – whether it be generative AI or VR – requires incredible processing capacity. TSMC provides the computing power necessary to move the world’s latest and greatest tech advancements. Should VR expand in scope and scale (which is what’s happening), TSM stock should continue charging higher. Notably, it’s up over 38% this year. For fiscal 2024, analysts believe EPS will land at $5.76. That’s up noticeably from last year’s print of $5.19. On the top line, they’re calling for revenue to reach $84.34 billion, up 21.5% from last year’s result of $69.4 billion. Given how important TSMC is to not only VR but other innovations, it’s easily a name to consider.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips In a politically divisive ecosystem, about the only thing we can achieve bipartisanship on are Nancy Pelosi stocks. Yes, the former House Speaker herself represents a lightning rod for controversy. Yet she seems to know her way around the market. That’s not surprising. Love her or not love her (let’s not get too negative here), we must respect her shrewd gamesmanship and intellect. Of course, depending on where you land in the political spectrum, you’re going to disagree with that last point. That’s okay. The point is you can’t be a complete fool to be elected to Congress. Well, maybe I shouldn’t have said that. Let’s move on – below are still-relevant Nancy Pelocy stocks still worth buying in the second quarter. Falling under the broader technology ecosystem, Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) plies its trade in the software infrastructure space. Specifically, it’s one of the top names in the cybersecurity realm, an increasingly important arena. While we talk a great game about rising innovations such as artificial intelligence, they also potentially leave us vulnerable to nefarious activities.  Fundamentally, it’s one of the Nancy Pelosi stocks to buy for the obvious reason that cybercriminals will continue committing crimes. What’s worse, AI could lower the threshold for budding hackers, making enterprise security all the more relevant. Therefore, it’s not at all surprising that in the last fiscal year, the company beat all four quarterly bottom-line targets. For the current fiscal year, analysts anticipate earnings per share of $5.50. That’s a significant increase over last year’s print of $4.44. On the top line, they believe revenue could reach $7.98 billion. Again, that’s a noticeable bump (15.8%) over fiscal 2023’s $6.89 billion tally. It’s easily one of the Nancy Pelosi stocks to buy in Q2. Consumer technology giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) needs no introduction, if only for the reason that there’s a very good chance you own one of its products. If viewership metrics are anything to go by, there’s also a solid chance you’re reading this on an Apple device. Naturally, AAPL stock makes for a solid investment despite pressures against the economy. Yes, discretionary spending faces significant headwinds. That’s not a shocking statement after years of high inflation and high borrowing costs. Nevertheless, Apple has a social cachet that can’t be ignored. People need its products even though technically, they don’t need it. Such a backdrop has led to consistent profitability. Last fiscal year, Apple beat all its quarterly bottom-line targets. For the current fiscal year, analysts are looking for EPS of $6.56. That’s a decent bump from last year’s metric of $6.13. On the revenue front, we’re not looking at great numbers: an average estimate of $387.95 billion against last year’s print of $383.29 billion. Still, for overall stability, AAPL could make a solid case for Nancy Pelosi stocks to buy.  Another big play among Nancy Pelosi stocks that requires no introduction, I’m definitely using Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) products to write this story. So, you know who to blame. In all seriousness, Microsoft’s Software as a Service (SaaS) is an indispensable asset in the business or academic world. You can play around with other platforms but when things need to get done, Microsoft is the name (almost) everyone turns to. Yes, the spotlight centers on the company’s major investments in AI. So far, this directive has proved very lucrative. Nevertheless, I like Microsoft for its everyday relevancies: the aforementioned SaaS as well as its practically universal operating system and cloud-computing network. It’s difficult to imagine life without the tech juggernaut. Unsurprisingly, it has been consistently profitable. For fiscal year 2024, analysts are seeking EPS of $11.65, well above last year’s print of $9.81. Notably, even the least-optimistic projection stands at $11.40. For revenue, we’re talking about $244.22 billion, up a massive 15.2% from last year’s haul of $211.91 billion. I think it’s a buy, irrespective of the Nancy Pelosi connection. Even with the vaunted category of Nancy Pelosi stocks, you come across some tricky narratives. For me, that would be American Express (NYSE:AXP). Don’t get me wrong – I think it’s a fine company. You never leave home without it, am I right? Still, with so many Americans indebted (to the tune of over $1 trillion), I’m a bit concerned about credit-card companies.  Let’s get that out of the way first. Having said that, let me also say that if I had to invest in a credit card company, it would be AXP stock. Why? American Express generally caters to a wealthier clientele. And so, even with rising plastic delinquencies, AmEx customers should be the least impacted. It’s still a tricky play though. In the first and fourth quarters last year, the company missed analysts’ EPS targets. Looking to the end of fiscal 2024, experts believe that AmEx will post EPS of $12.80. That’s up noticeably from last year’s print of $11.21. For revenue, we’re looking at $66.15 billion, up 9.3% from 2023’s tally of $60.52 billion. To start, Disney (NYSE:DIS) is one of the Nancy Pelosi stocks that the namesake legislator has been selling. It’s understandable. While the entertainment giant – which features an enviable content library along with a portfolio of theme parks and resorts – commands a massive brand, it has also struggled since late 2021. Still, a clear recovery is in play. Since the beginning of the year, DIS stock gained over 35% of equity value. Over the past 52 weeks, it’s up more than 23%. Sure, at this point, it does trade at 75.81X trailing-year earnings. As well, it runs a sales premium of 2.52X last year’s revenue. Nevertheless, it’s also possible that the entertainment leader is attempting to return to its throne. I think it’s worth considering. In Q1 2023, Disney met the analysts’ EPS target of 93 cents. From Q2 to Q4, the positive earnings surprise came out to 8.4%, then 17.1%, finally culminating at 23.2%. That’s earnings growth if I’ve ever seen it.  For fiscal 2024, analysts are looking for EPS of $4.68 against last year’s result of $3.76. Given the trend, it’s a solid wager. The former House speaker has both bought and sold shares of tech juggernaut Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Most recently, she has trimmed her exposure to GOOGL stock. Still, even without her direct show of support, I think it’s one of the Nancy Pelosi stocks to consider. Yes, GOOGL has enjoyed a solid run, moving up 48% in the past 52 weeks. There could still be more gains to be had. One of the criticisms against Alphabet is that it’s not particularly winning the generative AI game. Microsoft’s investment in OpenAI and its chatbot ChatGPT has taken the world by storm. Alphabet’s Gemini (previously called Bard) is okay but doesn’t have first-mover advantage. Still, as I argued previously, Alphabet could eventually tweak its platform to become a true AI winner. It practically owns the internet so an exploitable synergy exists. For fiscal 2024, covering experts believe EPS will reach $6.81. That’s a big jump from last year’s print of $5.80. Also, they’re looking for revenue to land at $342.34 billion. Again, we’re talking a large gap from last year’s result of $307.39 billion. Finally, we come to the riskiest idea among Nancy Pelosi stocks, financial technology (fintech) stalwart PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL). It’s so risky that she decided to sell it. I can understand the decision and I’d say it’s worked out for her. While PYPL is up more than 5% since the beginning of the year, it’s down 14% in the trailing year. Obviously, that’s not encouraging amid wider tech bullishness.  Still, I’m not ready to abandon ship on PYPL just yet. For example, with the Covid-19 crisis imparting massive changes in the workforce, the gig economy could rise higher than expected. That would certainly be the case as more companies demand a return to the office. It’s also interesting to note that PayPal has performed quite well last year against bottom-line targets. For fiscal year 2024, analysts are looking for EPS of $5.07. That’s a bit disappointing compared to last year’s result of $5.10. However, revenue might land at $31.86 billion. If so, that would be a 7% bump from last year’s tally of $29.77 billion. It’s worth looking into if you’re a contrarian.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Keep an eye on some of the most undervalued semiconductor stocks to buy in April. According to Global Data, the “overall AI market will be worth $909 billion by 2030, registering a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 35% between 2022 and 2030. In the generative AI space, revenues are expected to grow from $1.8 billion in 2022 to $33 billion in 2027 at a CAGR of 80%.” Even better, according to Fortune Business Insights, the global semiconductor market could be worth nearly $1.4 trillion from $527.9 billion in 2021. Plus, according to The Semiconductor Industry Association, chip sales could explode 13% higher this year to $595.3 billion. That’s all thanks to the surging demand for AI and automotive chips. For an idea of potential upside with related stocks, just look at Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).  Since the start of 2023, the tech giant ran from a low of about $150 to a current price of $894. Nvidia could push even higher with surging demand for its AI chips. According to PYMNTS.com, “The demand for Nvidia’s chips has been soaring, with the company forecasting 233% growth in first-quarter revenue, exceeding market expectations.” Given the multiple catalysts, here are three of the most undervalued semiconductor stocks to buy in April. Weakness is opportunity in Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). After dropping from about $230 to around $170, the AMD stock is now consolidating at $178.70. From here, I’d like to see it again challenge $230 in the near term. In the long term, I’d like to see AMD well above $300 a share as AI chip demand grows. Surging along with Nvidia, it’s another one of the top semiconductor stocks to buy on every dip. With growing exposure to AI, it just launched its MI200X AI GPU, which competes with Nvidia’s offerings and is expanding into AI-personal computers. AMD is also working with cloud giants like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL).  Helping, analysts over at Melius Research increased its price target on AMD to $265 from $192, with a Buy rating. “With Microsoft as an anchor — and other clouds now picking up — AMD can generate more upside in AI vs. prior estimates,” the firm added. I’d also take advantage of the recent dip in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) — another one of the most undervalued semiconductor stocks to buy in April. After testing a high of $158.40, TSM is now consolidating around $140.22. From here, I’d initially like to see it retest its prior high. Helping, analyst Mehdi Hosseini is out with a positive rating on the stock with a new, higher price target of $180 from $160. Plus, the company has already said that business has bottomed out and that growing demand for artificial intelligence will help boost revenues. It also doesn’t hurt that the company manufactures chips for other behemoth companies like Advanced Micro Devices and Nvidia. In addition, as noted on Seeking Alpha, “Demand for AI-optimized chips is outstripping supply, which puts Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing into an admirable position and which could justify further valuation gains. The chipmaker said in January that it expects 20% top-line growth in FY 2024 due to [SIC] favorable supply-demand imbalances as industries around the world are racing to adapt to the AI revolution.”  We can also look at Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL), which is starting to pivot higher after falling from a high of about $85 to a recent low of $65. Last trading at $73.59, I’d like to see MRVL retest its prior high. Helping, the company recently declared a quarterly dividend of six cents, payable on May 1 to shareholders of record as of April 12. MRVL also authorized another $3 billion to the balance of its existing stock repurchase program, increasing the total current repurchase authority to about $3.3 billion. In addition, Citi (NYSE:C) just opened a 30-day catalyst watch on the MRVL stock ahead of its AI event on April 11. “If recent history is any guide, snatching up shares of Marvell Technology ahead of its upcoming artificial intelligence presentation could potentially pay off for investors, according to Citi,” as noted by CNBC. The firm also has a Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $91, noting that MRVL’s data center business led by AI is a bright spot.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips SoundHound AI stock (NASDAQ:SOUN) has a rapidly growing business, promising technology, an impressive list of customers, and an investment from Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Moreover, SOUN’s partnership with Nvidia could eventually generate a great deal of revenue for the smaller firm, tremendously lifting Soundhound AI stock in the process. On the other hand, however, SoundHound’s valuation remains extremely high, and there are signs that investors have bec9ome cautious about the name as a result of this situation. Moreover, a research firm which is selling SoundHound AI stock short made several disturbing, ominous allegations about the firm last month. Given these negative qualities, I recommend that investors sell SOUN stock at this point. As I noted in a previous column, SOUN’s technology “‘translates spoken inputs directly into conversational AI,’ according to Seeking Alpha columnist Gary Alexander.” On the other hand, competing products alter “speech to text, then translate that text into meaning,” Alexander explained. SOUN’s method is likely meaningfully faster and more accurate.  Moreover, the firm has multiple, huge customers, including “including Oracle (NYSE: ORCL ), Square (NYSE: SQ ), Hyundai , and Stellantis’ (NYSE: STLA ) Jeep unit.” Also noteworthy is that Nvidia has acquired 1.7 million shares of SOUN stock, and the firms are partnering on “an innovative, generative-AI-enabled in-vehicle voice platform,” another InvestorPlace columnist David Moadel, reported on April 1. It’s certainly possible that the two companies, working together, could improve SoundHound’s technology and convince many more companies to adopt SOUN’s offering. I wouldn’t even be shocked if Nvidia acquires SOUN at some point down the road. SoundHound’s enterprise value/revenue ratio is a stratospheric 37.66 times. Indicating that the Street is somewhat wary of that huge valuation, investment bank Northland Capital on Feb. 28 cut its rating on SOUN to “market perform” from “outperform.” Of course, the bank cited valuation as the main reason for the downgrade. Moreover, the shares tumbled from their intraday peak of $8.80 on March 15 to $5.45 in pre-market trading on April 2.  Likely contributing to the Street’s recent lack of enthusiasm for the name was a March 19 report on the company issued by Capybara Research. In the past, I have found that detailed reports on companies issued by short sellers tend to have at least some valid allegations. Capybara alleges that “Multiple large customers have paid SoundHound to cancel their contracts,” while the firm has a ” istory of losing large contracts.” According to the short seller, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Deutsche Telekom, and Mercedes-Benz have all canceled their deals with SoundHound. Further, the firm reported that SOUN’s “speech recognition tech is a commodity service that competes with comparable products from” offered by many other firms, including Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Finally, the firm reports that SoundHound has been losing customers to Cerence, its “largest competitor in the automotive space.” If these assertions are true or even mostly accurate, it’s reasonable to conclude that SoundHound’s offering is not very unique, that a significant number of its customers have not been pleased with its offering, and that the firm is losing market share. SoundHound’s valuation is huge, while there’s a good possibility that the company has indeed been shedding major customer and losing market share. As a result of these deveopments, the Street’s fascination with the company appears to have disappeared.  While I continue to believe that SOUN has a great deal of potential, due to its high valuation, the Street’s caution towards the name, and the short seller’s allegations, I view its risk-reward ratio as quite negative.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Being the king of AI chip stocks, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is surely a piping hot stock every long-term growth investor is itching to own. Surging nearly 250% in 2023, Nvidia stock is up more than 85% year-to-date, and showing not signs of slowing down anytime soon. Of course, most of this drastic valuation increase has to do with Nvidia’s stranglehold on the high-performance computing market. The company’s AI semiconductors and GPUs are the dominant option for companies worldwide looking to create AI applications and run interfaces in this high-growth space. Until that changes, this rally really does look unstoppable. Today, most sectors, whether it’s from in technology or elsewhere, are looking to pivot into AI or integrate AI into their processes. Analysts predict the AI market could reach $2 trillion by 2030, with plenty of value being accrued to the current dominant leader in this space. Here’s why I think Nvidia’s current multiple has been validated by the market, and could actually represent a reasonable level, given the company’s noted ability to outperform in terms of its fundamentals.  Tech giants everywhere are collaborating to counter Nvidia’s AI dominance. This speaks to the company’s dominant position in this space, resulting in the formation of the Unified Acceleration Foundation (UXL). The coalition, including Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and others, aims to develop open-source software enabling AI code to run universally. This group targets a mature project phase by year-end. After reaching a $2 trillion market cap, Nvidia stock is more driven to create AI-focused hardware that can be even better than its existing H100 and H200 chips. Despite Nvidia’s dominance with CUDA architecture, rivals are developing alternatives amid chip scarcity. UXL aims to create open-source solutions for AI and computing, seeking collaboration from chipmakers and cloud giants—Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) rumored partnership with AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) is yet another example of competitive interests lining up against Nvidia stock. I think this reality is largely bullish for Nvidia right now. It showcases the company’s dominance, and while other lower-priced options are necessary, means that Nvidia’s positioning in the high-performance computing space will be hard to challenge. I think Nvidia’s moat is only getting wider, with the release of its recent Blackwell GPU the latest innovation to turn heads. The previous year, Nvidia dominated the AI chip market with an estimated 90% share, leading to remarkable earnings. In its latest quarter (Q4 of fiscal 2024, ending in January), revenue surged by 265% to $22 billion, with operating income soaring by 983% to nearly $14 billion. This growth was fueled by a 409% increase in data center revenue, driven by AI GPU sales. The company’s free cash flow skyrocketed by 430% to over $27 billion, surpassing AMD’s $1 billion and Intel’s notable $14 billion. Despite the competition’s new GPU releases, Nvidia’s AI advantage likely propelled it ahead, ensuring robust cash reserves for continued innovation and market leadership. Moreover, the company now sits in third place in the race to be the world’s most valuable company, just behind Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft.  Despite this rapid growth, Nvidia’s stock has appreciated over the past year. Key valuation metrics like the price-earnings ratio and price-to-free-cash-flow ratio indicate favorable investment potential, coupled with its leading position in a thriving industry and substantial cash reserves. During an Nvidia event last week, Jensen Huang introduced Blackwell, Nvidia’s revolutionary GPU architecture, poised to redefine computing. Named after David Blackwell, this ambitious project marks a significant milestone in Silicon Valley’s history. Nvidia exceeded Q4 earnings estimates, soaring revenue by 265% to $22.1 billion. The company anticipates 2024 sales of around $24 billion and an implied bottom line of $5.41 per share. Analyst Timothy Arcuri raised Nvidia’s price target to $1,100, citing an expected surge in demand. Arcuri likened the framework to a centralized distribution system akin to an app store, foreseeing significant revenue potential from licensing Nvidia’s AI Enterprise software at $4,500 per GPU per year. He advocated for capitalizing on any short-term declines as buying opportunities. Nvidia has clearly emerged as a leading AI stock, and while some of the stock’s recent rise can be tied to hype, most of this company’s performance is fundamentals-based. Indeed, despite surging roughly more than three-fold over the past 18 months, this is a stock that still looks reasonably-valued based on its forward-looking prospects.  The data center and professional visualization segments saw remarkable sales growth of over 400% and 100% year-over-year. Additionally, Nvidia announced its inaugural quarterly dividend, offering investors promising fundamentals and growth prospects, particularly in the AI sector. For long-term investors, Nvidia remains the go-to option in this space. I just don’t see that changing, for at least the next decade. Accordingly, I think investors would do well to consider this stock on dips moving forward.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips There are many paths investors can take to profit on Wall Street but one of the best strategies is buying dividend stocks. History shows that income stocks outperform all other stocks. Going as far back as 1930, there has never been a losing decade for dividend stocks on the S&P 500. Dividend Aristocrats are the cream of income-generating stocks. These are companies that not only pay a dividend but have raised their payouts for 25 years or more. Moreover, to qualify for the list, they also have to be a component of the S&P 500 index. Only 67 stocks out of the thousands that trade on the market have made the cut. Yet the list is always changing. Some companies cross that 25-year threshold and received the crown. Others fall by the wayside because they can’t maintain their payments. Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) was kicked out earlier this year after it slashed its payout to save money. Below are seven of the best stocks close to becoming Dividend Aristocrats. Consider buying them for your own portfolio.  Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is the largest defense contractor with virtually all of its $67.6 billion in annual revenue derived from government contracts. The military and aerospace leader is involved in all the major military programs. It builds F-16 and F22 fighter jets, F-35 stealth fighters, the Patriot missile systems, Javelin anti-tank weapons systems, Black Hawk helicopters, Trident ballistic missiles, and NASA’s Orion spacecraft. Many of these weapons and defense systems are also sold to foreign governments. Not surprisingly, constructing the global war machine is extremely profitable. LMT stock’s net earnings last year totalled $6.9 billion, or $27.55 per share, up 21% from last year. The defense giant pays a dividend that totals $12.60 per share annually and yields a healthy 2.8%. As Lockheed generates generous amounts of free cash flow, some $6.2 billion in 2023, the dividend is well covered. And with a free cash flow (FCF) payout ratio of 49%, there is plenty of room for future growth. Last October, Lockheed raised the dividend for the 21st consecutive year. It only needs to do that four more times to reach Aristocrat status, which seems easily within the defense behemoth’s reach. Everyone knows Clorox (NYSE:CLX) for its namesake bleach but the consumer products leader has a portfolio of other brands including Pine-Sol cleaners, Kingsford charcoal and Glad storage bags. Clorox products tend to be the leading brands in their respective markets and generate 80% of its $7.4 billion in annual net sales from brands holding  the No. 1 or No. 2 market share position.  After a rough couple of years following the pandemic boom, Clorox then suffered a major cyberattack last August that disrupted supply chains, interfered with production and caused product shortages. Now CLX stock is on the mend. Shares are up 6% in 2024 and it is enjoying 20% non-GAAP organic sales growth for the first half of its current fiscal year. The consumer products company is rebuilding inventories ahead of schedule, driving top line growth and rebuilding margins. Gross margins jumped 730 basis points in the fiscal second quarter, hitting 43.5%. There is still work to do but Clorox’s dividend remains secure. The bleach maker has increased the payout for 21 straight years and with a free cash flow payout ratio of 62%, there is sufficient cushion for additional growth and expansion. Chipmaker Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is the third stock on the brink of becoming a Dividend Aristocrat. The smartphone chip supplier for both Android and iOS devices also has a 21-year record of raising its dividend, which yields 1.9% annually. We’ve been focusing on the free cash flow payout ratio with these candidates because companies can only do so much with the money they have left over after paying their bills. Rewarding shareholders with dividends is one of them. For Qualcomm, it uses just 35% of its FCF meaning there is little danger of the dividend being cut.  That’s because the chipmaker’s business is booming. Perhaps not so much as rival Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), but fiscal first quarter results showed revenue jumped to $9.9 billion primarily due to 16% growth in its handset chip business. Even as the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 15 ramp settles down, Samsung’s Galaxy S24 smartphone should provide the next leg of its road higher. The chipmaker is also benefiting from a recovery of demand in China. Sure, QCOM stock is no Nvidia but it doesn’t have to be and it remains a solid semiconductor stock to buy. Footwear maker Nike (NYSE:NKE) has been a laggard in 2024 with its stock down a harsh 15%. It is one of the worst-performing S&P 500 stocks due to stiff competition from competing shoemakers, like Deckers Outdoor (NASDAQ:DECK) Hoka brand and Adidas (OTCMKTS:ADDYY). Business in China is also slow. Yet things may be changing up for the sports apparel company. Although it is still sorting through focusing on direct-to-consumer outlets versus the wholesale market, China is rebounding. Fiscal third-quarter earnings showed currency-adjusted sales up 6% there with revenue across the nine months of its fiscal year running 8% higher. NKE stock is down 28% from its recent high but now trades at some of its lowest levels in years. On a price-to-sales basis, the stock is about where it was a decade ago, and it’s no different with its price-to-earnings ratio.  Some might say the discount is appropriate because of its slowed momentum but it continues to produce substantial cash flows. While Nike has raised its dividend for 22  years running, over the past five years it has been increasing it at a 10% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR). FCF has expanded at a similar CAGR and with a 41% FCF payout ratio, NKE stock’s dividend has more room to move. Electric power utility Southern (NYSE:SO) should be a surprise member of the soon-to-be Dividend Aristocrat list. Utilities are cherished for their stable growth and dividend payments, which is why they were often considered widows-and-orphans stocks. Southern is a gas and electric utility generating power for across much of the south, appropriately enough. It also operates nuclear power facilities and put Plant Vogtle Unit 3 into operation last July. The plant is the first new construction facility in the U.S. in over 30 years. It anticipates putting Unit 4 into service some time in the second quarter. Over the past decade, SO stock delivered 135% total return for investors. While that is below the average of the S&P 500, you don’t buy into utilities for their growth momentum but the surety of its dividend payments. Southern’s dividend yields 3.9% annually and the company has grown the payout for 22 consecutive years. Nuclear power is back into vogue. An all-of-the-above solution is needed as energy demands exceed the capacity of renewables. Expect SO stock and its dividend to keep growing.  At this mature stage of its lifecycle, it remains surprising to see Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) reinvent itself once again. As InvestorPlace’s Louis Navellier recently noted, the tech giant may be the ultimate artificial intelligence (AI) growth play for the next decade.” Having integrated AI into the very fabric of its operations, MSFT stock is now joined at the hip with this technological leap forward. Microsoft invested billions of dollars in OpenAI and put its ChatGPT generative AI to work in Bing search, the Office suite of products and its fast-growing Azure cloud services business. It has given the tech leader a new lease on life and accelerated its potential. Microsoft is now the world’s most valuable company with a $3.1 trillion valuation. This potential could equally apply to the dividend, which Microsoft has increased every year after initiating the payout in 2003. The company generates massive FCF, so $63 billion worth last year. It’s grown FCF 9% annually for the past decade, an amazing achievement considering this company’s size. That puts its FCF payout ratio at just 33%, which ensures investors will enjoy future increases for years to come. The last stock to consider buying before it becomes a Dividend Aristocrat is another utility, this one serving the New England states of Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire. Eversource Energy (NYSE:ES) is on the doorstep of aristocracy after raising the payout in February by almost 6% to 71.5 cents per share. That gives it a 24-year history of increasing its dividend. This time next year could see it rubbing elbows with its royal neighbors. Investors might see their holdings significantly higher too. After a steady climb higher, ES stock stagnated during the pandemic and has since been in decline. It’s down 40% from its March 2020 high. The stock is down 24% in the last year alone. The regulated utility is reeling from exiting several offshore wind projects last year and took a $1.6 billion charge in the fourth quarter. It is also in the process of selling its 50% interest in the Sunrise Wind project in New York.  Eversource had been one of the first utilities to pursue wind energy projects but decided to completely abandon them two years ago. It should be fully free of the clean energy option when the Sunrise Wind project goes through. Now it will focus completely on its utility operations and can finance their transmission and distribution growth projects that will better earn a steady regulated return. The stock is already up 13% from its 52-week lows. With a narrow focus on core operations, analysts are upbeat it can continue growing its dividend and rewarding shareholders.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips The U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill on March 13 that stated a requirement for ByteDance, a reputable Chinese tech company, to ban TikTok in the United States. The legislation, now known as the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Application Act, was forwarded by the U.S. government Reps. Mike Gallagher (R-WI) and Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-IL) on March 5. On March 7, the legislation garnered approval from the Energy and Commerce Committee, as it has been concerned over TikTok’s control by a foreign adversary. As TikTok’s parent company, the bill is to compel ByteDance to sell its stake. Such legislation could lead to the app’s disappearance within six months in the United States. However, the bill also faces challenges in the Senate, which needs to it through to the president before it becomes an official law. Moreover, problems like TikTok’s close ties to China also loom in, adding more reason for lawmakers to ban the app due to possible security risks. Such risks include alleged data spying by the Chinese government. Although TikTok’s assurance of data protection, such as its very own Project Texas, is known, suspicion of user privacy is still a big concern for many in the U.S. government. While ByteDance has assured the public’s worries about data privacy and social media impact are unfounded, analysts still see that targeting TikTok for a ban is not a full solution.  In fact, whether foreign or domestic companies, such agencies have avenues to access sensitive information from the U.S. through digital trade. Therefore, sanctioning only one app will not address broader issues. The bill proceeds to the Senate amid uncertainty, with senators divided on its fate and previous attempts to ban TikTok stalling. A TikTok spokesperson criticized the secretive process, hoping the Senate would consider the impact on the economy and millions of users. TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew conveyed disappointment, stating the bill favors rival social media firms and harms creators and small businesses. Chew assured users of TikTok’s ongoing efforts to safeguard their data and platform integrity. He highlighted the potential consequences of the legislation, expressing TikTok’s commitment to legal action to protect its platform. President Biden, previously an advocate for the bill, pledged to sign it if passed, with the White House offering technical assistance in its development and passage through Congress. Despite House members asserting that the bill doesn’t ban TikTok, it mandates ByteDance divest the app within six months to keep it available in the United States. If passed, app stores and internet hosts would be barred from supporting TikTok and ByteDance-related apps. Lawmakers cited national security risks due to alleged ties to the Chinese Communist Party, claims refuted by Chew during congressional hearings. However, organizations like the ACLU and Knight Institute oppose the bill, fearing it infringes on First Amendment rights. Trump expressed concerns that banning TikTok would benefit Meta (NASDAQ:META).  Donald Trump’s remark, labeling Facebook an “enemy,” stood out, given his past efforts to remove TikTok over national security concerns. In 2020, his administration urged ByteDance to divest the app, prompting Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to consider acquisition. If the TikTok bill passes, Angelo Zino suggests its U.S. operations could be valued at over $60 billion. Zino speculated that ByteDance might opt to cease TikTok operations in the U.S. Keith Rabois, a notable venture capitalist, warned against Republicans opposing the TikTok legislation. TikTok creators explored diversifying their brands amid the looming ban. Upon joining TikTok before the Super Bowl, President Joe Biden’s inaugural post sparked interest, dissected by political scientist Maggie Macdonald for its self-awareness. Biden’s entry into the platform amid debates over TikTok’s presence in the U.S. underscored its dual role: a campaign tool and a security concern. The House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party proposed a bill mandating ByteDance to divest TikTok, threatening a U.S. ban. The bill advanced to the House floor following a unanimous 50-0 vote. Rep. Troy Balderson labeled TikTok a CCP surveillance tool, while Mr. Chew refuted any connections. TikTok criticized the move, citing potential infringements on free expression and economic impact. Since Biden’s lighthearted debut, his TikTok campaign amassed 274,700 followers and 3.2 million likes. As he faces a tight race against Trump, Biden aims to engage younger voters, crucial for mobilizing traditional Democratic support. Social media expert Aaron Earls emphasized Biden’s direct voter interaction for increased youth turnout.  During the State of the Union address, the president’s team shared speech clips on TikTok, signaling his commitment despite legislative concerns. White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre endorsed the bill, emphasizing outreach while ensuring national security measures. Biden pledged to sign if Congress approves. TikTok rallied users after the bill’s House advancement, prompting calls to lawmakers’ offices. The Senate’s stance on the bill remains to be determined. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) hasn’t committed to scheduling a vote despite bipartisan House support and the White House urging for prompt action. Senate processes typically move slower, and senators are set for a two-week break. Sen. Mike Rounds (R-SD) doesn’t anticipate immediate action, while Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-ND) suggested a prolonged timeline. The Senate Commerce Committee currently holds the bill, where similar proposals have stalled. Still deciding the legislation, the group’s chair, Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA), mentioned the possibility of a hearing and potential revisions. Cantwell emphasized the need for constitutional adherence but didn’t outline a timeline. Critics argue the bill infringes on the free speech of TikTok’s 170 million users, prompting calls for careful consideration from lawmakers like Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR). Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), the leading Republican on the Senate Commerce Committee, urged Chair Cantwell to schedule a markup swiftly. Cruz highlighted the need to discuss the bill’s language and potential amendments. However, the bill’s fate remains to be determined in the Senate, with Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA) expressing uncertainty about the timeline for any related legislation. If the House bill clears the Senate and gains presidential approval, it will be enacted into law. The legislation would then force ByteDance to face a TikTok ban within 180 days if it doesn’t sell its interest. However, for users doing business on TikTok, the bill could pose some financial and regulatory dilemmas.  Mr. Chew also addressed some challenges during discussions with U.S. lawmakers. He remarked that complying with the bill’s requirements was impractical and would ban the app nationwide. Previous attempts to restrict TikTok broadly in the U.S. failed, such as Montana’s ban, which a federal judge deemed unconstitutional. Calli Schroeder, a senior counsel at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, views attempts to ban TikTok as mere “security theater.” Legislators push such measures to appear proactive despite knowing they don’t tackle the core issues. Banning TikTok wouldn’t substantially impact China’s access to American data. While TikTok is already prohibited on federal and state-issued devices in many states, previous attempts like Montana’s ban faced legal challenges due to constitutionality and freedom of expression concerns. Kate Ruane, an attorney at the Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT), emphasized that banning TikTok won’t enhance data security. Numerous apps, including those owned by Chinese companies like WeChat and Alipay, also collect and distribute user data globally. Anne Toomey McKenna, a cyber law and privacy professor, suggested that singling out TikTok seemed more like political theater than adequate data security and privacy legislation. Numerous foreign and domestic tech companies, including LiveRamp (NYSE:RAMP), gather vast amounts of user data and then trade it globally by third-party brokers.  Data collection extends from smartphones and smart speakers to connected cars and dating apps. Social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram may appear free, but users pay with their data. These anonymized data, theoretically used for targeted advertising, often contain detailed personal information. A study found about 2,230 companies shared users’ data with Facebook. Governments worldwide, including the U.S., leverage these data markets to access extensive personal information without traditional legal processes. According to Politico, the Federal Trade Commission probed TikTok and ByteDance for misleading U.S. users about data access by individuals in China. Alleged violations of children’s privacy laws were also investigated. With the Justice Department, the FTC may litigate or negotiate a settlement. Even if the Senate approves the bill, TikTok plans to explore legal options before considering selling its U.S. operations. Former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin expressed interest in assembling a group to buy TikTok. However, major tech firms like Meta and Microsoft may refrain due to antitrust concerns. Any sale would also need Beijing’s approval, and the buyer might not gain access to TikTok’s proprietary algorithm. TikTok investors eye an IPO, but its value could decrease if it exits the U.S. market.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips When it comes to picking stocks, all of us want to ensure capital gains and steady returns. While the market cannot be timed, it is possible to pick stocks that have the potential to keep thriving, no matter the circumstances. Some companies have established themselves so well in the industry that no pandemic, war, or inflationary pressures can tamper its growth. Such blue-chip stocks to buy for under $500 in April can be an ideal addition to your portfolio before the companies announce results. Starting with $500? Buying these blue-chip gems right now will ensure you make the most of the upside in the coming months. While a few are nearing their 52-week highs, some are nearing the 52-week lows, giving you a chance to grab them at a discount. These stocks can survive any hail or storm and will end 2024 on a high note. Tech dinosaur Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the best blue-chip stocks to own. Trading at $424, the stock is up 14% year to date (YTD) and 47% in the year. Known for the operating system, Microsoft has become an integral part of our lives. It offers a wide range of products and services that cater to individuals and businesses. The Magnificent Seven stock could soar over $500 this year.  Its timely investments in OpenAI have helped the company integrate AI into its products and services which has reflected in the strong financials. Also, it launched AI for cybersecurity professionals this month. The company’s cloud business is one of the biggest revenue generators. It has shown a 24% growth in the recent quarter and came in at $33.7 billion out of the total company sales of $62 billion. Companies are willing to pay for their AI tools. So this is proof that it has been successful in the integration of AI into its products. Additionally, MSFT saw profit margins expand in Q2 and reported a net profit margin of over 25%. And, it can expand the margins further while steadily growing revenue. Finally, the company is well-positioned for the present and the future. Its AI prowess will ensure that it makes the most of the business opportunities. As one of the most valuable firms, Microsoft stock is a solid addition for all types of investors and will continue to reward them. A lot of people think Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is in trouble but don’t make the mistake of believing them. The company is indeed facing a lot of challenges at this point, but it has the potential to bounce back. While it has seen a drop in iPhone sales in China, it could only be temporary, and the sales could pick up soon. Also, the company is working on updating the operating system to iOS 18 and integrating AI into its phones. A dip in quarterly sales doesn’t mean that the company is losing the market. In fact, Apple has enough liquidity to keep going, and its services segment is growing at a record pace.  Down 8% YTD, APPL stock is getting close to its 52-week low of $159 – a solid chance to load up. Trading for $170 today, it has been on a downward spree since announcing quarterly results. With a drop in inflation, we can expect an improvement in consumer spending. So this could lead to an improvement in iPhone shipments. Also, the company is in talks to build the Gemini AI engine in its phone. While there hasn’t been a huge leap in terms of product features and improvements in the iPhone for several years, the company could bring something new this year and change the narrative. In short, it is too soon to give up on Apple stock right now. It is an attractive play with the potential to reward patient investors. E-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has come a long way from its humble beginning as a bookseller. The company is so much more than just an e-commerce business and has gained significant market share through its cloud services, Amazon Web Services (AWS). Currently, AWS holds a 31% market share. Amazon has always used AI to enhance customer experience, an investment that is paying off. It will invest an additional $2.75 billion in Anthropic, an AI startup company to advance its commitment towards generative AI.  AMZN stock is a blue-chip gem you should buy and hold forever. The company is one of the largest e-commerce companies and it provides everything online, including cars. Its cloud business is thriving and the advertising segment is going to become huge in the next two years. With the number of people visiting Amazon, marketers will be ready to pay for a top spot on the platform and this will ensure higher advertising revenue. The company will also spend $150 billion on data centers over the next decade to maintain its position in the cloud sector. When it comes to innovation, Amazon is the best out there. It reported impressive fourth-quarter results driven by holiday sales. Currently, the stock is trading at $180. While it is close to the 52-week high of $183, it could exceed $200 this year.

      "Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) has emerged as a key player in the semiconductor industry poised for significant growth, particularly with Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), the parent company of Facebook, stepping into the spotlight as its next multi-billion-dollar AI ASIC partner. With a focus on cutting-edge technology and strategic partnerships, Broadcom’s trajectory toward expansion and market dominance is becoming increasingly apparent. Analysts are busy reviewing the stock for any direction as to future trajectory. JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur shed light on Broadcom’s promising trajectory, particularly with Meta emerging as the “next multi-billion dollar per year AI ASIC customer.” With an Overweight rating and a price target of $1,700 by December 2024, Broadcom is poised for substantial gains. Also Read: AI Expansion Fuels Broadcom Surge: Stock Chart Signals Further Upside Broadcom has been successful in capturing next-gen 3nm AI ASIC chip wins at both Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) dba Google and Meta. These wins are expected to significantly contribute to Broadcom’s revenues, with projections indicating Meta becoming the next “multi-billion-dollar customer” for Broadcom’s AI ASIC solutions.  Over the past five years, Broadcom has established itself as a leader in custom chip (ASIC) development, particularly in collaboration with tech giants like Google and Meta. These partnerships have driven Broadcom’s AI ASIC revenues to over $9 billion this year, up from $3.5 billion last year. According to Sur, Broadcom is on track to release its 3nm AI accelerator (TPU) custom chip programs with Google (TPU v6) and Meta (MTIA TPU) by mid-2024. The ramp-up in production is expected to occur in the second half of the year and continue through 2025 “Overall we estimate that Google and Meta combined will drive $9B+ in AI ASIC chip revenues for Broadcom this year, (Google ~$8B+ and Meta around $500M-$1B), up almost 2.5x over CY23,” the analyst wrote. Sur also drew attention to the fact that Broadcom has “won follow-on/next-gen 3nm AI TPU ASIC wins at both customers targeted for tape-out in CY25 with ramp in back-half 25 and into CY26.” Broadcom’s advancements in its 2nm ASIC platform further support this sustained growth in AI ASIC revenues, with the platform already securing its first win with a high-performance computing customer.  The company anticipates achieving total AI semiconductor shipments of $10-$12 billion this year, driven by the expected increase in demand from its third AI ASIC customer, likely Bytedance/TikTok, and strong market interest in Broadcom’s Tomahawk 5 and Jericho 3 switching/routing chipsets, as well as its PCIe Gen5/Gen6 switching solutions. This projection signifies a growth of 2.5X compared to the figures recorded in 2023. Overall, Broadcom’s ASIC design win and revenue pipeline remain robust, bolstered by strong AI-driven demand in the networking semiconductor market. With anticipated positive revenue and EPS revisions throughout the year, Broadcom positions itself for continued success and growth in the AI semiconductor industry. AVGO Price Action: Shares of Broadcom were down 0.25% to $1336.10 on Monday.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Many investors dream of getting in early on the next big tech startup that will turn into a behemoth like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) or Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Finding and investing in the next unicorn company while it is still in its infancy would lead to almost unfathomable returns. However, picking winners is easier said than done. For every Google or Facebook, thousands of failed startups and penny stocks never amount to much. It’s like trying to find the proverbial needle in a haystack. While it may be next to impossible to predict which fledgling tech companies will become the next Google, that doesn’t mean you can’t generate substantial returns from investing in tech penny stocks. The key is being selective and sticking with quality companies that have a big growth runway and a viable path to profitability. Many of today’s tech giants were once small, speculative tech stocks. Buying these penny tech stocks in their early days can pay off in a big way over the long run. CI&T (NYSE:CINT) is an AI-powered digital products company that I believe could deliver multibagger returns from its current cheap valuation. In addition to AI, the company is involved in other hot growth sectors like cloud services. The stock has been consolidating sideways for the past couple of months but appears to be bottoming out. I expect shares to start cruising higher again soon on the back of robust growth and expanding margins. The consensus earnings estimates for CI&T paint quite a bullish growth picture. EPS is projected to skyrocket from 28 cents in fiscal 2024 to $1.10 in 2027. Not too shabby! On the top line, revenues are forecast to more than double from $448 million to $932 million over that same period.  You’re paying just 4.1 times 2027 earnings. Once sentiment shifts back in favor of growth, this stock could be off to the races. WidePoint (NYSEMKT:WYY) is a tiny technology management service provider catering to government and business clients across North America and Europe. The company’s Trusted Mobility Management (TM2) solutions combine telecom lifecycle management, bill analytics, and mobile identity management. In a nutshell, they help secure and protect mobile workforces and enterprise IT environments. WidePoint is highly speculative given its minuscule $19 million market cap. Shares doubled from November 2023 through January 2024 but have slid since then. However, the valuation still looks cheap to me, so I wouldn’t be surprised to see the stock quickly reverse course and head higher again. The main thing WidePoint has going for it is a customer base that includes the U.S. government. From my experience, once you’re in with the feds, that recurring revenue tends to be very sticky. However, with such a small company, be prepared for some violent stock swings in both directions. This is not a stock for the faint of heart, but more speculative investors may find the risk/reward intriguing. CuriosityStream (NASDAQ:CURI) is a subscription video streaming service specializing in documentaries and other factual content like science, history, and nature programming. I view it as a differentiated player in the crowded streaming wars. As digital media consumption continues rising, I believe CuriosityStream is well-positioned to benefit from its unique content catalog sourced from some top documentary creators.  Many of these content creators have huge followings on platforms like YouTube but also produce exclusive material for CuriosityStream. As the company’s content library expands, I expect its brand equity and subscriber base to grow in tandem. CuriosityStream is still unprofitable, but that may change in the not-so-distant future. Consensus estimates show CuriosityStream’s net losses narrowing over the next few years before reaching breakeven in 2026 with EPS of 5 cents. At the same time, revenue growth is expected to accelerate to nearly 15% that year. Rising revenues combined with drastically improving margins suggest profitability is on the horizon. If CuriosityStream can scale its subscriber base and content portfolio while keeping costs contained, it could be one of the top gainers among penny tech stocks. Rimini Street (NASDAQ:RMNI) provides third-party support for mission-critical enterprise software platforms like Oracle and SAP. They help organizations run, manage, and maintain these systems even after official vendor support ends. Rimini’s services save clients money and ensure smooth operations of their IT infrastructure. RMNI’s chart looks quite ugly when you zoom out over just the past year. Recent performance hasn’t been stellar either. However, I believe shares can stage a significant recovery from current levels as the company’s financials improve. Moreover, the stock trades at a dirt cheap 6 times forward earnings. You’d be hard-pressed to find many other profitable companies with a big growth runway trading this cheaply. The earnings estimates for Rimini Street suggest a period of steady growth and profitability improvement ahead. EPS is forecasted to increase from 45 cents in 2024 to 58 cents in 2025, up 30% year-over-year (YOY). Revenues are also projected to reach $471 million in 2025 from $436 million in 2024.  Another thing I like about Rimini is the stock has seen negligible dilution thanks to profits picking up after a temporary downturn in 2022. Management isn’t relying on endless share issuances to fund the business. This should provide a nice tailwind in the years ahead. Xunlei Limited (NASDAQ:XNET) operates an internet platform in China, leveraging cloud technology. The company focuses on shared cloud computing and blockchain technology to provide solutions for digital content. XNET stock has been trading sideways for the past two years. But I believe a breakout could happen soon as the company’s financials continue growing significantly and it focuses more on higher-margin cloud-based services. One thing that really stands out to me is Xunlei’s massive cash position of $272 million. That’s nearly triple the company’s entire market cap of just $98 million! Xunlei also heavily invests in R&D, which could pay off big time if it can become a tech powerhouse in the future. Regardless of the R&D potential though, I find XNET shares to be extremely undervalued right now. This is a profitable tech company with a huge runway for growth, yet it trades at a measly 7 times trailing earnings. In my view, the stock is a coiled spring ready to deliver multibagger returns going forward. TrueCar (NASDAQ:TRUE) is a digital automotive marketplace aiming to be the most transparent brand in the industry. It empowers car buyers by showing them what others paid for the vehicle they want, helping them recognize a fair price. TrueCar connects these consumers to certified dealers, facilitating a personalized and efficient car buying experience.  Like other automotive stocks, TrueCar hasn’t fared too well recently as rising interest rates caused people to cut back on big-ticket purchases like cars. However, this trend is starting to change as rates stabilize and consumers adjust to the new normal. TRUE stock has been rangebound between $3 to $5 for most of the past five years. But I believe it could soon break out to the upside as the company’s top and bottom lines begin turning around. The earnings estimates for TrueCar indicate a gradual return to profitability over the next several years. While a small loss of 4 cents per share is projected for 2024, earnings are expected to flip to positive in 2025 and grow steadily from there, reaching 35 cents per share in 2029. Revenue growth is also forecasted to be robust, with double-digit increases each year, hitting $317 million by 2029 from $183 million in 2024. The improving fundamentals make it unlikely TRUE shares remain stuck in their current range as the core business rapidly grows. The stars are aligning for this automotive marketplace to shift into a higher gear. Blend Labs (NYSE:BLND) provides a cloud-based software platform for financial services firms in the U.S. It operates two main segments: Blend Platform and Title365. The Blend Builder Platform offers products powering digital-first consumer journeys for mortgages, home equity loans, vehicle loans, and more. The company also provides title search procedures and other professional services. BLND stock has struggled mightily the past few years, down a staggering 85% over the past five. But shares have shown signs of life recently, skyrocketing 254% in the past year alone as Blend’s consumer banking segment picks up steam. I expect the strong performance to continue long-term as well.  As I touched on earlier, elevated interest rates caused many folks to delay borrowing money for major purchases. This weighed on Blend’s business since it meant fewer customers taking out loans. However, the Fed is widely expected to cut rates three times this year. Once that process begins, borrowing activity should pick up considerably, boosting Blend’s top and bottom lines. The company is forecast to turn profitable in 2026, with revenue growth accelerating to around 30% annually. Perhaps more exciting, significant margin expansion could be in the cards as Blend’s automation and AI initiatives start bearing fruit. If management can execute, I wouldn’t be surprised to see the stock deliver triple-digit returns in the coming years.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips George Soros’ hedge fund is making big bets on stocks, though not nearly as big as those he made on global currencies. His biggest investment had been Splunk, a big data analytics firm. He owned 1.6 million shares worth $240 million, representing over 4.5% of the hedge fund’s total portfolio. However, Cisco just acquired the company last month (NASDAQ:CSCO). With an average buy price of around $141 per share, Soros has made a decent profit on the $157 per share acquisition price. What follows are the next three biggest George Soros stocks held in Soros Fund Management according to the latest 13F filing with the SEC. Soros is also gambling on small-cap stocks, which is making a strong comeback. He owns 1.2 million shares of the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSEARCA:IWM), the index that charts the 2,000 smallest stocks in the Russell 3000 index. There’s good reason to believe Soros is on the right track. Historically speaking, small-cap stocks handily outperform mid and large-cap stocks. In their book Investing in Small Cap Stocks, authors Christopher Graja and Elizabeth Ungar found that over the 75 years studied, small-cap stocks beat mid-cap and large-cap stocks 60% of the time. Small-caps have underperformed their larger brethren, but beginning last October, that began to change, and today, the Russell 2000 is edging higher than the S&P 500.  While the small-cap index does hold many tiny companies with market valuations in just the tens of millions of dollars, it also holds some large ones that stretch the definition of “small-cap.” The largest stock in the index is Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI), with a market cap of $55.5 billion. Microstrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) is the next biggest with a $24 billion valuation. As those two stocks have been amongst the market’s top performers over the past year, it’s unsurprising to see the iShares Russell 2000 ETF also doing well. With an $18 billion market valuation, AerCap Holdings (NYSE:AER) isn’t quite a small-cap stock either. But it is having a solid run higher. Shares are up 18% year to date and 57% higher over the last 12 months. The Irish aircraft leasing company capped a strong year with fourth-quarter revenue of $1.9 billion. However, that was just slightly under Wall Street’s forecast for $1.92 billion. Earnings, though, easily trounced projections, coming in at $3.11 per share versus a $2.45 per share consensus view. Soros Fund Management owns almost 2.5 million shares at an average buy-in price of just under $63 per share. That values his stake at $183.5 million, which is good for a 3.5% position in his hedge fund, with the stock trading at around $88 per share, which gives Soros a 40% gain on his holdings so far. Wall Street’s price target aligns with that valuation, but analysts see AerCap rising to $101 per share on the high side. The aircraft leasing company could go higher. CEO Aengus Kelly said, “Given the strong tailwinds that we see for demand for aircraft, engines and helicopters, we are confident about the outlook for AerCap in 2024 and beyond.”  The third stock Soros is making a large bet on is Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL), which holds a 3.2% position in Soros Fund Management. He owns 1.2 million shares worth $170.3 million. The tech giant is not one of his best performers, though. The tech giant’s shares are down 13% from his average buy price of $97. Alphabet has some mixed reviews from hedge fund operators. I noted two weeks ago that Jim Simons at Renaissance Technologies was buying the stock. Still, Paul Tudor Jones from Tudor Investments and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation sold off their respective stakes. It’s hard to bet against Alphabet, though. Google remains a monopoly in search of all but names only, with a 91% market share. Although Alphabet’s advertising revenue disappointed Wall Street earlier this year, it is also an election year. Hundreds of millions of dollars will be dumped into ad campaigns. Google will grab a large portion of those ad dollars. Also, Google Cloud is a fast-growing rival to Amazon‘s (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS and Microsoft‘s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure. It has outpaced both of them for several quarters, with other irons in the fire, including Waymo self-driving vehicles. Alphabet should not be counted out by any means.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk said the company will unveil its robotaxi on Aug. 8. The robotaxi is designed for autonomous driving without pedals or a steering wheel. The announcement sent TSLA stock up 2% over the weekend. It is expected to open this morning at $171 per share, a market capitalization of about $537 billion. Critics are calling the announcement, made on Musk’s X social media platform, a distraction. The company reported lower deliveries in the first quarter and has repeatedly failed to deliver full self-driving (FSD).  Autonomous driving technology has proven difficult to implement since Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) began working on it 15 years ago. The main problem is that the cars can’t deal with the unpredictability of human beings. They also have trouble distinguishing real hazards, like light poles, from fake hazards like traffic cones. Alphabet now offers Waymo automated taxi service in Phoenix and San Francisco, but is trying to expand it to other cities. Tesla has promised self-driving cars since 2016. Last year, the National Transportation Safety Board concluded that Tesla’s technology can be misused. Most worrisome to financial analysts is that Musk seems to be walking away from promises of a $25,000 car that could compete with BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDF) and other Chinese brands. The company teased a “next generation” vehicle at its January earnings call. Analysts have been souring on TSLA stock, with seven of 35 at Tipranks recently calling it a sell and just nine calling it a buy. At Stocktwits, sentiment is called extremely bearish. I have long been bearish on Tesla, which means I missed its rise. But I have maintained that position, especially since the launch of the Cybertruck, which I called a distraction.  Time will tell whether Tesla can deliver on its self-driving promises. Time seems to be what Musk is buying. But sales must pick up for the stock to recover.

      "Analyst Justin Post from Bank of America Securities maintained a Buy rating on Alphabet Class A (GOOGL – Research Report) and keeping the price target at $173.00. Justin Post has given his Buy rating due to a combination of factors that suggest Alphabet Class A’s stock (GOOGL) has potential for growth despite some challenges. While Google’s global search market share has seen a slight decline, Bing and other search engines have only made nominal gains. Moreover, Alphabet’s mobile market share remains dominant. The report also notes that while the emergence of AI-generated content platforms could be perceived as a threat, their web traffic is still minimal compared to Google’s, indicating that the potential impact on Google’s search business is currently not significant. \n",
      "Additionally, Post points to upcoming events and financial indicators that could serve as positive catalysts for Alphabet’s stock. Despite the mixed data in March, the Google Cloud Platform conference, anticipated strong first-quarter search results, and the Google I/O event are expected to provide positive momentum. Furthermore, management’s comments on query growth over the past year have been favorable for investor sentiment. These elements, combined with the company’s solid financial performance and market position, underpin Post’s recommendation to maintain a Buy rating on Alphabet Class A shares.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Semiconductor and AI behemoth Nvidia stock (NASDAQ:NVDA) isn’t even close to being done innovating with its core product and services portfolio. The maker of high-performance chips and AI-related software is seeing record demand, bolstering its top- and bottom-line growth metrics, and delivering whopping returns for investors. The stock more than tripled last year, and is already up roughly 80% this year. That’s the kind of growth compounding most investors would like to see over the course of decades in a given position. Indeed, Nvidia has provided that kind of growth – the kind where one decade’s worth of innovation and growth can happen in a given year. The artificial intelligence boom is for real, and Nvidia stock remains the way to play this trend. Here’s why I think this company could be worth paying up for, particularly on dips moving forward. Nvidia recently introduced the Blackwell platform at its GTC conference, revolutionizing computing with real-time generative AI at a fraction of the cost and energy usage. Featuring six cutting-edge technologies, Blackwell unlocks advancements in various industries, from data processing to quantum computing. CEO Jensen Huang sees Blackwell as pivotal for AI’s widespread adoption, with major companies like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) expected to embrace it.  Blackwell introduces six groundbreaking technologies, facilitating AI training and real-time inference for models with up to 10 trillion parameters. It boasts the world’s most powerful chip, with 208 billion transistors and a custom-built 4NP TSMC process, connecting GPU dies via 10 TB/second chip-to-chip links. The Second-Generation Transformer Engine doubles compute and model sizes, supporting 4-bit floating point AI inference. Additionally, the company’s Fifth-Generation NVLink offers 1.8TB/s bidirectional throughput per GPU for seamless communication among up to 576 GPUs. Blackwell’s RAS Engine ensures reliability, availability, and serviceability, while Secure AI safeguards models and data with advanced confidential computing capabilities. Lastly, a dedicated decompression engine accelerates data analytics and science, enhancing performance in GPU-accelerated data processing. Before the conference, Truist analyst William Stein boosted Nvidia’s price target from $911 to $1,177, anticipating heightened chip demand in 2024 and 2025. Additionally, HSBC analysts upped their price target from $880 to $1,050, maintaining a buy rating. Bank of America analysts revised their price target to $1,100 from $925. Post-conference, UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri upgraded Nvidia’s target price to $1,100 from $800, affirming a buy rating. Arcuri suggested that with Blackwell’s launch, Nvidia could tap into new global enterprise and sovereign demand.  Nvidia’s data center revenue reached $47.5 billion in 2024, with expectations to even reach a bigger number in the years to come. Analysts also anticipate to see the company hit a $300 billion revenue three years from now. With the upcoming B200 Blackwell chip promising enhanced capabilities at competitive pricing, Wall Street firms have raised Nvidia’s price targets accordingly. Nvidia stock unveiled plans for new AI GPUs based on its cutting-edge Blackwell architecture in 2024. These chips promise substantial performance boosts with lower power consumption. Nvidia anticipates widespread adoption by cloud computing providers and aims to expand its presence in the $250 billion GPU market. If Nvidia achieves a discounted 50-times earnings multiple, and reaches $25 per share in earnings, its stock price could surge to $1,250, marking a 33% jump from present levels. This projection surpasses the Street’s highest price target. Moreover, Nvidia might see even more significant gains if the market values it with a higher earnings multiple due to its exceptional growth.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Growth stocks rocketed in the first quarter as markets priced in Federal Reserve rate cuts. Indeed, based on history, the best growth stocks to buy in April will benefit if the Fed cuts rates. According to Schroders, stocks have had an average return of 11% since 1928, twelve months after the Fed began rate cuts. And, if we are just in the early innings of a bull market, growth stocks could have several years of appreciation. Further, the bull case is even stronger based on economic data. First, the unemployment rate is at 3.8%. Secondly, real wage growth has been positive over recent months, which will buoy consumer spending. Thirdly, leading economic indicators have bottomed out and U.S. manufacturing is rebounding. So, this economic and monetary policy backdrop bodes well for these best growth stocks to buy in April. According to Finviz, the following stocks will grow earnings by 30% annually for the next five years. Therefore, expect these stocks to rally further as they outperform expectations going forward.  Shake Shack (NYSE:SHAK) has been rallying on good news. First, in February, it reported impressive fourth quarter results that beat expectations. Total revenue was $286.2 million, growing 20% year over year (YOY). Shake Shack sales were up 2.8%, and it opened 41 new restaurants. Another reason for the rally was the recent appointment of Rob Lynch as CEO. He has led Papa John’s International (NASDAQ:PZZA) since 2019 and brings in a wealth of experience. His marketing and operational expertise will be valuable in the next phase of Shake Shack’s expansion. Also, the restaurant has made significant improvements in profitability. In 2023, restaurant-level operating margins improved by 240 basis points to 19.9%. Management expects more improvements through order customization, tradeups, enhanced labor deployments and supply chain optimization. Furthermore, management expects more growth in 2024 through more Shake Shack openings. They estimate 40 licensed openings and 40 domestic company-operated openings. Given these growth catalysts, analysts are bullish. TD Cowen sees upside to $125 driven by margin improvements, minimal leverage and a new CEO. Thus, Shake Shack has a long-term growth runway as it opens more restaurants. With increasing scale, profit margins will expand going forward.  Fintechs are disrupting traditional finance and winning in the process. DLocal (NASDAQ:DLO) is an upcoming player that is seeing tremendous success. It supports merchants globally in making and receiving payments efficiently and safely. Given its growth trajectory, DLocal is one of the best growth stocks to buy in April. Over the past five years, it has grown total payment volume (TPV) 14-fold to over $17.7 billion. Today, major companies like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) are customers. In 2023, its platform served over 600 merchants in 40 countries. TPV was up 67% YOY and revenue was $650 million, representing 55% growth. It is worth noting that most of the growth was from existing merchants as DLocal gained wallet share. Indeed, customers trust the company as exhibited by net revenue retention of 150%. Also, management has focused on profitable growth, achieving some of the best metrics among peers. 2023 gross profit grew 37% YOY to $277 million and adjusted EBITDA was $202 million, up 32% YOY. Looking ahead, DLocal’s prospects are very exciting. Management expects a record total payment volume in 2024, with 40% to 50% growth. They also forecast adjusted EBITDA between US$220 and US$260M, maintaining the focus on profitable growth. DLO stock is a profitable growth story that will roar higher.  Nextracker (NASDAQ:NXT) is a unique way to invest in solar growth without much risk. Unlike solar panels that are heavily commoditized, Nextracker provides proprietary software and controls for large-scale solar projects. Its solar tracker solutions align solar panels with sunlight, enhancing power production. On that note, Nextracker is in the midst of a long-term secular growth trend. As utilities retire legacy power generation assets such as coal, renewable sources like solar will fill that gap. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, U.S. solar power generation will grow from 163 billion kilowatt hours (kWh) in 2023 to 286 billion kWh next year, representing 75% growth. Thus, customer demand will grow, benefiting Nextracker. According to Mordor Intelligence, the tracker market will expand at a 22.38% compounded annual growth rate between 2024 and 2029. Nextracker is the global leader with over 500 patents and its products have been shipped to over 30 countries. Due to robust demand, revenue growth accelerated in every quarter last year.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Quantum computing will bring about the next computing revolution that will overshadow the prescient artificial intelligence (AI) craze. There are certain kinds of problems that are effectively impossible or inefficient for conventional, classical computers to solve, but not for quantum computers. This has led many investors to seek out the best quantum computing stocks to buy. Novel quantum computers can be a gamechanger in terms of current cryptography methods and could also allow for the introduction of completely private communication. Complex problems in optimization, machine learning and simulation will also become solvable with quantum computing. Investors who are already looking for the next market sensation are considering a few names in the nascent quantum computing space. Wall Street has caught wind of some of the quantum computing names that could make successful plays in the long term. Below are three such quantum computing stocks. International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM), one of the most established companies in the tech industry, has been working on quantum computers since the early 2000s. For example, in 2001, IBM researchers had already been performing quantum computing techniques to solve cryptography problems. IBM’s quantum computer consists of superconducting qubits that operate at near-zero temperatures. The tech giant also offers a cloud-based quantum computing service called IBM Quantum Experience, which allows customers and researchers to access its quantum hardware and software through the cloud rather than spending a lot of cash to buy a physical quantum computer.  In recent years, IBM has endured single-digit revenue growth, including in 2023, but the tech giant has continued to beat estimates in their recent Q4’2023 earnings report. Both revenue and earnings figures came above what Wall Street analysts had projected; IBM also found itself flush with more free cash flow than it had anticipated. More breakthroughs in quantum computing could spur revenue growth in the future. IBM expects to it won’t have a practical quantum computer until the end of the decade, which makes IBM a compelling long-term hold. IonQ (NYSE:IONQ) happens to be the first pure-play among publicly traded quantum computing stocks and it will be the only pure-play quantum computing player to make this list. The company is a leader in trapped-ion quantum computing, which uses electrically charged atoms to store and manipulate qubits. To date, the company claims to have built the world’s most powerful quantum computer which has achieved a quantum capacity 32 qubits. IonQ plans to launch modular quantum computers by the end of 2023. To make the computing power of its quantum computers more accessible, IonQ has made its quantum computing power accessible to customers and developers through large cloud platforms. IonQ ended 2023 with another successful quarter. Fourth-quarter earnings results saw the quantum computing firm generate full-year revenue figures well above the high end of its guidance range. This was the same for bookings. IonQ also announced the production of its Enterprise Forte quantum computer in its Seattle manufacturing facility. Deliveries for these quantum systems are slated for the end of 2024. IonQ’s shares are down almost 25% on a year-to-date basis, which could make a good entry point for new investors or investors willing to increase their investment. Quantum computing, similar to generative AI, has the potential to be the next big thing in technology, and IonQ is at the forefront of the space. You can see why this made our list of the best quantum computing stocks to buy.  Flush with cash, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL) has made a variety of investments in various computing technologies over the past two decades. The company also has been developing quantum computers since 2006 and achieved a milestone in 2019 when it demonstrated “quantum supremacy,” or the ability of a quantum computer to perform a task that is impossible for a classical computer. Google’s quantum computer, called Sycamore, used 54 qubits to perform a calculation in 200 seconds that would take a supercomputer much longer to complete. Although some researchers have claimed to be able to do what Google’s Sycamore had done by using a normal supercomputer, Google is continuously working on improving its quantum hardware, software and algorithms. And the results are promising. The new version of Sycamore apparently can make calculations that would take supercomputers 47 years to complete. In order to bring about more use-cases for quantum computing, Google has launched a 3-year competition with a $5 million prize for researchers who can come up with new quantum algorithms that can solve existing problems humanity faces. This kind of investment could definitely help steer the new sector in the right direction. In its Q4’2023 earnings report, cloud continued to be the company’s growth engine, growing 26% on a year over year (YOY). In the long term, quantum computing could be an even bigger growth engine for Google. If you are looking for the best quantum computing stocks to buy, start here.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips The Magnificent Seven stocks make up a large portion of the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100. The performances of these seven stocks can potentially make or break the stock market. While the Magnificent Seven is a relatively new name, the group is quite familiar. Investors may remember hearing about FANG and FAANG stocks for several years. Most of the stocks that made up FAANG are members of the Magnificent Seven. Corporations change over time and impact long-term investors. Some businesses that once achieved impressive growth rates aren’t living up to the Magnificent Seven stock club. However, these three giants are still delivering solid returns for investors, and it looks like they have more room to climb. Here are the best Magnificent 7 stocks to buy in April. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is becoming the largest artificial intelligence (AI) stock, in addition to Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). While Nvidia produces the chips, Microsoft has made acquisitions and investments left and right. The company is even making moves that resemble acquisitions to avoid regulators.  Microsoft isn’t only expanding through AI. The company also acquired Activision to strengthen its video game segment, which features Xbox. Gaming has been a benefactor for Microsoft, but the company makes most of its money from cloud computing. Microsoft Cloud revenue grew by 24% year-over-year (YoY)  in Q2 FY24. The segment generated $33.7 billion of the company’s $62.0 billion in revenue for the quarter. Microsoft’s overall business delivered an 18% YoY increase in revenue. Net income jumped by 33% YoY, bringing profit margins to 35.3% in the process. Microsoft is the largest publicly traded corporation and has exceptional long-term returns. The stock is up 245% over the past five years and has already gained 12% year-to-date. Nvidia has been another top-performing stock that looks like it can extend its rally. The company’s GPU chips continue to gain market share and have given the company a comfortable lead over its competitors. It’s hard to recall a time when a mega-cap corporation exhibited the same financial growth that Nvidia currently enjoys. The AI giant reported 265% YoY revenue growth and 769% YoY net income growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024.  AI spending will eventually slow down, but Nvidia is still likely to grow at a respectable rate in the years ahead. Investors shouldn’t expect triple-digit growth rates to last much longer. The stock currently trades at a 36-forward P/E ratio and is up 74% year-to-date. Profit margins have expanded dramatically since the AI boom. The company reported a 55.6% net profit margin to close out the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. Revenue and earnings growth rates from that quarter have outpaced the stock’s gains over the past year. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) has built the world’s largest online advertising network. Many people instinctively use Google to find information online. I certainly use Google when doing research for articles like this one. Some visitors click advertisements that display relevant information, and Alphabet has gotten very good at showing relevant advertisements for search queries. Once businesses use Google or YouTube Ads effectively, it’s difficult to leave. Shutting off an ad campaign means walking away from the steady leads and sales that those ads generate. Alphabet continued to grow its advertising segment in the fourth quarter of 2023. During that quarter, revenue increased by 13% YoY. While ads are the big storyline, Google Cloud has been gaining more market share in the cloud computing industry. That segment is also expanding its profit margins, which helped Alphabet report a 52% YoY improvement in net income.  The company’s stock is up by 152% over the past five years and 9% year-to-date.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips 2024 is shaping up to be a tumultuous year for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). The tech behemoth and smartphone market leaders had been forced to contend with stock price downgrades from banks following lower consumer demand, and now face a landmark lawsuit amid accusations of building an industry monopoly. Apple has firmly denied the allegations, but this has failed to stop comparisons being drawn between the firm and Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) behavior in the 1990s, which resulted in a lawsuit and requirements that the company modify its more monopolistic practices. On Wall Street, there’s already been some damage done to Apple’s stock price. The first quarter of 2024 saw AAPL tumble more than 8%, and the prospect of a costly reprimand could bring a fundamental change in the way that Apple operates which opens the door to stronger smartphone market competition. While the outcome of the lawsuit could hit Apple’s pockets, fundamental shifts in business operations could carry major ramifications for its market dominance. Should Apple be forced to make products more interoperable with other brands and provide more open services, consumers may be free to mix and match brands on an unprecedented scale. This may open the door to the following key smartphone stocks to grow into Apple’s market share:  Unlike Apple, Google parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL,NASDAQ:GOOG) has gotten off to a strong start in 2024, posting growth of around 10% in the first quarter. Back in Q4 2023, Alphabet reported its fastest quarter for revenue growth since early 2022, with sales accelerating 13% from $76.05 billion year-over-year. Despite this impressive expectation-beating performance, share prices briefly slipped due to weaker Google ad revenue. Recently, Alphabet’s stock rallied after reports suggested Google may be readying to put its artificial intelligence (AI) search services behind a paywall. Crucially, AI has been an area where Google has been quick to adopt while Apple’s interest in the emerging technology remained more hesitant. Not only could this offer a crucial fresh revenue stream for Alphabet, but it could also see AI services become a key feature of Google’s next generation of Pixel smartphones, which are readying for launch later this year. With Android as the closest rival of Apple’s iOS smartphone operating system, any challenges to the latter’s attempted smartphone industry monopoly will see Google’s market position improve. Additionally, should Apple be ordered to create cross-functionality throughout its range of smartphone products, we could see a surge in demand for Android products among iPhone users.  Another stock that outperformed Apple in Q1 2024 and could benefit from a de-monopolization of the smartphone market is South Korean firm Samsung Electronics (OTCMKTS:SSNLF). While Samsung experienced slow growth throughout the opening weeks of the year, the recent news that the tech giant could be in line to become a supplier to semiconductor leaders Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) saw a rapid 5% jump in stock value. Currently, Nvidia is testing Samsung’s new range of high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips in what may be a lucrative partnership. Samsung’s advantageous position in the global chip market recovery has seen the firm’s stock price grow of late, and many securities firms are forecasting an operating profit of over 5 trillion won ($3.7 billion) in Q1 2024, up significantly from the 640 billion won ($476 million) recorded one year prior. If these figures are achieved, they would represent Samsung’s largest operating profit since the third quarter of 2022. Samsung’s position in the smartphone market may be another cause for investor optimism in the wake of Apple’s ongoing difficulties. The firm recently revealed the Galaxy ring in January at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. With the Galaxy ring, Samsung is set to enter the smart wearables market while innovating beyond traditional smartphones.  Although it can be difficult to monitor the long-term consumer appetite for smart wearables, the fallout of Apple’s lawsuit could see the Galaxy ring win a new audience among iPhone users. Yes, Nokia ADR (NYSE:NOK) may be trading at just 5% of its market peak during the Finnish firm’s heyday at the turn of the century, but there’s still plenty for investors to be optimistic about for a stock that’s continued to defy expectations in recent years. In Q1 2024, NOKIA grew a healthy 4%, and the stock has recently earned the attention of meme investors who have sought to buy into Nokia through a sense of nostalgia and high retail investor sentiment. Despite the company’s enduring popularity, times have been tough of late for Nokia. Q4 2023 sales of 5.7 billion euros represent a 23% year-over-year decline, while operating profit dropped 27% year-on-year to 846 million euros. Nokia’s recent hardships have prompted a 600 million euro share buyback scheme in early 2024, and telecommunications operator cutbacks and a slowdown among investments in India have caused the company to forecast more difficulty over the year ahead.  These forecasts make Nokia a riskier opportunity for investors, but it’s important to note that the firm’s slowing sales have already been factored into the market, and it’s also worth highlighting that Nokia is continuing to win new admirers amid growing ‘dumb’ phone market sentiment. While it’s been hard for Nokia to compete with Android and iOS market leaders, the firm’s power of nostalgia is seeing more users opt for the app-free offerings of Nokia’s streamlined handsets. While the lure of Nokia’s meme stock status and ‘dumb’ phone popularity could help the company to outperform its expectations in 2024, it may depend on the firm’s relationship with HMD, which has long-manufactured phones for Nokia but may soon begin using its own branding. Either way, Nokia remains a stock that’s worth tracking as an unpredictable 2024 could deliver plenty of market twists and turns.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL) stock has endured its fair share of challenges in recent times. Amid the tech sector, layoffs in 2022 and higher interest rates affecting bottom line growth. However, as we look toward 2024, the advent of AI makes the stock a compelling investment opportunity. Their parent company, Google, is making significant advancements in generative AI set to revolutionize search. Their recent quarterly earnings show positive signs of a rebound in the advertising market. This is crucial to Alphabet’s bottom line, and their new Gemini Ultra LLM will be groundbreaking as they work to gain a competitive edge. Alphabet’s financial health is closely tied to the advertising market, with Google Search and YouTube being the key revenue drivers. Despite a rough patch in 2023, recent quarterly earnings point to a resurgence in ad revenue. In Q4 2023, there were clear signs of recovery, specifically growth driven by the retail sector in the Asia-Pacific region. YouTube ad revenue increased 15% YOY to $9.2 billion, with Google Search and Cloud driving double digit growth.  The broader economy is stabilizing as CEO anticipate rate cuts from the Federal Reserve in the back half of 2024. Alphabet’s core business is likely to benefit significantly. This combined with the potential of new advertising channels driven by generative AI integrations, paints a positive picture for revenue growth in 2024 and beyond. Alphabet is currently at the forefront of artificial intelligence and deep learning research. Discoveries and advancements in LLMs, like Google’s Gemini Ultra model, offer transformative potential across various industries and domains. Gemini Ultra boasts superior multimodal capabilities in language understanding, knowledge retrieval, and generation could lead to improved business processes. It is well equipped to train diverse data sets, while maintaining the most up-to-date information in order to reduce biases. The model leverages the latest advancements in natural language processing to accelerate vocabulary acquisition, grammar comprehension and speed. Gemini 1.5 is their next-generation model with breakthroughs in long-context understanding. This advanced model outperforms its competitor, ChatGPT, on nearly every benchmark from general, reasoning, math, and code generation. Alphabet stock presents a strong investment case for investors looking to capitalize on the AI boom. The company’s potential to leverage generative AI in its search engine and advance their LLM could help them gain a competitive edge in the marketplace.  The stock market is setting up for volatility ahead, and Alphabet may experience some turbulence in the short term. That will provide investors with ample opportunities to buy the dip before the next rip to $200.00 per share and beyond.

      "HubSpot Inc (NYSE:HUBS) shares are trading higher on continued upward momentum following a report suggesting Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is in talks with advisors about a potential offer for the company. Piper Sandler analyst Brent Bracelin maintained HubSpot shares as Overweight with a $675 price target. Bracelin has long noted that IaaS could be natural consolidators of a highly fragmented SaaS landscape. The transition from traditional client-server applications to cloud computing models over the past 20+ years has created a proliferation of SaaS applications that today include 100+ publics and 1,000+ privates, Bracelin said. Private equity firms such as Thoma Bravo and Vista Equity Partners have been the most prolific consolidators of the SaaS ecosystem over the past three to five years. The analyst flagged Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Oracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL) as the only two cloud platforms operating over $10 billion IaaS platforms alongside over $10 billion SaaS application suites.  Bracelin argued that Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet could move higher up the stack into SaaS applications. HubSpot was a SaaS pioneer that has expanded revenue to plus $2 billion since it was founded in 2006, he said. The analyst believed the combination of Google Workspace and the HubSpot Customer Platform makes strategic sense. HubSpot has 205K paid customers, with an average size of 25 employees per customer, while Google Workspace has 9 million paid customers. Bracelin said the potential cross-sell of HubSpot SaaS applications into a large Google Workspace installed base could be compelling. According to Gartner, HubSpot has captured a small slice of the $22 billion CRM marketing software industry with just a 4.9% market share in 2022. The two most prominent platforms in CRM marketing include Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) (15% share) and Adobe Inc (NASDAQ:ADBE) (15% share). Canaccord Genuity analyst Richard Davis maintained HubSpot with a Buy and raised the price target from $700 to $750.  HubSpot stock gained 67% in the past 12 months. Investors can gain exposure to the stock via Sterling Capital Focus Equity ETF (NYSE:LCG) and Spear Alpha ETF (NASDAQ:SPRX).

      "Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) saw its shares surge to a new all-time high of $530 per share on Thursday. This upward movement was driven by positive sentiment following Jefferies’ reiteration of a Buy rating and an increase in the price target from $550 to $585. Over the recent past, Meta Platforms’ stock performance has been impressive, with shares recording a 137.95% increase over the past year and a 44.34% gain year-to-date. Related: What’s Going On With Facebook Parent Meta Platforms’ Stock? Despite hitting an all-time high, Meta’s stock maintains a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 25.57, positioning it among of the lowest ratios among its Magnificent Seven peers. Notably, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) dba Google‘s P/E ratio stands at 22.37, while the rest are above Meta’s valuation. Moreover, recent analyst ratings from Jefferies, Wells Fargo, and Roth MKM on April 4, April 3, and March 18, suggest an average price target of $561.67 for Meta stock, indicating a potential upside of 9.30% from current price levels.  From a technical standpoint, Meta stock exhibits a strongly bullish trend. The stock is trading above its 5, 20, and 50-day exponential moving averages, signaling positive momentum. Additionally, Meta stock’s moving averages and other technical indicators such as Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) and Bollinger Bands suggest a bullish sentiment. However, Meta Platforms’ Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 63.22 indicates that it’s nearing overbought conditions, which investors should consider. Despite this, the overall bullish momentum and positive analyst sentiment position Meta as a potentially attractive investment opportunity amid the company’s continuous innovation and growth in the digital landscape.

      "Wedbush's Dan Ives thinks that a culmination of the AI revolution and improving ad spending will make the March quarter \"one to watch\" for companies in the technology sector. What Happened: Ives expressed optimism about the prospects of big technology companies in the March 2024 quarter. \"I think it's going to be one for the ages in terms of digital advertising,\" Ives explained, underscoring that Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google is his top pick for this reason. Ives thinks that the spending environment in the tech industry is improving. This will help us see the next part of the \"AI revolution,\" according to Ives. \"Big Tech earnings should be robust for 1Q and an important moment to put fuel into this tech rally with earnings/growth moving higher,\" Ives said in an interview with CNBC.  Subscribe to the Benzinga Tech Trends newsletter to get all the latest tech developments delivered to your inbox. Ives has been consistent in his belief that the next phase of the AI revolution is the demand of AI and cloud computing. After Oracle Corp.'s (NYSE:ORCL) fiscal third-quarter earnings, Ives underscored that its \"hypergrowth\" in AI is the \"big clue\" of the AI revolution puzzle. Now, based on Wedbush's surveys, Ives thinks that the growth here is \"much stronger than expected\" when it comes to advertising, which will help boost Google's revenues.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Augmented reality (AR), still in its early stages, is set to grow rapidly as recent innovations bring new products to market and ultimately reduce costs. Estimating the market value of augmented reality is challenging, yet conservative predictions suggest it could reach up to $58 billion by 2028, with $38 billion in sales expected this year alone. That growth makes AR stocks a hot opportunity to capitalize on long-term tech trends still in their relative infancy. With the emergence of any new technology, a flood of new companies, startups and innovators are entering the market, seeking investor attention. But not all will succeed. For those interested in strong buy AR stocks, sticking with well-known, reputable companies is the safest bet today. Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), a leading augmented reality manufacturer, is unlikely to allow new market entrants or current competitors to usurp its position. Its collaborative effort with Samsung and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) reinforces its dominance in hardware and signals a promising future as the augmented reality markets evolve. The partnership plans to develop a comprehensive mixed-reality platform, capitalizing on Qualcomm’s technological expertise, Samsung’s hardware prowess and Google’s investments in augmented reality tools. While we’re waiting for a definitive product announcement, industry analysts predict the collaboration will result in a series of headsets offering novel virtual reality experiences, which could significantly boost Qualcomm’s revenue.  In addition, Qualcomm is continuously upgrading its broad virtual reality product array, including headsets. Equipped with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon processor, these products feature the most advanced WiFi technology and eye-tracking capabilities, driving forward innovation in the augmented reality domain and setting new benchmarks for the industry. Though a ways off from its past $3 trillion market cap, Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) ventures into augmented reality remain a top prospect for investors looking for strong buy AR stocks. The company has impressively sold as many as 200,000 Vision Pro headsets already, despite its hefty $3,499 price tag. Sales are expected to increase as the product’s capabilities become evident to early adopters, and the cost of units eventually declines. A potential issue on the horizon is the possibility of the Vision Pro cannibalizing sales from other Apple products, particularly tablets and iPads, which are already experiencing a sales decline. Apple finds itself at a pivotal moment, anticipating the stabilization of Vision Pro sales and determining whether this new hardware and augmented reality technology will be a temporary trend or replicate the groundbreaking impact of the iPod in the mid-2000s. Regardless, Apple currently stands as the leading augmented reality stock, making it an excellent choice for investors seeking a blue-chip entry into the burgeoning market. Meta (NASDAQ:META) closely trails Apple but might soon overtake it as a leader in the augmented reality (AR) market. A major consumer review has placed Apple’s Vision Pro and Meta’s Quest Pro on equal footing, rating them both at four stars. However, Quest Pro’s much lower price point positions the product not merely as a cheaper alternative to Apple’s but as a cost-effective innovator independent of the brand-name weight Apple carries. That distinction makes Meta a compelling AR stock option. Beyond the Quest Pro, Mark Zuckerberg and his team are reportedly working on projects that could significantly impact their AR efforts. In mid-January, Zuckerberg announced significant investments in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) chips. The move supports Meta’s AI development and suggests a major commitment to building a “massive compute infrastructure” likely to enhance AR platforms, particularly with AI integration.  Matching Apple in the realm of blue-chip AR stocks, Meta represents a reliable investment to tap into emerging trends within the developing AR sector.

      "(RTTNews) - Alphabet, Inc.'s (GOOG) Google is reportedly planning to start charging for AI-enhanced search features, in order to cover expenses incurred in providing the service. According to a report by the Financial Times, Google proposes to offer new search features to its premium subscribers, who will be able to converse with the company's generative AI in a way similar to OpenAI's ChatGPT. The alleged proposal marks the first time the tech giant has charged for any of its core products, most of which are available for free and funded by Google's advertising revenue. The company reported revenue of $175 billion from search and related ads last year, but the launch of ChatGPT has posed a threat to Google by providing quick answers to users instead of a traditional search engine's list of answers. Google started developing the \"Search Generative Experience\" including a feature called \"AI-powered snapshot\" in May last year, to present detailed responses to user's queries along with additional links and advertisements.  Responding to the report, the California-based company said that it was \"not working or considering\" an ad-free search experience but it would continue to \"build new premium capabilities and services to enhance subscription offerings across Google\". It maintained, \"We don't have anything to announce right now.\"\n",
      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips While Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock continues to grab headlines for being the single-biggest loser so far in 2024, there’s one major investor who thinks the electric vehicle (EV) maker is due for a recovery: Cathy Wood. The Ark Invest manager believes that Tesla’s more than 30% drawdown is just a road bump before CEO Elon Musk’s brainchild soars to new highs. How high you might ask? Wood has a $2,000 price target on TSLA stock. For context, the stock currently trades for $171 per share. Wood recently discussed her optimism for Tesla, arguing that the company is still positioned strongly for the all-electric future. “Now is not the time to run for the hills,” Wood said in an interview with CNBC.  Ark Invest recently bought up millions of dollars worth of Tesla ahead of the company’s first-quarter earnings call last week. Unfortunately, the company’s financial results were nothing short of disappointing, further digging Tesla into the red. Still, Wood believes that Tesla’s future is bright. The fund manager thinks that Tesla will hit its stride when it eventually rolls out its robotaxi business, which she estimates could contribute to $10 trillion in revenue by 2030. Wood is a long-time Tesla fan, having once maintained a price target of $5,000 per share for TSLA stock. Despite Wood’s faith, much of Wall Street has abandoned Tesla. Indeed, the EV maker has already shed more than $240 billion in value in 2024, with some analysts even claiming that the “Magnificent Seven” is now the “Fab Four,” cutting Tesla, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) from the roster. Not for nothing, Tesla has largely failed to meet expectations this year. In its recently posted Q1 financial results, the company announced a year-over-year (YOY) decline in global vehicle deliveries — for the first time since 2020.  The company has seen a sharp pullback in EV demand, attributable to a number of possible headwinds, including increased competition in China. “[It] was a messy first quarter,” noted Guggenheim Securities analyst Ronald Jewsikow. “The demand is slowing, China competition is strong, and then Europe hasn’t grown for five quarters now for Tesla. Structurally, there’s emerging risks in all three regions that, even as we move beyond a very messy first quarter earnings result, there’s reasons for concern.” Whether this once-upon-a-time EV darling reclaims its seat among new tech giants, remains to be seen.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Ken Fisher of Fisher Asset Management comes from investing royalty. His father, Philip Fisher, wrote the investment classic “Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits” and whom Morningstar called “one of the great investors of all time.” He was a long-term, buy-and-hold investor who, like Warren Buffett, believed the best time to sell a stock was “almost never.” Many of those attributes were passed down to his son, who manages $265 billion in assets under management (AUM). Despite its size, Fisher Asset Management has notched some impressive gains over the past decade. The firm’s 10-year annual returns are north of 58%, while over the last five years, Fisher returned 63%. In just the last 12 months he is up to 24%. Although he has a large portfolio containing well over 900 companies, these are the three stocks dominating this investing icon’s portfolio today. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) recently slipped to fifth place as the most valuable company in Fisher’s portfolio, but its performance so far this year has been stellar. AMZN stock is up 20% year to date and more than 76% higher over the past year.  Because the online retailer is so integral to the economy, it was added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average. It’s not just because of its e-commerce platform but also its cloud services business, which provides the backbone for the internet presence of numerous companies. And it continues to improve itself. Cost-cutting measures and integration of artificial intelligence (AI) are paying benefits to Amazon. Strong revenue and better profit margins over the past few quarters are just some of the tangible results of its efforts. Perhaps most notable is the surge in advertising revenue, up 27% last quarter to $14.7 billion. It is already the third-largest ad platform behind Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). Fisher owns 41.8 million shares of Amazon stock worth $7.6 billion, making it the fourth-largest position in his portfolio at 3.7% of the total. With an average purchase price of around $54 per share, Fisher has seen his investment more than triple in value. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the biggest position Fisher owns. It represents 5% of his portfolio. Few stocks are as closely associated with AI as Microsoft. Having integrated OpenAI’s ChatGPT generative AI technology into all aspects of its operations, the tech giant is receiving significant dividends. AI contributed 600 basis points of growth to Microsoft’s Azure cloud services business last quarter, double what it had done just one quarter prior. It is also helping Microsoft land more and bigger deals for longer contractual periods of time.  Clients like Azure. It allows them to grow their transition to the cloud at their own pace. The hybrid environment lets them choose the level of service they want and where they want it. They can choose between on-premises, in the cloud or a combination of both. Expect to see AI’s growth rate and contribution to Microsoft accelerate in the coming quarters. Fisher owns 25.4 million shares of MSFT stock worth $10.7 billion. He’s generated gains of 291% so far with his average purchase price of $107 per share. The No. two holding in Fisher Asset Management is Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Despite all the headwinds the consumer electronics stock faces, Apple has tripled Fisher’s investment from the average buy-in price of $51 per share. Yet the headwinds are legion. Most notable is the Justice Dept. suing Apple for antitrust violations. Although some of the allegations seem ludicrous, such as operating a monopoly when it has but a 57% share of the domestic smartphone market, it will be a distraction for management as it fights back against the charges. Apple also has its work cut out for it in China, one of its biggest markets but also one that has seen sales slow dramatically. Its iPhone sales reportedly plummeted 33% in China in January and February, according to Bloomberg News. Of course, March tends to be the strongest month of the three in the quarter, so we will need to see how the iPhone fared then.  The consumer tech leader has its next iteration of the smartphone coming out later this year. The iPhone 16 should also have some form of Google’s own AI technology accessible so it could be a big seller. Apple stock is down 9% year-to-date, but no one suggests the party is over by a long shot.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Today, massive short-squeeze opportunities aren’t as common as they once were. The advent of rapid, high-frequency trading and automated management systems lets short sellers closely track a stock’s movement and jump into action before the conditions for a short squeeze fully materialize. Still, certain heavily shorted stocks present the potential for quick gains as short sellers exit their positions. But high short interest isn’t the best indicator on its own — you have to look at the company’s underlying potential and prospects, unlike, say, hoping for another once-in-a-lifetime short squeeze on a poor performer like Gamestop (NYSE:GME) These three stocks have both traits: decent prospects on their own but unusually high short interest considering their true potential. And that formula sets the perfect conditions for a short squeeze. With a 65% short interest, Imperial Petroleum (NASDAQ:IMPP) is the fourth-most shorted stock this week, notable since many analysts find no substantial flaws with the stock. Imperial operates a relatively small fleet of tankers transporting refined oil. Like many stocks in the sector, Imperial presents a decent small-cap value opportunity beyond its strong short-squeeze potential.  Imperial Petroleum’s earnings report on Feb. 13th, detailing the last quarter and the full fiscal year 2023, demonstrates its strength on both counts. Although Q4 showed modest performance, the year’s financials demonstrated a revenue surge of nearly 90% and net income growth of 141% from 2022. Furthermore, leveraging its substantial cash reserves, the company has continued its $10 million share buyback program throughout the quarter. This strategy is particularly significant given Imperial’s status as one of the most shorted stocks and its slow melt upward over the past month. By buying back shares at these lower prices, IMPP’s management effectively capitalizes on the discount. Coupled with the high short interest, this move significantly heightens the potential for a dramatic short squeeze. Bears are still betting iRobot‘s (NASDAQ:IRBT) failed Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) acquisition spells doom for the robotic vacuum maker. Previously a top merger arbitrage play for 2024, iRobot pivoted to its new status as a prime candidate for a short squeeze with a 35% short interest. Beyond its short-squeeze potential, iRobot stands out as a solid value investment, considering its 0.25x price-to-sales ratio. The company’s sales remain solid to boot, especially considering its higher-end product line and current household budget tightening. The company’s fourth-quarter and end-of-year filings also point to successful executive adaptation to changing conditions. The year’s final quarter highlights include a narrower net loss per share ($2.28) compared to a $3.07 loss during the same period in 2022. That comes, in part, from the rapid right-sizing post-merger collapse that includes an “operational restructuring plan [to] stabilize the business” with plans to “simplify [their] cost structure, create a more sustainable business model, and [focus on] core value drivers.” Ultimately, iRobot is more than a vacuum maker. The company’s range of automation and robotics patents are a major reason Amazon angled for the buyout in the first place. Even if the company can’t set new financial records, it can always fall back on that figurative goldmine.  Desktop Metal (NYSE:DM), a penny stock in the 3D-printing sector, faces substantial short interest (currently sitting around 33%). But the company has a handful of bullish tailwinds gathering behind it that could rapidly trigger an uncontrollable short squeeze, considering its low per-share pricing. First, with shares sitting consistently below $1, there’s little gain to be had from continuing to hold a short position. The risk/reward balance skews heavily toward the risk side of the equation. Expect any significant upward movement to trigger rapid closure. Secondly, Desktop Metal is right-sizing operations, and its recent quarterly report underscores the point. The company’s most recent filing includes a record $65 million in annual recurring revenue — a 29% increase year-over-year. It also enjoyed a substantial reduction in net losses to $323.3 million from a previous $740.3 million. The company’s potential is further underscored by the strategic backing of heavyweights like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Ford (NYSE:F). It indicates a solid vote of confidence in Desktop Metal’s operational and strategic direction. Beyond that backing, Desktop Metal’s healthcare subsidiary (Desktop Health) just launched ScanUp. It’s a subscription-based initiative to bring dental practices into the 21st century by introducing them to digital workflows. Since “half of the dentists in the U.S. have not yet adopted intraoral scanning,” Desktop Health is penetrating a vast and largely untapped market. The platform, bundled into an initial 36-month commitment, promises to secure steady, predictable revenue streams for Desktop Metal, increasing the odds of a short squeeze.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips The crypto market has been going through a sizable correction recently. However, in my view, this cooldown offers a prudent entry point before the next leg higher. As we’ve seen many times during previous bull markets, Bitcoin (BTC-USD) often corrects 15-20% before powering ahead to new highs in the following weeks. I believe we could see something similar play out in the months ahead. Historically, a Bitcoin halving has been preceded by a price correction as Bitcoin consolidates, and it seems we’re going through that now before the halving’s impact catches up. Once the supply crunch from the halving combines with billions flowing into Bitcoin through spot ETFs, we could see crypto lift off to new heights. In the long-run, this could send the rest of the crypto market soaring, especially when the fabled altseason arrives. With that backdrop in mind, let’s explore three cryptocurrencies to consider buying before the Bitcoin halving and pending interest rate cuts take place. Tatsu (TAT-USD) is an emerging player in the crypto sector that provides an exciting concept. The project merges machine learning with decentralization to enable advanced application development. The crypto has recovered significantly recently after going through a correction in late March.  Tatsu is working on creating a world-class open ecosystem for developers to collectively build and profit from the growth we’re seeing in the machine learning space. Tatsu is also closely tied to Bittensor (TAO-USD), a crypto that’s seen immense buzz of late. Bittensor has spiked from $50 to $580 since October. Tatsu could certainly see similar gains, riding the same tailwinds. Moreover, with Tatsu only recently listing on the Mexc exchange, it seems probable further gains lie ahead once the trading frenzy subsides. These price swings make Tatsu one of the most high-risk, high-reward bets among these three picks. But with the right timing, Tatsu could still generate outsized returns over the long-term, for those with the stomach for this volatility. Tectum’s (TET-USD) proprietary Proof-of-Utility consensus mechanism enables this network to achieve unparalleled transaction speeds exceeding 1 million per second – a quantum leap over older blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH-USD). With the capacity to process exponentially more transactions at a lightning pace, Tectum boasts some of the best utility of any layer-1 blockchain. Thus, it ranks highly among my top layer-1 crypto picks. However, I should note that layer-1 cryptos can only deliver astonishing returns if they demonstrate their utility. Other layer-1 startups like DevvE (DEVVE-USD) have lost 50% of their value from their recent peaks due to dilution and failures to feature key things, such as a testnet.  I believe Tectum can be a big winner once the project’s underlying technology is tried and tested. Whether it ultimately succeeds remains unknown. But Tectum’s upside potential is certainly enormous, if this blockchain gains traction. I previously highlighted EGO (EGO-USD) during its pre-sale, and it has climbed nicely since then. However, this token has recently corrected alongside the broader crypto market. Despite the recent pullback, I continue to see sizable upside potential for EGO, as tailwinds align for this project. EGO is the native token of Paysenger, a collaboration platform bringing together creators, fans, and brands. Paysenger utilizes cutting-edge technology and proprietary AI developed by a former Stanford professor. The platform enables paid requests for exclusive content, tips, and expert opinions. Users can also consume subscription-based paid content. Paysenger expands paid creator audiences by letting users to earn EGO tokens for completing tasks. It streamlines collaborations between “idea creators” and content creators. It also introduces personalized AI models that generate art mimicking a creator’s unique style. Paysenger is basically bridging Web 2.0 and Web 3.0. As a result, it is boosting blockchain adoption by attracting many Web 2.0 users. I believe EGO could be a multi-bagger pick, since it only has a market cap of around $4 million at the time of writing.  However, this project has more than 1 million users and is an alumnus of the Consensys accelerator. Passenger also was recognized as a startup program by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and received more than $200,000 in grants from major infrastructure giants.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips HubSpot (NYSE:HUBS) stock is on the rise Thursday as investors weigh reports that the cloud-based customer relationship management company could be acquired by Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG). According to insider reports, Alphabet is in discussions with advisor Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) about making a potential offer for the company. It’s still unclear how much it would spend to acquire HubSpot. One thing that investors will note is that HubSpot has a market capitalization of roughly $32 billion. That means any offer from the Google parent company would likely surpass that. This wouldn’t be a problem for Alphabet with its cash reserves of $110.9 billion. Of course, there are other troubles that could crop up from such a deal. That includes antitrust regulators potentially standing in the way of it. This is reportedly one of the factors that Alphabet has been seeking advice about from Morgan Stanley, reports Reuters.  With a potential deal on the horizon, it wouldn’t be surprising if HUBS stock see extra activity in these next few days. That’s already started with more than 1.4 million shares of the stock changing hands this morning. This is above its daily average trading volume of about 430,000 shares. HUBS stock is up 6.2% as of Thursday morning. The stock is also up 21.5% since the start of the year. Investors seeking more of the most recent stock market stories are in luck!

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips When determining which stocks to invest in, it’s important to decide whether their operating sectors are prosperous and performing well. If very few consumers are eating out, buying shares of a restaurant probably would not be a good idea. I’d recommend doing research on the industries set to dominate the second half of 2024 prior to making your stock picks for the year. In order to ascertain which sectors will outperform in the near-to-medium term, it’s important to consider the impact of strong macro trends. Artificial intelligence and the rapidly growing consumer spending in the U.S. are two of the most dominant macro trends. Despite the recent rise, I believe that we can expect interest rates to come down at least 0.75 percentage points this year. I kept those macro trends in mind when choosing these industries set to dominate the second half of 2024. The use of AI is spreading quite rapidly and widely. Indeed, according to an estimate cited by Forbes, “The global artificial intelligence market…. (will) expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 37.3% from 2023 to 2030.” The sector’s revenues are expected to reach $1.8 trillion by 2030. This will greatly benefit the data center industry. Large amounts of data storage and computing power are required for training and delivering AI. Data centers provide both services.  Unsurprisingly given the rapid growth of AI and data centers’ centrality in enabling AI, data center rental costs have increased rapidly. Last year, the average rental rate jumped 18.6% after the metric rose 14.5% in 2022. With the use of AI still rising by large amounts, the demand for data centers is likely to surge in 2024, causing rent to climb again. Among the data center operators that are likely to benefit tremendously are Digital Realty (NYSE:DLR) and Equinix (NASDAQ:EQIX). The amount spent on computer and storage infrastructure for cloud deployment climbed a robust 18.5% in the fourth quarter of last year. Of course, AI is the major catalyst behind the increase. Higher spending on cloud computing and storage tools is positive for cloud infrastructure providers. This includes Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Salesforce (NYSE:CRM). Of course, the trend of higher spending on cloud services is expected to surge this year as AI proliferates. According to Statista, the global outlays by end users on public cloud services is expected to jump to $678.79 billion this year from $563.59 billion in 2023.  On March 13, Morgan Stanley upgraded its rating on the automotive sector to “attractive” from “in-line.” The bank expects many automakers to benefit from stronger-than-expected demand for gasoline-powered vehicles and reduced capital spending. General Motors’ (NYSE:GM) decision to increase its quarterly dividend to 12 cents from 9 cents is making me more upbeat on the sector is. My optimism is also bolstered by renowned investor David Tepper’s purchase of 265,000 shares of GM stock in Q4 2023. Also noteworthy is that the shares of GM and Toyota (NYSE:TM), the two top-selling automakers in the U.S., have a great deal of momentum already. Specifically, GM stock has risen 25% so far in 2024, while Toyota has lodged a 33% gain so far this year. Automakers should also benefit from lower interest rates in the second half of 2024.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Don’t feel the need to jump into the crowded technology plays just because you’re worried about being left behind, as most others around you cash in on high-tech themes such as generative artificial intelligence or augmented reality. There are more than one or two ways to make money in the market, after all! One of those ways is via blue-chip stocks. While such emerging technologies will create generational wealth-building opportunities, loading up on the hot stock of the day could lose you money if you don’t get a good price. At these levels, it’s unclear if you’re buying close to a local peak or if we still have miles’ worth of gains over the coming months or even years. Chasing anything in the stock market (whether it be dividend yield or share price momentum) is never a good idea unless you’re willing to ride the inevitable dips and think a stock is, in fact, not as expensive as it seems. For now, I understand why some investors would rather stick with steady blue chips than chase Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) stock at these heights and risk losing sleep over the trajectory to come.  So here are three blue-chip stocks to consider for investors. There’s been so much drama at the board of Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) of late, with a proxy battle unfolding and activist investor Nelson Peltz pushing for positive change. Despite the haze of uncertainty facing the media giant, investors seem to be happy to pick up the stock in recent months. Part of the reason, I believe, is Disney stock’s historically depressed price tag. However, the even bigger reason for optimism may lie in the potential for huge upper-level management changes that could help accelerate the company’s turnaround plans. Sure, Disney has been already trying to turn the ship around with CEO Bob Iger as its captain. However, the waters have been incredibly rough, arguably too rough to get things moving quickly enough without some outside help. Perhaps an outsider like Peltz and his people is needed to give Disney the agility it needs to march higher again. This makes it one of those blue-chip stocks to consider. Undoubtedly, significant board changes may act as the catalyst DIS stock needs to gain higher again after nine long years of sideways action (the stock actually was a choppy ride in that period). After blasting off more than 50% of last year’s lows, I’m inclined to stick around as any big change for Disney, I believe, is bound to be a positive change.  Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL) stock has been experiencing some wild swings since peaking in the back half of January 2024. Undoubtedly, the first year of Gemini has been quite a mess. But that doesn’t change the fact that Alphabet has some of the best AI researchers on Earth. Most of the best AI innovations may still be hidden from the public. As Alphabet strives to balance capability and safety, I believe it will be difficult for the market to keep dragging GOOG stock sideways (or lower) for too long a time period, especially at today’s very reasonable 26.1 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E). Google Search’s best days may be in the past (or are they?), but arguably, Alphabet, the AI company, ought to be valued more than Alphabet, the search company, at least in my opinion. Either way, an eroding of Google Search’s dominance will at least get some anti-trust regulators off the company’s back as it looks to explore new industries to augment or disrupt (from journalism to healthcare) with the power of AI in its hands. Finally, we have American Express (NYSE:AXP), a credit card company that Warren Buffett seems comfortable owning for decades at a time. The stock recently surged to new highs of around $225 per share, thanks in part to some impressive quarters (and upbeat guidance). With a powerful brand and many loyal, affluent customers by its side, American Express has a unique opportunity to bring them further into the new digital age.  American Express’s “Plan It” payment option is more convenient for cardholders than some of the alternative Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) services that have emerged in recent years. Why bother signing up for another service when it’s all too easy to get a payment plan going with just a few clicks through American Express’ impressive app? Looking ahead, I expect American Express to continue adding new features to its app. Young people, like Millennials, want a seamless digital experience, and the company has given them just that. In the next decade, look for American Express to tap into AI to fight fraud and help it take the personalization factor to the next level. All in all, it’s one of those blue-chip stocks to buy. With such a rich trove of customer data, I expect American Express to be a force in the age of AI and the data cloud.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Some investors prefer to construct their own portfolios in hopes of beating the stock market. Most people with this objective prioritize growth stocks that exhibit promising catalysts. This has led to this list of the most undervalued growth stocks to buy in April. While growth stocks give you the best shot at outperforming the stock market, these same investments can lose significant value if the growth narrative changes. Many growth stocks have lofty valuations as investors think more about what corporations can become rather than what they already are. A misalignment between expectations and reality can cause quite a stir. However, investors can choose undervalued growth stocks that offer strong financial growth and respectable valuations. These are some of the top undervalued growth stocks to consider. Deckers Outdoor (NYSE:DECK) is gaining market share in the athletic apparel industry. While heavyweights like Nike (NYSE:NKE) are growing at slower rates, Deckers Outdoor continues to run laps around the competition.  The corporation has several brands under its umbrella, but the two largest ones are Hoka and Ugg. Revenue and earnings growth both came in at healthy rates in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Sales increased by 16% year-over-year while profits jumped by 40% year-over-year. The recently added member of the S&P 500 has been on an incredible run over the past five years. The stock is up by more than 500% during that stretch. Momentum has continued based on the stock’s 34% year-to-date gain. Shares have doubled over the past year and have a 32 P/E ratio. Deckers Outdoor continues to expand its profit margins while gaining market share. The latest quarter featured a 25% net profit margin. American Express (NYSE:AXP) is a top fintech stock with an impressive dividend program. The firm recently announced a 17% dividend hike. The quarterly dividend now stands at $0.70 per share. American Express has doubled its dividend since 2018 and looks poised to elevate its dividend for many years. The company aims to report 10% year-over-year revenue growth and an EPS growth rate in the mid-teens each year beyond 2026. American Express fulfilled that goal in the fourth quarter with an 11% year-over-year increase in revenue. Net income jumped by 23% year-over-year in that quarter.  The stock has more than doubled over the past five years and comes with a reasonable 20 P/E ratio. The firm has profit margins in the low double-digits and is poised to raise its margins each year for several years. American Express offers reasonable value and a compelling dividend growth rate for long-term investors. The yield is currently 1.24%. This makes it one of those most undervalued growth stocks to buy in April. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is arguably the most undervalued member of the Magnificent Seven. The advertising giant trades at a 29 P/E ratio and has been expanding its profit margins thanks to cost-cutting and top-line growth. The corporation reported 13% year-over-year revenue growth in Q4 2023 as its advertising segment continues to rebound. The 13% growth rate is an acceleration from last year’s 7% year-over-year growth rate. Alphabet also reported $20.7 billion in net income which is 52% higher than last year’s profits. Google Cloud revenue continues to grow at a faster pace than the company’s advertising network. Cloud revenue reached $9.2 billion, which was 25.6% higher than in the same period last year. Google Cloud had a $186 million net loss in Q4 2022 but turned in $864 million worth of profits in Q4 2023. Alphabet stock is up by 49% over the past year. It has also gained 158% over the past five years and recently claimed an all-time high. It’s also one of those most undervalued growth stocks to buy in April.  Most investors wouldn’t consider big bank stocks as growth stocks. However, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) is an exception. The financial institution has outperformed the S&P 500 with a 53% gain over the past year. JPMorgan has also been up by 89% over the past five years and offers a 2.31% dividend yield. The corporation regularly posts high-profit margins that hover above 25%. The stock also has a 12 P/E ratio which offers a good margin of safety. JPMorgan reported $9.3 billion in net income in the fourth quarter of 2023. It’s slightly down from last year but still paved the way for a 26% profit margin. Net income would have been $12.1 billion if it weren’t for losses related to the FDIC special assessment and discretionary securities losses. Revenue increased by 11% year-over-year. Any banking fears can create a good opportunity for JPMorgan. The company swooped in to acquire First Republic as that bank was about to go under, and it could follow suit with other banks. When banks shut down, customers tend to put their money into big banks like JPMorgan to ride the uncertainty. Synopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS) is a semiconductor company that creates high-performance silicon chips. You can find these chips in machine-learning devices, self-driving cars, computers, appliances, and other resources. The company has been in business for more than 35 years and has annual revenue in excess of $5 billion. The semiconductor firm trades at a 44 forward P/E ratio and has a $63 billion market cap. The stock is up by 47% over the past year and has soared by 389% over the past five years. Synopsis reported a strong first quarter to start fiscal 2024. Revenue increased by 21% year-over-year while net income surged by 65% year-over-year. The company’s net profit margin reached 27% in the quarter. All in all, it’s one of those most undervalued growth stocks to buy in April.  Synopsys stands to benefit from artificial intelligence tailwinds. Another key catalyst is the company’s upcoming acquisition of Ansys (NASDAQ:ANSS). The acquisition will help Synopsys gain market share and sustain high revenue and earnings growth rates. Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) offers an essential service. The company produces construction equipment and has been around for almost 100 years. The corporation has stayed relevant and expanded through various economic cycles, including the Great Depression. The stock trades at an 18 P/E ratio and offers a 1.43% yield. Shares are up by 59% over the past year and have rallied by 160% over the past five years. Caterpillar has an impressive dividend program and recently hiked its quarterly payout from $1.20 per share to $1.30 per share. That’s an 8.3% year-over-year increase. Caterpillar recently reported a 13% year-over-year increase in full-year sales. The corporation also returned $7.5 billion to shareholders in 2023 via dividends and stock buybacks. Record sales and adjusted profit per share indicate the stock can continue to gain momentum from current levels. The stock is rated as a “Moderate Buy” with the highest price target of $395 per share indicating an 8% upside.  Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is gushing with cash flow after prioritizing profits in 2023. Net income more than tripled in the fourth quarter of 2023 and prompted the company to issue its first dividend. Revenue growth came in at an impressive 25% year-over-year. That’s an acceleration from the company’s 16% year-over-year revenue growth for all of 2023. The company has a robust advertising network that continues to attract new users and increase the engagement of existing users. The number of daily active users across Meta Platforms’ social networks increased by 8% year-over-year. Monthly active users were up by 6% year-over-year across all of its platforms. Businesses can use advanced targeting features to get in front of the right customers. This advantage makes it more difficult for companies to switch from Meta Platforms to another opportunity that can generate similar returns. Meta Platforms trades at a 33 P/E ratio and offers a 0.40% dividend yield. It’s also one of those most undervalued growth stocks to buy in April.

      "Analyst Justin Post of Bank of America Securities maintained a Buy rating on Alphabet Class A (GOOGL – Research Report), retaining the price target of $173.00. Justin Post has given his Buy rating due to a combination of factors reflecting Alphabet Class A’s potential in the evolving digital landscape. Alphabet’s exploration of a paid tier for its AI-powered search features is a key point of interest. The proposed model would enable the company to recover additional costs associated with the implementation of these advanced AI capabilities while preserving profit margins. This strategic move could also mitigate public relations risks by initially offering the service to a smaller, paying customer base, before rolling it out more broadly as costs potentially decline over time. \n",
      "Moreover, Post considers Alphabet’s strong financial position, which allows for significant investment in consumer AI capabilities in contrast to smaller competitors. Upcoming events such as the Google Cloud Next Conference and the Google I/O could serve as catalysts for the stock, potentially propelling it given the expected acceleration in online advertising. These factors, paired with the anticipation of new AI services attracting paid subscribers, contribute to Post’s optimistic view of Alphabet’s stock, maintaining a Buy recommendation with a price objective of 173.00 USD. In another report released on April 2, Barclays also assigned a Buy rating to the stock with a $173.00 price target.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) dominates the U.S. search-engine market. The company continues to introduce value-added features to enhance the online shopping experience. However, Alphabet stock gets a “B” grade instead of an “A” as the company is a target of a regulatory probe that could be costly and complicated. For most investors, it will be fine to own at least a few GOOG stock shares. After all, Alphabet is a “Magnificent Seven” member and one of the world’s most important tech businesses. At the same time, there is headline risk associated with Alphabet, so there’s no need to go overboard in your position size. Much of Alphabet stock’s value stems from Google’s continued innovation in online search and shopping features. For example, Google introduced a new feature called Style Recommendations, which allows users to rate the results of their product searches. The Style Recommendations feature mainly applies to results from queries about clothing, shoes and accessories. Users can swipe right or left to express approval or rejection of product-search results. Style Recommendations users can skip items they’re unsure about.  Google is evidently still trying out new artificial intelligence enhanced features. According to Sourcing Journal, Google recently “developed an AI-powered image generation software that helps users search for products using a visual input.” This could be an ideal companion to Google’s “virtual try-on tool,” which gives users an idea of wearable items might look. Clearly, as as Google continues to advance innovative concepts, Alphabet will remain on the forefront of online search and shopping technology. However, sometimes giant, successful companies can come under fire from government entities. Thus, Alphabet is one of multiple Big Tech businesses currently being investigated by antitrust regulators in the European Union. Alphabet could end up paying substantial fines if it’s found to be in violation of the EU’s Digital Markets Act. According to Reuters, such violations “could result in fines of as much as 10% of the companies’ global annual turnover.”  It’s difficult to know how much Alphabet will push back against the EU’s regulations. Oliver Bethell, Google’s competition director, asserted that the company “will continue to defend our approach in the coming months.” Is this meant to imply that Google and Alphabet will wage a protracted legal battle against regulators in the EU? Only time will tell, so stay tuned for further developments as this story unfolds. Alphabet still has room to improve in the generative-AI field. However, the company constantly introduces new and interesting ideas to enhance the online search and shopping experience. On the other hand, investors shouldn’t overlook Alphabet’s regulatory hurdles in the EU. Overall, Alphabet’s headline risk is notable but doesn’t need to be a deal-breaker. Hence, we’re assigning a “B” grade to Alphabet stock and consider it appropriate for a moderately sized share position.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang is the business equivalent of Caitlin Clark. By that I mean the performance of Nvidia stock in 2024 has made him a legend. His $79.4 billion fortune makes him the 18th richest person in the world. That wealth is up four-fold in a year. Huang’s every public utterance is picked through for lessons in excellence. “I hope suffering happens to you,” he says, and we nod in agreement. “If I had to do it all over again I wouldn’t.” But what does this mean for a small equity investor? Nothing good. When a rumor spread April 1 that Nvidia had bought the Xbox brand from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), reporters began analyzing it before looking at the calendar. Nvidia’s leadership in AI is now taken for granted. Its Blackwell technology guarantees that artificial general intelligence will be here in a few years.  Huang has made thousands of CEOs into techno-optimists, with tricks like talking robots and brute force computing replacing human intuition. The company’s recent Developer Conference quickly became an “AI Woodstock,” filled with demonstrations and claims that aren’t in the market yet. Nvidia stock has had a rough time getting over $900/share in the last month for a reason. Nvidia’s $2.25 trillion valuation is held up by quarterly revenue that tripled in a single year, and profit margins of 72%. Its operating cash flow in 2024 was three times the previous record, and analysts see it doubling again in 2025. But even given all that, its current valuation is outlandish. It trades at 20 times that expected 2025 revenue, and 16 times the expected fiscal 2026 revenue of $136 billion.  Assume for a moment Nvidia stock can hit the $42/share of earnings estimated by the most optimistic analysts for 2026. You’re paying 21 times those earnings to own the stock right now. Logic says it’s time to take something off the table. There are signs in the AI community that the brute force AI approach made possible by Nvidia may be sub-optimal. There are signs that a model with 1 trillion parameters could be analyzed with much less hardware than we once imagined. It turns out bigger isn’t always better. The signs seen by data scientists aren’t yet being seen by AI analysts. But they are being seen by the Cloud Czars who are Nvidia’s biggest customers. Small models may outperform bigger ones. It’s possible to run an AI model on a phone.  Every emerging technology goes through what Gartner (NYSE:IT) calls a hype cycle. Generative AI is now at the peak of expectations. What analysts should be looking for is an event that starts the “trough of disillusionment.” That’s a necessary sell-off before we figure out the true value of AI and start making money from it. I know where the trough hit the original Internet bubble, because I was there. It came on January 10, 2000, when Time Warner “bought” AOL. AOL was so over-valued it owned 55% of the resulting company. At that point Internet asset valuations reached their peak. They proved out in time. Amazon.Com (NASDAQ:AMZN) hit its 1999 price in 2009 and never looked back. Companies like Alphabet (NASDASQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) that understood what their business was prospered.  Nvidia stock will, too. But there’s a hard rain going to fall before that happens. We saw it in 2000, we saw it in 2008, and we saw it in 2022. You don’t want to be in it when the storm hits. I can’t tell you what event might set it off. Maybe Nvidia really will buy the Xbox. That would do it. As of this writing, Dana Blankenhorn had LONG positions in NVDA, MSFT, AMZN, and GOOGL.

      "The “Magnificent Seven” is a term coined to describe big tech giants such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), Meta (NASDAQ:META), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). Each of these stocks gained at least 49% in 2023 and have strong competitive advantages. Here, I have shortlisted one Magnificent Seven stock, Alphabet, to see if it is a good buy right now. Overall, I am bullish on Alphabet due to its attractive valuation, the AI megatrend, and its expanding profit margins. Alphabet is the parent company of Google, the largest search engine platform globally. Valued at $1.93 trillion, Alphabet generates a majority of its sales from online ads on its search engine and YouTube, which Google acquired more than a decade ago. Moreover, Alphabet sells applications, digital content, and in-app purchases via the Google Play store. In recent years, Alphabet has entered high-growth segments such as public cloud and artificial intelligence, diversifying its revenue streams in the process. Shares of Alphabet went public in August 2004 and have since returned a monstrous 5,637%. It means a $1,000 investment in GOOGL stock soon after its IPO would be worth close to $60,000 today. In this period, the S&P 500 Index (SPX) returned “just” 600%.  Despite an uncertain macro environment in 2023, Alphabet increased its sales by 9% year-over-year to $307 billion. Its top-line growth accelerated to 13% in the December quarter, surpassing $86 billion. A focus on cost optimization meant the company’s cost of sales rose by only 5% to $23.6 billion, while operating expenses stood at $25 billion, up 11%, allowing the tech giant to report an operating income of $23.7 billion, up 30% compared to the year-ago period, indicating a healthy margin of 27%. A high operating margin translates into free cash flow, which can be deployed to reinvest in organic growth, enhance shareholder wealth, and target accretive acquisitions. In Q4, Alphabet reported free cash flow of $7.9 billion, while the number was much higher at $69 billion in 2023. Similar to other tech heavyweights, Alphabet allocated $62 billion to share buybacks for its Class A and Class C shares last year and ended 2023 with $111 billion in total cash. Alphabet is among the leading players in the artificial intelligence space. In fact, the company is deploying AI capabilities to improve its portfolio of products from Search to ads. In the last year, Alphabet launched AI-powered products such as Bard and Gemini, which should fuel the next generation of advances.  While Gemini has encountered some issues, the platform is engineered to understand and combine text, images, audio, video, and code while running on devices ranging from smartphones to data centers. Alphabet emphasized that it is experimenting with Gemini in Search, making SGE (Search Generative Experience) faster for users. By integrating AI with Search, Alphabet serves a wide range of information requirements. Bard is Alphabet’s conversational AI tool that is powered by Gemini Pro. Available in 40 languages and 230 countries, Bard will remain a key platform for Alphabet, going forward. Alphabet ended 2023 with more than $15 billion in annual subscription revenue, primarily driven by YouTube. Today, YouTube Music and YouTube Premium are available in more than 100 countries, and these platforms enjoy a highly engaged user base. Generally, recurring sales allow a company to generate steady cash flows across market cycles. Alphabet’s increase in subscription sales over the years showcases its ability to deliver high-value offerings to a wide range of users.  Another subscription service offered by Alphabet is Google One, where you pay to store your photos, videos, files, and other data. Google One is experiencing strong user growth and has attracted almost 100 million subscribers to date. Turning to Google Cloud, the business increased sales by 26% year-over-year in Q4 to $9.2 billion. The segment is now reporting consistent profits, ending Q4 with an operating income of $864 million, indicating a margin of 9%. For FY 2023, Google Cloud sales rose 26% to $33 billion, accounting for more than 10% of total revenue. Google Cloud aims to integrate Gemini to widen its base of enterprise customers which should also drive engagement rates higher. Alphabet claimed strong demand for its vertically integrated AI portfolio will create new opportunities for Google Cloud across its product portfolio. Out of the 37 analyst ratings given to GOOGL stock, 29 are Buys, eight are Holds, and none are Sells, indicating a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average GOOGL stock price target is $165.28, indicating upside potential of 6.7% from current levels. Analysts tracking GOOGL stock expect adjusted earnings to expand from $5.80 per share in 2023 to $6.81 per share in 2024 and $7.85 per share in 2025. So, priced at 22.8x forward earnings, Google stock is not too expensive, even though it trades at a higher multiple than peers, as its bottom line is forecast to grow by more than 15% annually in the next two years.  Alphabet is a company firing on all cylinders. Despite its massive size, the tech behemoth continues to grow revenue and earnings at an enviable pace while improving profit margins. Additionally, its investments in AI should equip Alphabet with the resources to gain traction in the highly disruptive market over time. Disclosure\n"

      "(RTTNews) - Alphabet, Inc.'s (GOOG) Google is working on a new feature called Device Bound Session Credentials or DBSC to stop hackers from stealing cookies and using them to hijack accounts. Cookies are widely used by websites to store user's browsing information and preferences to keep the user signed in, allowing them to skip log-in authentication process in the future. However, these cookies are often targeted by hackers, who use malware to attack them and steal the authentication information. The tech giant said that its DBSC feature will combat the cookie theft by cryptographically binding the authentication cookies to the user's device with the help of Trusted Platform Module or TPM chip. \"By binding authentication sessions to the device, DBSC aims to disrupt the cookie theft industry since exfiltrating these cookies will no longer have any value,\" explained Kristian Monsen, a software engineer on Google's Chrome Counter Abuse team. \"We think this will substantially reduce the success rate of cookie theft malware. Attackers would be forced to act locally on the device, which makes on-device detection and cleanup more effective, both for anti-virus software as well as for enterprise managed devices.\"  DBSC, currently in prototype phase, allows a server to start a new session on the browser by associating it with a public key stored in the device using Application Programming Interface or API. The feature links a unique key with each session, disabling the sites to track the user's activities across different sessions. \"When it's deployed fully, consumers and enterprise users will get upgraded security for their Google accounts under the hood automatically,\" Monsen ensured as the feature will initially support only half of all Chrome desktop devices. \"We are also working to enable this technology for our Google Workspace and Google Cloud customers to provide another layer of account security,\" Monsen added.\n",
      "(RTTNews) - Several users of Microsoft Outlook have recently reported facing issues with their legitimate emails being blocked after Google implemented new mandatory bulk sender authentication requirements for Gmail. The issue has caused frustration among some Outlook users as their emails to Gmail recipients are being flagged as spam, and they are unable to reach their intended audience. Microsoft has acknowledged the problem and confirmed that some users with Outlook.com country domains are having trouble sending emails to Gmail accounts. The company has posted a notification on the Outlook.com support page to inform its users about the situation. According to the notification, affected Outlook users are receiving subsequent emails from Gmail's servers notifying them that their messages were deemed suspicious and prevented from reaching the recipient's inbox. While Microsoft investigates the situation, they have suggested a temporary solution until a permanent fix is put in place. The solution is to add an Outlook.com alias to accounts and use that alias to send emails to Gmail users. Outlook aliases are additional email addresses connected to the Outlook.com account, sharing the same inbox, contact list, and account settings as the primary email address.  Microsoft has not provided any detailed information about the cause of the issue, but they have stated that affected users should utilize the proposed remedy until the Outlook team resolves the problem. Google is now blocking emails from bulk senders who do not adhere to stricter spam thresholds and authentication requirements outlined in new guidelines aimed at enhancing defenses against spam, phishing attacks, and malware. Starting in June, Google will enforce these new requirements to prevent spam, phishing, and malware from reaching users' inboxes. The new guidelines are part of Google's efforts to provide its users with a safe and secure email experience.\n",

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Being the king of AI chip stocks, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is surely a piping hot stock every long-term growth investor is itching to own. Surging nearly 250% in 2023, Nvidia stock is up more than 85% year-to-date, and showing not signs of slowing down anytime soon. Of course, most of this drastic valuation increase has to do with Nvidia’s stranglehold on the high-performance computing market. The company’s AI semiconductors and GPUs are the dominant option for companies worldwide looking to create AI applications and run interfaces in this high-growth space. Until that changes, this rally really does look unstoppable. Today, most sectors, whether it’s from in technology or elsewhere, are looking to pivot into AI or integrate AI into their processes. Analysts predict the AI market could reach $2 trillion by 2030, with plenty of value being accrued to the current dominant leader in this space. Here’s why I think Nvidia’s current multiple has been validated by the market, and could actually represent a reasonable level, given the company’s noted ability to outperform in terms of its fundamentals.  Tech giants everywhere are collaborating to counter Nvidia’s AI dominance. This speaks to the company’s dominant position in this space, resulting in the formation of the Unified Acceleration Foundation (UXL). The coalition, including Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and others, aims to develop open-source software enabling AI code to run universally. This group targets a mature project phase by year-end. After reaching a $2 trillion market cap, Nvidia stock is more driven to create AI-focused hardware that can be even better than its existing H100 and H200 chips. Despite Nvidia’s dominance with CUDA architecture, rivals are developing alternatives amid chip scarcity. UXL aims to create open-source solutions for AI and computing, seeking collaboration from chipmakers and cloud giants—Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) rumored partnership with AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) is yet another example of competitive interests lining up against Nvidia stock. I think this reality is largely bullish for Nvidia right now. It showcases the company’s dominance, and while other lower-priced options are necessary, means that Nvidia’s positioning in the high-performance computing space will be hard to challenge. I think Nvidia’s moat is only getting wider, with the release of its recent Blackwell GPU the latest innovation to turn heads. The previous year, Nvidia dominated the AI chip market with an estimated 90% share, leading to remarkable earnings. In its latest quarter (Q4 of fiscal 2024, ending in January), revenue surged by 265% to $22 billion, with operating income soaring by 983% to nearly $14 billion. This growth was fueled by a 409% increase in data center revenue, driven by AI GPU sales. The company’s free cash flow skyrocketed by 430% to over $27 billion, surpassing AMD’s $1 billion and Intel’s notable $14 billion. Despite the competition’s new GPU releases, Nvidia’s AI advantage likely propelled it ahead, ensuring robust cash reserves for continued innovation and market leadership. Moreover, the company now sits in third place in the race to be the world’s most valuable company, just behind Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft.  Despite this rapid growth, Nvidia’s stock has appreciated over the past year. Key valuation metrics like the price-earnings ratio and price-to-free-cash-flow ratio indicate favorable investment potential, coupled with its leading position in a thriving industry and substantial cash reserves. During an Nvidia event last week, Jensen Huang introduced Blackwell, Nvidia’s revolutionary GPU architecture, poised to redefine computing. Named after David Blackwell, this ambitious project marks a significant milestone in Silicon Valley’s history. Nvidia exceeded Q4 earnings estimates, soaring revenue by 265% to $22.1 billion. The company anticipates 2024 sales of around $24 billion and an implied bottom line of $5.41 per share. Analyst Timothy Arcuri raised Nvidia’s price target to $1,100, citing an expected surge in demand. Arcuri likened the framework to a centralized distribution system akin to an app store, foreseeing significant revenue potential from licensing Nvidia’s AI Enterprise software at $4,500 per GPU per year. He advocated for capitalizing on any short-term declines as buying opportunities. Nvidia has clearly emerged as a leading AI stock, and while some of the stock’s recent rise can be tied to hype, most of this company’s performance is fundamentals-based. Indeed, despite surging roughly more than three-fold over the past 18 months, this is a stock that still looks reasonably-valued based on its forward-looking prospects.  The data center and professional visualization segments saw remarkable sales growth of over 400% and 100% year-over-year. Additionally, Nvidia announced its inaugural quarterly dividend, offering investors promising fundamentals and growth prospects, particularly in the AI sector. For long-term investors, Nvidia remains the go-to option in this space. I just don’t see that changing, for at least the next decade. Accordingly, I think investors would do well to consider this stock on dips moving forward.

      "In a report released yesterday, Ken Gawrelski from Wells Fargo maintained a Hold rating on Alphabet Class A (GOOGL – Research Report), with a price target of $141.00. Ken Gawrelski has given his Hold rating due to a combination of factors, primarily involving Alphabet Class A’s near-term revenue expectations and market share concerns. Despite the tech giant’s significant past growth, Gawrelski remains cautious, noting that the return on ad spending (ROAS) metrics are flattening, which may signal a plateau in efficiency gains from Google’s search advertising. His analysis suggests revenues will be below the Street’s consensus, and he anticipates Alphabet will lose some digital ad market share, particularly within the search segment, throughout the fiscal year due to the competitive rise of retail media networks. Moreover, Gawrelski underscores the importance of the upcoming first-quarter earnings, particularly the search revenue performance, as pivotal for investor sentiment and stock valuation. The market is looking for evidence of growth acceleration to counteract concerns from the ‘law of large numbers’ narrative. While acknowledging several potential catalysts on the horizon, including a host of regulatory and industry events, these factors introduce both opportunities and risks. The report also includes adjustments to revenue forecasts and an updated price target that factors in foreign exchange headwinds and recent settlements, reinforcing the rationale for maintaining an Equal Weight rating on the shares of Alphabet Class A.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips The stock market is dragging Monday’s losses into Tuesday as Treasury yields rise to their highest level all year. Why are stocks down today? Well, it appears investors are continuing to show concerns that interest rate cuts may not arrive until the second half of the year. With jobs data coming in strong this morning, as inflation proves more stubborn that predicted, some economists believe the Federal Reserve is being granted further leeway to hold off cutting rates. This includes former Fed president Dennis P. Lockhart.  “As long as the economy is tolerating this level of interest rates and the progress is slow at best in disinflationary terms, I don’t see them moving,” Lockhart told Yahoo Finance, referring to the chance of a rate cut at the upcoming Fed policy meeting. At the time of writing, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are down 0.74% and 0.93%, respectively. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is on track to be the day’s biggest loser, however, it is down 0.98% heading to the bell. The 10-year Treasury yield is trending around 4.37% today, its highest level in 2024, potentially reflecting a sort of “flight-to-safety” trade as investors ditch relatively high-risk stocks for guaranteed fixed-income assets. This marks the second straight day of losses for the widely watched indices, fueling concerns that stocks’ strong first-quarter performance may be erased in a cold second-quarter reversal. Once-darling electric vehicle (EV) maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) continues to lead the bears, down more than 5% today after announcing it delivered fewer cars than expected in its first quarter.  Tesla is the biggest S&P 500 loser this year, having shed nearly 40% of its weight, equivalent to more than $230 billion in lost value. With Tesla, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) underperforming the market this year, some analysts have started dropping the “Magnificent Seven,” the name for the top seven tech stocks. Instead, replacing the term with the “Fabulous Four,” consisting of just Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). “If you’d have told me eight weeks ago that Apple and Tesla would be down as much as they are, oh and by the way, you’re punting when you’re going to do the rate cuts and you’re getting less rate cuts, I would have assumed the market would be down,” Ryan Detrick, Chief Market Strategist at Carson Group, told the Wall Street Journal.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Former president Donald Trump’s social media platform Truth Social (NASDAQ:DJT) gained significant attention last week. However, other social media stocks saw price increases, too. There is debate whether the broader rise in social media stocks boosted Truth Social or if the focus on the new microblogging site drove greater interest. Recently listed Reddit (NYSE:RDDT) also experienced gains and has continued moving higher with peers.The increased focus raises a logical question — whether an investment opportunity exists within social media stocks. Truth Social and Reddit may experience more volatile performance as newcomers before releasing initial earnings reports. In the interim, several social media stocks that have been publicly traded for longer could offer opportunities.Ongoing legislative considerations regarding a potential ban on TikTok are adding complexity to the social media landscape. U.S. regulators have requested it divest from its parent company, ByteDance. Extensive speculation surrounds possible outcomes: which social media company may benefit from users should the app be prohibited, who would acquire TikTok, and whether it would be another industry competitor if divested.​ Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is the first pick in the social media stocks shuffle. It is the largest publicly traded social media company, with a market capitalization exceeding $1 trillion. News outlets have recently highlighted the company as one of the so-called “Magnificent Seven” stocks and for its advancements in artificial intelligence (AI). Growing interest in the metaverse provides additional context for the company’s long-term prospects. Meta also owns Instagram, which is TikTok’s direct competitor. It will likely benefit the most if the Chinese-owned video-sharing app is excluded from the United States market. TikTok generated an estimated $16 billion in revenue in the U.S. last year. A ban on TikTok could divert billions in revenues towards META. Even if a ban does not occur, ongoing developments surrounding TikTok could enable META to increase its market share.​ Pinterest (NYSE:PINS), the image-sharing and social media platform, saw its stock price increase last week. However, shares remain in negative territory year to date (YTD). Last year, Pinterest increased its user base by 11%. Additionally, the company substantially reduced losses through cost-reduction initiatives. Its average revenue per user (ARPU), a key performance indicator, rose 1.2%, demonstrating its ability to maintain monetization.  Analysts believe the company is well-positioned to strengthen its financial performance. Consensus price target for the second pick in the social media stocks sits at an average of $43.15. This represents a potential upside of nearly 30% from current levels. With $2.5 billion in cash reserves, Pinterest has strong liquidity to continue executing its strategic priorities. The market expects the social media platform to return to profitability by the close of the current year. Rumble (NASDAQ:RUM), a video hosting company seeking to compete with Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) YouTube platform, has often been overlooked within the sector. However, the social media stock price has trended higher throughout 2024, even as losses widened due to rising hosting costs and content investment to attract viewers. Investors appeared reassured by Rumble’s $218.3 million cash position despite $29 million in negative profits. Rumble is one of those social media stocks that have climbed already higher. It follows explosive gains in DJT after its special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) merger with Digital World Acquisition (NASDAQ:DWAC) and subsequent Nasdaq listing. Additionally, the company gained notable attention from reports that it may have participated in acquiring TikTok. While not the sole bidder, it could share benefits from involvement in a consortium to assume management of TikTok.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD) has an Investor Index that tracks the top 100 most owned investments on Robinhood, in aggregate. The Investor Index outperformed the Nasdaq 100 in 2021 but currently lags the popular benchmark over the past five years. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Gamestop (NYSE:GME), and AMC (NYSE:AMC) are some of the Top 10 holdings in the Investor Index, which helps to explain its underperformance. The index has some good investment ideas among the riskier and speculative assets available. Investors looking for good stock ideas may want to review this list. Yet, it’s important to take it with a grain of salt based on some of the companies within the top 10. Let’s examine some of the most undervalued Robinhood stocks that can reward long-term investors. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is the largest advertising platform thanks to Google and YouTube. Billions of people visit these websites each month to find educational resources and entertaining content. Also, the company enjoys a fast-growing cloud computing segment that makes up more than 10% of its total revenue.  Additionally, Alphabet is diversifying beyond advertising, and its financials have improved due to those efforts. Revenue increased by 13% year over year (YOY) in Q4 of 2023 while net income increased by more than 50% YOY. Also, the stock trades at a 28 P/E ratio, which is lower than most of the Magnificent Seven stocks. Alphabet has been making meaningful efforts to improve its net profit margins, which should make the valuation more attractive to long-term investors. Shares are up by 46% over the past year and have gained 152% over the past five years. Thus, this Robinhood favorite offers a good valuation and promising growth opportunities like cloud computing and artificial intelligence. The PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) growth story isn’t what it used to be. Although shares have been down by 37% over the past five years and well removed from their all-time high, the P/E ratio is grabbing investors’ attention. In fact, the stock trades at a 17.5 P/E ratio and is up by 9% year to date (YTD). And, the company’s recent financial report demonstrates that it’s no longer a growth stock. Revenue only increased by 9% YOY. However, the valuation reflects decelerating revenue growth, and GAAP EPS increased by 61% YOY. Also, the company is strengthening its profit margins which can make up for lower top-line growth. PayPal needs revenue growth to accelerate if it wants to maintain impressive net income growth. However, the stock is priced at a reasonable level and offers a relatively limited downside compared to other tech stocks.  Currently, the stock is rated as a moderate buy among 36 analysts. None of these analysts rated the stock as a sell but more than half of them rated it as a hold. Risk-averse investors who want to capitalize on some upside in the event of a recovery may want to consider this stock. Visa (NYSE:V) is another fintech company, but its prospects look more promising than PayPal’s. The stock has gained 24% over the past year and is up by 8% YTD. The stock is now rated as a strong buy with a projected 11% upside from the current price. The highest price target of $335 per share implies Visa stock can gain an additional 20%. Further, Wall Street analysts feel bullish about the stock, and financials fuel that sentiment. Revenue increased by 9% YOY while net income jumped by 17% YOY in Q1 FY24. Profit margin expansion has been a key theme for Visa earnings, and the company’s net profit margins now exceed 50%. Finally, Visa plows a lot of money into stock buybacks and dividends. The corporation allocated $4.4 billion toward those initiatives to start off the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Also, Visa has a tremendous dividend growth program. The fintech company raised its quarterly dividend from $0.45 per share to $0.52 per share in 2023. That’s a 15.6% YOY increase. On this date of publication, Marc Guberti held a long position in GOOG.

      "(RTTNews) - Google has agreed to delete billions of users' browsing history records after facing a class-action lawsuit that accused the company of harvesting data from users who believed they were privately browsing the internet in Chrome's 'Incognito' mode. The lawsuit, which was initiated in 2020, represented millions of Google users who had used private browsing between June 2016 and December 2023. Despite Google's defense in the lawsuit, US District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers declined a motion to dismiss the case in August, leading to a potential trial. Initially set for February, the trial date has now been rescheduled to July 30 in Oakland, California federal court. The settlement does not protect Google from further lawsuits related to the issues addressed in the class-action lawsuit. This enables individual consumers to seek damages by filing their own civil complaints in various state courts across the US. Attorney David Boies, who represented the plaintiffs, referred to the settlement as a significant step towards holding dominant technology companies accountable in a statement to The Wall Street Journal. The plaintiffs argued that Google had violated federal wiretapping and privacy laws by tracking and collecting user data, including their browsing history, IP addresses, and device information, without their consent. Lawyers estimated the settlement to be between $5 billion and $7.8 billion, based on calculations primarily related to potential ad revenue that could have been generated from the personal information collected through Chrome in the past and future without the new restrictions.  While the lawsuit did not achieve class-action status for financial damages, some users promptly filed individual lawsuits. The settlement is expected to have a significant impact on the way tech companies handle user data and privacy issues in the future, as it sets a precedent for holding them accountable for their actions.\n",
      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Chinese stocks are so incredibly unloved these days after many years of being dragged down by the bears. Undoubtedly, the geopolitical risks associated with the names are still very much present. However, you may be enticed by the rise of technological innovations (think generative AI). But, you don’t want to pay a pretty penny for exposure. In that case, the Chinese tech scene may be worth a second look while it’s still down and out. Undoubtedly, China is home to some serious large-cap AI innovators, with many going for multiples that seem too good to be true. Even if China’s tech titans were to unlock next-level value via generative AI, it’s uncertain that international investors would risk their wealth in the Chinese markets. Indeed, geopolitical tensions alone may be enough reason to scratch any Chinese stock off your radar. If you’re okay with the risk profile and want to expand your investment horizons, consider three undervalued buys. Chinese stocks are worthy of attention as the AI boom unfolds in markets beyond the U.S. Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) may be considered by many as the Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL) or Google of China. With an impressive AI business and reported discussions with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) regarding its potential future devices sold in China, it’s not a mystery as to why the stock may be perceived as an overlooked AI gem.  Indeed, BIDU American Depository Receipts (ADRs) crept higher following the potential Apple chatter. If the deal actually comes to be, though, Baidu could have more upside as investors realize the magnitude of such a deal. China is undoubtedly a huge market. And, an Apple-Baidu partnership could have the potential to profoundly benefit both firms as AI and smart devices merge. For now, BIDU looks incredibly cheap at 14.2 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) given its AI-fueled growth prospects. Expect this to continue to be discounted as investors increasingly steer away from Chinese stocks. Alibaba (NASDAQ:BABA) is another Chinese tech laggard with impressive AI innovations. Yet, it may be able to reverse its multi-year funk. Undoubtedly, dip-buyers have continued to be punished by a stock that sinks lower over time. As the company continues AI innovation, its open-source large language models rival the likes of ChatGPT. So, perhaps value-seeking AI investors may embrace the painful ride of BABA stock. Additionally, Alibaba is standing out as a fast-moving cloud player that may benefit from the same AI-driven dynamics as America’s top cloud companies. All considered, Alibaba looks like a deep value play, but only one that’s fit for those willing to risk getting hurt from catching the falling knife. At 13.6 times trailing P/E, the stock appears cheap.  Finally, PDD Holdings (NASDAQ:PDD) is perhaps best known as Pinduoduo, the Chinese tech giant behind the low-cost shopping app Temu. Unlike Baidu and Alibaba, PDD stock has found a way to gain higher in recent years, due to robust sales growth. Indeed, its overseas e-commerce gem, Temu, has been a major growth driver for the firm. For now, it seems like international customers can’t get enough of shopping “like a billionaire” with Temu’s rock-bottom prices. Whether Temu can extend its growth remains to be seen. Regardless, PDD bets big on AI lately as it seeks to even the playing field in large language models. With decent momentum, (shares are up 141% in the past two years), PDD definitely stands out as the most intriguing of the batch. The 27.1 times trailing P/E multiple isn’t all too frothy, either.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Generally, when new technology is introduced, investment opportunities are speculative and risky. This happened first with personal computers, and now, with artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. By now, nearly every big tech company has its hands firmly inside the AI cookie jar, with most small and mid-cap companies also following suit. It’s not an overstatement to say that AI has the potential to be the biggest game-changer in technology since the internet itself. The best AI investments will provide a platform for other tangential businesses. Not only will they be utilizing AI to better serve their customers, but they will be also building new AI-driven products and services to forever change industry dynamics. Here are our three picks for the best AI stocks to consider for your portfolio. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) is one of the world’s largest companies and owns several dominant brands in the tech industry. These include Google Search, YouTube, and the Android operating system. Currently, the stock’s median price target of $163.12 represents a potential 10% upside from its current price. Despite facing a couple of missteps at the start, this big tech company has been one of the first to jump right into the AI waters. Google Bard, for instance, made headlines for producing inaccurate responses that put it a level below ChatGPT. Now though, beyond simply Google Bard, Google has launched AI appliances such as Vertex AI and Project IDX to help websites, workspaces and workflow. As Gemini (a rebranded Bard) slowly becomes the leading generative AI platform integrated into Google’s suite of applications, investors can be optimistic about this company’s strength as one of the AI industry’s leaders.  Alphabet also remains one of the cheapest mega-cap stocks relative to its competitors, trading at just 22.27x forward earnings and 6.25x sales. In terms of earnings, this makes GOOGL cheaper than Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Alphabet’s strength is also demonstrated by its 14 consecutive quarters of increased revenue and five-year revenue CAGR of 18%. As far as AI and blue-chip tech stocks go for us, GOOGL is a no-brainer. Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) is an American software company most recognized for its flagship products including Adobe Acrobat, Illustrator, and Premiere. Yahoo Finance analysts currently give a consensus average price target of about $574.00, 15% higher than today’s closing price. When it comes to AI, you might not immediately think of Adobe. Nonetheless, the company has been leveraging generative AI  to give its creative customers some of the most comprehensive artistic tools. These include the Adobe Firefly platform which will drastically grow the scale of deliverable AI-generated branded content for enterprise users and content creators. In fact, one of the early adopters of Adobe Firefly was Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), which used the platform to create its Dreamworld campaign. Looking at its financials, we see a stock that trades at roughly a fair value compared to its tech industry peers. However, where Adobe truly stands out is its profitability. Adobe currently has an 88.08% gross margin, over 80% higher than its sector median of 48.62%! With a 10-year net income compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 34% as well, we see Adobe as a profitability cash cow in the AI space. Crowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is an American multinational cybersecurity company that was founded in 2011. Yahoo Finance analysts almost all rate it a Buy or Strong Buy, with a median one-year price target nearly 20% higher than its current price.  The bull case for Crowdstrike and AI is twofold. The first case is based on its Falcon platform. This platform is trained on trillions of historical security events and utilizes AI and machine learning to identify, detect, and neutralize potential threats. Additionally, Crowdstrike also has a generative AI security analyst named Charlotte that can help users with its diverse range of products. As elevated cybersecurity concerns arise due to the increase in AI used for malicious reasons, we see Crowdstrike as an investment at the forefront of solving these issues. CRWD has already gained nearly 150% over the past 52 weeks. While its valuation is slightly elevated over its sector mean, we find confidence in its outstanding balance between growth and profitability. For instance, despite growing at a five-year revenue CAGR Of 65%, CRWD has still managed to maintain incredibly strong gross margins of over 75%!

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Mega-cap stocks are solid investments overall for several reasons. Recently, they’ve been responsible for the lion’s share of increases in the S&P 500. An investor who focused solely on mega-cap stocks would have outperformed the stock market overall during that period. So,  a high potential for strong returns is one of the best reasons to consider investing in mega-cap companies. The other primary benefit of investing in mega-cap stocks is that they are generally safe. Most of these companies are also blue chip stocks, meaning that they are household names. They tend to have long track records of impressive performance that suggest continued stability. On top of that, they often provide income in the form of dividends. It all suggests stability. Those are two excellent reasons to consider investing. Let’s look at seven mega-cap stocks that have the potential to double your money within three years. AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) has emerged as a key challenger in the race for artificial intelligence (AI) chip dominance. Generally speaking, that is the reason investors are so interested in the stock currently. Most investors are simply reacting to the general strong sentiment surrounding the firm to rationalize their investment. Dig a little bit deeper, and it’s easy to understand why AMD is indeed a strong investment but also one that can triple within the next few years.  The logic for believing that statement can be found in comments made by CEO Lisa Su. Late last year Sue predicted that the market for AI data center chips could reach $400 billion by 2027. Analysts from New Street research noted that even if data center spending only reaches half that target in that time frame, it would correlate to a potential quadrupling of AMD’s price, which was roughly $130 at that time. That would put its price in the low $500s, which is roughly triple its current price. The arithmetic that governs a potential doubling in ASML (NASDAQ:ASML) stock by 2027 is fairly straightforward. Let’s start by running through that quickly. Analysts currently believe that ASML shares could rise approximately 25% in the next year. That Would bring prices to $1,215 in 2025. Let’s imagine that things continue to go well and progress at the same pace for the next two years. That would bring prices just above $1,500 in 2026  and near $1,900 by 2027. That equates to a doubling from its current price. It’s also perfectly logical to believe that that is possible, given the strength of ASML’s products and their relation to current trends. It’s then one of those mega-cap stocks to consider.  ASML is the leading chip tool maker at the leading edge of the technology. the company enjoys a monopoly over extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV). That technology is used to etch patterns on the most complex chip wafers and is indispensable in relation to artificial intelligence. If the AI trend continues as it has, it’s entirely likely that ASML doubles in that timeframe. Adobe’s (NASDAQ:ADBE) stock, like that of so many other companies on this list,  is rising and falling on the potential of artificial intelligence. The emergence of artificial intelligence is the reason to believe Adobe could double from here. Now is arguably an excellent time to stake a position in the stock. Adobe is well known for Photoshop and other graphics tools that position the firm well in the generative AI race. That’s the primary reason that the stock did so well last year. However, Adobe was unable to monetize it to the level investors had expected. The result is that Shares currently trade for $485. That follows a strong pullback that began in February. I’d argue that it’s an overreaction to the overreaction that created the hype in the first place. Adobe did not end up buying Figma which many believed was a bad deal to begin with. That’s positive news. Adobe just has to figure out how to better monetize Firefly. There’s a huge opportunity, given the demand for AI products in content creation. Adobe can easily double from its current price point by 2027. This makes it one of those mega-cap stocks for investors to consider. Many investors are looking for reasons to invest in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)  stock at the moment. there’s a clear contrarian opportunity for those who can find optimism among all the negativity. Shares currently trade for $170. So, it’s easy to see why they have the potential to double in the next few years, given that they traded above $400 just before quantitative tightening set in.  Don’t be fooled, there is plenty of reason for negativity at the moment. Tesla just released its Q1 delivery figures which were disappointing. Elon Musk’s company delivered 386,810 vehicles during the first quarter representing an 8.6% decline year over year. It was the first time since the pandemic began that deliveries fell. Those delivery figures were also far below numbers analysts had been expecting. Beyond that, competition is heating up in the EV sector. Tesla won’t benefit as strongly from its early competitive advantages moving into the future. However, it isn’t all doom and gloom in the near term. Shipping disruptions in the Red Sea were partially to blame for the lower-than-expected delivery numbers. Furthermore, at some point, the Chinese economy will turn around, and demand will rebound. That should propel Tesla higher in the coming year or so. Despite its strong growth, it’s unlikely to surprise many that Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock has the potential to double from here. Let’s assume two things; one, Nvidia continues to enjoy a dominant position in relation to AI for the next few years, two, strong metrics continue to hold over that period. Under that scenario Nvidia can double by 2027.  Nvidia’s sales are expected to be somewhere in the neighborhood of $102 billion dollars in 2025, per consensus estimates. Some Wall Street analysts believe that revenues could reach $300 billion by 2027 on AI chip sales alone. Nvidia shares would easily double under that scenario and, more realistically, would triple in value, assuming valuations hold steady. Growing from $102 billion in sales in 2025 to $300 billion by 2027 makes that potential very obvious. More likely, though, metrics like the P/E ratio would rise even higher if Nvidia sales grow that quickly. Thus, share prices would more than triple if sales grow to that height by 2027. Could Toyota (NYSE:TM) stock eventually emerge as the biggest winner in the EV revolution?  The answer is a resounding: “Yes!” Toyota has been building ultra-reliable, somewhat uninspiring vehicles for many decades. The company’s nature is to default to data suggestive of reliability in guiding its decision processes. It’s highly likely that Toyota knew that a pure EV strategy was not the way forward based on such data. That got Toyota in trouble relative to other big automobile manufacturers that adopted the EV craze to their detriment. Just look at what has happened to Ford (NYSE:F) and GM (NYSE:GM). Their decision to invest heavily in pure EV technology hasn’t paid off. Toyota believes that a hybrid first strategy is The logical path toward EV profits.  As the EV hype has died down, Toyota suddenly looks brilliant. The point here is not for Toyota to say I told you so but rather that the company’s slower, iterative approach will win in the end. That’s why I believe the company will ultimately emerge as one of the big winners in the EV race over time. Toyota is likely to find profitability from EVs without sinking unnecessary billions of dollars into the technology in an effort to skip the necessary steps. It’s no secret that many investors are betting on Alibaba (NASDAQ:BABA) stock to double in the next few years. Share prices have fallen by more than 75% since late 2020. During that period, Alibaba has gone from a presumed competitor with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to something much less flattering. In any case, it’s very easy to find a narrative in which Alibaba doubles in the next few years. Let’s do some simple arithmetic that proves the possibility is entirely real. Alibaba’s price/sales ratio over the last 10 years has a median of 8.34. However, it currently stands at 1.43. It doesn’t seem likely that it’ll rise to the median anytime soon: the Chinese economy continues to experience difficulty. Alibaba’s shares are unlikely to pop for that reason. However, imagine that the P/S ratio doubles. That would correlate to a doubling of price and more, given that sales are predicted to continue growing, albeit at a slower pace. If the Chinese economy rebounds over the next few years, it’s all entirely possible. This makes it one of those mega-cap stocks to buy.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips If you’re on the lookout for stocks to buy before the next bull market, look no further. Searching the market for stocks that have the potential to rise sharply requires positive market approaches. Market observers are paying close attention to three contenders who stand out. Each makes a distinct argument supported by cunning business moves and cutting-edge technology. To begin with, the first is causing a stir with its grand ambitions for computing infrastructure growth. The corporation is putting itself at the forefront of the emerging metaverse revolution by bolstering its artificial intelligence (AI) research skills. However, the second one is out to restore its position as the semiconductor industry leader. The business prioritizes product variety, transistor performance, and AI. Similarly, the third one’s data center income has increased astoundingly. The third unquestionably dominates this market because of the growing need for AI and rapid computing solutions. Furthermore, it offers previously unheard-of development prospects because of its deliberate worldwide expansion and the growing need for sovereign AI in areas outside of the U.S. and China. Therefore, these three businesses present an opportunity to ride the AI innovation wave, symbolizing the fusion of state-of-the-art technology.  By the end of the year, Meta (NASDAQ:META) expects to have around 600,000 H100 equivalents of compute and about 350,000 H100s in compute infrastructure and AI research. The organization strongly emphasizes investments in cutting-edge computational infrastructure to support AI developments. On the other hand, Meta takes an open-source stance, supporting industry innovation while maintaining proprietary product implementations. The organization’s open-source projects, which include PyTorch development and Llama models, attract top talent. However, robust sales of Quest 3 helped Reality Labs’ revenue exceed $1.1 billion in Q4 2023. To fulfill its vision of the metaverse, Meta keeps making significant investments in AR, VR, and MR technologies. Goods like the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses are well received and support Meta’s expansion plans. Finally, with its investments in cutting-edge technologies, including AI, virtual and augmented reality, and the metaverse, Meta is positioned to lead the industry in innovation. In summary, Meta is committed to delivering transformational experiences to its consumers and growing its AI capabilities, as seen by its major concentration on computing infrastructure. The chip giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) can restore its leadership in transistor and power performance by 2025 and achieve five nodes in four years. Intel 3, the company’s first advanced node, demonstrated steady yield growth and performance.  Moreover, Intel Foundry Services (IFS) made significant strides, securing meaningful collaborations and design accolades. Intel is becoming a major player in the foundry business, with over 75 ecosystem and customer test chips put out and over 50 in the works. With strategic changes like merging its Graphics Group and Accelerated Computing Systems, Intel hopes to expand into new sectors like AI, networking, and automotive and diversify its product line. For instance, products like the Intel Core Ultra CPUs and Intel Xeon Scalable processors are targeted for AI workloads. With that, Intel has made significant strides in developing AI sectors like edge devices and AI computing. Lastly, with its continuous worldwide manufacturing presence, Intel offers reliable access to capacity in all key locations. Hence, the company is on track with its growth initiatives, guaranteeing an adequate supply to keep up with the increasing demand. The $47.5 billion data center revenue predicted for Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) in 2023 is a vital milestone. This shows the segment’s explosive growth and contribution to total business revenue. The data center category has demonstrated robust performance and market dominance, with revenue more than doubled from the previous year. Additionally, the demand for accelerated computing, AI training and inference, data processing, and CUDA-accelerated workloads across several sectors has significantly increased data center revenue. Certainly, all areas had robust revenue growth for Nvidia’s data centers, except China, since U.S. export control laws caused a sharp fall in revenue. Despite this fall, Nvidia has been distributing substitutes that don’t need a license for the Chinese market.  Likewise, another factor driving demand is the need for sovereign AI. Nations are investing in AI infrastructure to support their industry ecosystems and research. These regions are not only the U.S. and China. In short, Nvidia has substantial growth potential and a large market due to its strong presence outside the U.S. and China and the rising need for AI infrastructure and solutions.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips After a big run to start the year, Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock looks to have stalled. But don’t worry. It likely won’t be long before the rally in the chipmaker continues. In the last month, NVDA stock has dipped 5%. The stock has struggled to rise above $950 per share and has retreated each time it hits that level. However, the current pullback comes after Nvidia had a huge run in January and February. Year to date, the stock is up 83% and a leader in the S&P 500 index. The current dip is likely only a temporary breather before NVDA stock again runs flat out. As such, investors would be smart to buy the dip. The rally in Nvidia’s stock that began in earnest at the start of 2023 has pushed the company to some important milestones. Earlier this year, Nvidia’s market capitalization crossed the $2 trillion mark and it is now the third largest publicly traded company in the world after Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). The company’s influence on the market is growing and the main catalyst for NVDA stock continues to be the company’s earnings. Since last summer, the stock market literally pauses in the days ahead of Nvidia’s earnings reports. It’s as if investors and traders are holding their collective breath to see if the company can exceed the lofty expectations that have been set for it. So far, Nvidia hasn’t disappointed and the entire market rallies after the company beats Wall Street’s forecasts. In February, Nvidia reported earnings that covered the final quarter of 2023 that crushed expectations and showed mind boggling growth at the microchip and semiconductor maker.  Fueled by unrelenting demand for its microchips and semiconductors among artificial intelligence (AI) companies around the world, Nvidia reported that its Q4 2023 sales rose 265% year over year, while its profits grew 769% from a year earlier. All metrics topped analysts’ estimates, and the guidance provided was even better. For the just completed first quarter of the year, Nvidia has forecast sales of $24 billion. If achieved, that would be up 234% from sales of $7.19 billion a year earlier. Can Nvidia do it again? There’s no reason to doubt the company at this point. The big question concerning Nvidia on Wall Street is how long can the company continue to exceed the sky high expectations that have been set for it? After all, the comparables the company faces are only getting tougher. At some point, Nvidia will fail to jump the bar that’s been set for its earnings and the stock will crash, right? Maybe not. Nvidia is continuing to pull out all the stops to stay ahead of its competitors and ensure that its earnings run at a blistering pace. In March, Nvidia unveiled its next generation AI microchips at a developer conference. Called the Blackwell series, the first of these new chips, the GB200, is the company’s most powerful technology to date. Specifically, the new GB200 chip includes what Nvidia calls a “transformer engine” that’s designed to run transformer based AI, one of the core technologies underpinning chatbots such as GPT-4. Nvidia is already receiving huge pre-orders from companies such as Microsoft and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). At the same time, Nvidia has signalled its intention to become less of a microchip provider and more of a platform provider going forward. To that end, the company introduced new revenue-generating software called Nvidia Inference Microservice (NIM) that it will charge a subscription fee for enterprise customers to access. And, Nvidia continues to expand globally, recently announcing plans to build a $200 million AI center in Indonesia as it grows throughout Asia. Nvidia currently controls about three-quarters (75%) of the AI chip market worldwide. That dominance shows no signs of decreasing. If anything, Nvidia’s market share is likely to increase as it begins to deliver its Blackwell series of microchips later this year. While the company’s earnings and stock have produced blockbuster gains over the last 18 months, there’s every reason to believe that the growth will continue. The bottom line is that Nvidia has the expertise and the products to remain the foundation of the AI revolution. For this reason, NVDA stock is a buy.

      "Cathie Wood-run Ark Investment Management on Monday sold more shares of AI stalwart Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) even as the market has factored in continued outperformance for the stock. Cashing Out Of AI Bigwigs: Ark through its ARK Autonomous Technology & Robotics ETF (CBOE: ARKQ) and ARK Genomic Revolution ETF (CBOE: ARKG) sold 4,422 Nvidia shares. At Monday’s closing price of $871.33, the sale would have fetched Ark $3.85 million. Following Monday’s sale, ARKG holds 7,139 Nvidia shares and ARKQ 20,724 shares. The Ark Fintech Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKF) and Ark Next Generation Internet ETF (NYSE:ARKW) currently have 12,711 and 20,464 Nvidia shares, respectively in their portfolio. Cumulatively, these exchange-traded funds hold 61,038 Nvidia shares, valued at $53.18 million. Ark’s flagship ETF – the Ark Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKK) fully divested Nvidia shares in January 2023 ahead of their AI-induced strong surge. Ark also shed some shares of another AI play on Monday. The ARK Space Exploration & Innovation ETF (CBOE: ARKX) sold 3,129 shares of Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) worth $488,562.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Many highly successful stock pickers, including Warren Buffett, often buy stocks on weakness.  That’s largely because companies that are great or are on their way to greatness often sink for reasons that are not at all justified. For example, on Feb. 21, Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) dropped to as low as $817.08 per share. Many investors wrung their hands about the stock’s valuation, even though it was not expensive, along with the firm’s decision to sell more shares of its stock. Of course, the latter decision ultimately did not greatly affect the company’s fundamentals. Anyone who bought the stock for just above $700 and sold it near its high of $1,033 on Mar. 28, a little over a month later, would have generated a profit of nearly 50% in a little over a month. So Buffett’s belief that investors should “be fearful when others are greedy and… be greedy only when others are fearful” does work. For those who want to profit from that philosophy, here are three stocks to buy on dips. Enphase Energy (NASDAQ:ENPH), which sells inverters used in solar energy projects,  tumbled over 10% on Apr. 5 compared to its highs on the previous day. The catalyst for the downturn was reportedly the decision by Chief Commercial Officer David Ranhoff leaving the firm “for personal reasons” effective Jun. 30.  But sometimes executives really do leave firms for personal reasons, and this may be the case for Ranhoof. Moreover, it’s unlikely that Enphase will badly be hurt by the departure of its chief commercial officer. The company probably has many highly capable sales managers who can adequately fill his shoes. And importantly, Nextracker (NASDAQ:NXT) CEO Dan Shugar said in February that “solar is unstoppable” and “the intrinsic economics of utility scale are phenomenal both in the U.S. and overseas. It has never been as favorable as it is.” Enphase is reeling from the weakness of residential solar in California due to regulatory changes in the state.  Also, excess inventories in Europe weigh on the stock. Those issues, though, are expected to be temporary. They should be dwarfed over the longer term by huge increases in the demand for solar energy by utilities. These increases will be driven, as I’ve noted in the past, by significant gains in electricity demand. By the end of this year, ENPH stock should be far above its current levels as a result of the latter trend. Consequently, ENPH is one of the best stocks to buy on dips. The market has penalized Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) stock after the firm announced on Apr. 2 after the market closed that its manufacturing unit’s operational losses increased to $7 billion last year from $5.2 billion in 2022. Further, the unit’s revenue declined 31% to $18.9 billion. In the wake of the admittedly discouraging news, INTC stock retreated about 15% from recent highs. But CEO Pat Gelsinger explained the firm was remedying bad decisions it had made previously that weighed down the manufacturing business. What’s more, Intel expects the unit’s operating losses to peak this year. Also noteworthy is that it predicted the unit will break even on an operating basis in 2027.  But the manufacturing unit’s backlog now exceeds $15 billion, and it secured a sizeable deal from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). There are also indications that INTC may soon obtain a meaningful commitment from Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). As a result, other tech firms impressed by Intel’s ability to win deals from two of the biggest names in the sector may sign contracts as well. I predict within the next 12 months the Street will start to be enamored with Intel again as the manufacturing unit’s backlog grows. Further, as I’ve previously noted, reviews of the company’s powerful artificial intelligence Gaudi chips have been quite favorable. The chips’ backlog reached over $2 billion by the end of last year. What’s more, the backlog is growing quite rapidly. Intel is expected to launch a greatly improved version of the chip later this year. American Superconductor (NASDAQ:AMSC) sells products used to regulate the flow of electricity. It serves multiple industries whose use of electricity or whose revenues are rapidly increasing. Specifically, AMSC has many customers that operate semiconductor plants, and the number of such factories is surging. The sector’s use of electricity is booming as AI proliferates rapidly. Similarly, the company has many customers in the mining and materials sector. That space is growing rapidly as metals prices jump and demand for their use in renewable energy products and electric vehicles rises.  The shares are down 13% from their March high of $15 and are changing hands at a forward price-sales ratio of three times.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Machine learning stocks are seeing a surge in interest in 2024 thanks to innovations like ChatGPT, which are making investors take notice of the impressive financial growth of Palantir (NYSE:PLTR), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD). All three outpace the rest of their sector in revenue and EPS growth in the next three to five years. The industry’s expansion will also help these machine learning stocks; by 2030, the sector will increase at a 17% annual rate (CAGR 2024-2030) and reach $528 billion. However, all the selections we examine will attract investors for different reasons. For example, Palantir is well-known for its ties to the U.S. Department of Defence; a recent $178.4 million transaction is an example. However, U.S. commercial revenues will surpass $640 million by 2024, giving it a dual focus. Meanwhile, Nvidia is driving today’s tech boom, primarily because over 85% of the market is cornered for generative AI. Lastly, although trailing Nvidia, AMD continues to gain attention because of innovations like its Ryzen 8040 Series CPUs and Instinct MI300X AI accelerator.  Palantir is one of the best machine learning stocks thanks to its strong ties with the U.S. Department of Defense. However, a strong dependence on government contracts usually leads to criticism from a certain section of investors. Usually, investors will read the latest earnings report only to see if the balance is shifting toward commercial. On that end, Palantir deserves credit for boosting the number of healthcare, energy, and finance clients. U.S. commercial revenue increased 70% to $131 million in Q4 2023. As a result of this growth, Palantir’s total U.S. commercial revenue for 2023 was $457 million. Palantir projects that its U.S. commercial sales will surpass $640 million in 2024, indicating a 40% growth rate from 2023. Palantir’s recent partnership with Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) is a good example of its ongoing commercial success. This agreement allows users to take advantage of Palantir’s Gotham and AI platforms while operating the Oracle cloud. Apart from its success in the commercial realm, Palantir continues to see healthy growth in terms of government contracts. The latest example is a $178.4 million deal to develop the next-generation targeting system, TITAN. Under this deal, ten TITAN prototypes—ground stations that link Army units to space and high-altitude sensors for targeting data—will be developed and manufactured. Nvidia is responsible for the 2024 tech stock boom; the stock is up 82% YTD. It controls more than 85% of the generative AI industry accelerators. The business’s yearly sales of AI chips are about $20 billion, highlighting its critical role in expanding AI-driven companies.  Owing to its AI chip dominance, Nvidia beat analyst estimates ten out of the last 12 times. A 588% increase in net income and a 206% increase in sales YOY in Q3 of fiscal 2024 is startling growth for a legacy company. The H100 processors added $37.5 billion to sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, becoming a key to its success, and my colleague Chris MacDonald says potential chip sales in the current year can net $93 billion if they make up the majority of chips sold. Nvidia’s strong order backlog from Indian companies demonstrates demand is not solely local. Many nations are seeking ways to circumvent U.S. export restrictions so they may purchase Nvidia processors, even if these restrictions are driving up the price of the company’s chips. Nvidia, though, is not resting on its laurels; the GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchip and GH200 Grace Hopper platform are good examples. The former will help reduce lags in AI workflows, and the latter will help develop faster AI models. AWS, Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure are already on the Blackwell-powered train. Meanwhile, top manufacturers expect systems running on the Grace Hopper Superchip in Q2 2024. Despite the stock reaching an all-time high of $950 earlier this year, analysts are projecting upside of 13%.  Nvidia holds the top spot in the AI chip industry, but perennial number two is also a good investment. Shares are up over 22%, but analysts suggest more upside for the Lisa Su-led company, 18% versus Friday’s close. The newly launched Instinct MI300 accelerators and Ryzen 8040 Series CPUs will have a big influence on sales growth; according to the most recent quarterly data, sales have increased 10% year over year, so there is definitely a need for a boost. Meanwhile, the Instinct MI300X, an AI accelerator processor, is predicted to help generate $2 billion in 2024 AI chip sales. Focusing on machine learning, AMD’s GPUs with the RDNA 3 architecture will simplify processes in this segment. Via the Microsoft DirectML API for Windows, the technology may be used with ONNX, PyTorch and TensorFlow. Developers can also use the platform with the AMD ROCm platform, Linux and Windows Nod.AI SHARK platform. Separately, AMD ROCm 6.0 is increasing the capability of AI and machine learning by supporting additional GPUs, including the Radeon PRO W7800 and Radeon RX 7900 GRE. Lastly, AMD earnings are to grow 34% in 2024 and 58% in 2025. Additionally, all investors will appreciate its debt reduction efforts, which shows sound financial management.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips It’s hard to believe we’re already a quarter of the way through 2024. So far, it’s been a solid year for equities, but the first week in April was the worst performance since October 2023. You’ve probably heard a lot of conversation about this being a “stock picker’s market.” That simply means you may have to work a little harder to find stocks to buy. One proven way to profit in a stock picker’s market is to look for stocks that are getting upgraded by analysts. This can be particularly true when the upgrades are supported by bullish movement in the stock. If you catch this run-up early enough, there’s still time to ride it higher. That’s the case for the three stocks in this article. They are from very different sectors. And the bullish case for each is not the same. But a case does exist, and that’s why you they could be stocks to buy or put on your watchlist as earnings season kicks off. The current super cycle in semiconductor stocks has many investors wondering what stock may be the next Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)? If you’re one of them, Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) is one to consider. The rapid rise of artificial intelligence applications is creating the need for high bandwidth memory (HBM).  Micron is a leader in the category and its new High Bandwidth Memory 3E (HBM3E) solution that launched in February sets up the company to continue to capture market share. This is especially true because the HBM3E chip will be embedded into Nvidia’s newest H200 graphic processing units (GPUs). In the last two quarters, Micron has turned around year-over year (YOY) declines on its top and bottom lines and even with MU stock moving over 111% higher in the last 12 months, it’s likely that the stock price doesn’t fully price in the strong earnings growth expected in the next 12 months. MU stock started to pull back around $128 per share. However, with 32 analysts giving the stock either a Strong Buy or Buy rating, any pullback is a buyable dip. The bullish case for making FedEx (NYSE:FDX) one of the second quarter stocks to buy boils down to controlling the controllables. The shipping company can’t do anything to stimulate consumer demand. The company is winding up its long-standing contract with the United States Postal Service (USPS) which is shifting its business to United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS). But it can manage costs. And investors saw evidence of that in the company’s March earnings report. The company had a slight miss on the top line, but it beat earnings expectations. And earnings were also higher YOY. At least 19 analysts have either reiterated their Buy (or equivalent) ratings or raised their price targets for FDX stock.  FedEx stock is up more than 9% in the last month with much of those gains coming since the earnings report. The stock has pulled back a little since the beginning of April, but this looks like a buyable dip. Analysts consensus price targets give the stock 14% upside and 18 out of 30 analysts have either a Strong Buy or Buy rating on FDX stock. Williams-Sonoma (NYSE:WSM) is a retail stock that also falls into the consumer discretionary category that has been beaten down in the last year. But Williams-Sonoma has been an outlier. WSM stock is up 164.5% in the last 12 months. But there’s reason to believe there’s still room for the stock to move higher. For starters, the company’s business model targets a more affluent demographic. Not only have these consumers continued to spend on their homes, but they’re also generally not as sensitive to inflation. That’s good for Williams-Sonoma’s operating margin which was 20.1% when the company reported earnings in March. WSM stock has received approximately 13 upgrades in the last 20 days. However, the stock has a consensus Hold rating. But if you take the long view, the stock is up more than 463% in the last five years. You also get a growing dividend with a very safe payout ratio of around 24%.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips The stock market rally continues, with last week’s jobs report sparking a rebound. And just a day after a steep slide, investors may wish to become just a bit more selective. Undoubtedly, AI is still the name of the game for many gain-hungry investors. The boom is unlikely over. Now, good economic data combines with potentially lower inflation and looming rate cuts. So, we may have an environment where it’ll be tough to stand in the way of the market’s momentum. Even if there’s plenty of runway for the AI stocks boom to continue, the nearer-term trajectory could prove rougher. Understandably, investors look to book profits and spread bets into lower-cost names that may be next AI home run. Let’s examine a trio of AI stocks that are too hot to buy at current prices.  Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) has arguably been the hottest AI stock of 2024, at least so far. Despite retreating more than 20% from its recent peak, SMCI stock remains up over 230% year to date (YTD). Indeed, the recent bear market flop is a tiny blip, even when looking at the YTD chart! True, new Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) AI chips, which SMCI is sure to adapt swiftly, act as a nice near-term catalyst.  But, I’m simply not comfortable pursuing SMCI stock, given the chart’s unappetizing appeal of recent weeks. With a potential head-and-shoulders technical formation that may very well be developing, I’m too scared to be a net buyer here and will stay glued to the sidelines. Shares remain quite frothy at 74.4 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E). Also, AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) shed around 20% of its value since peaking in early March. With more negative momentum this past month than NVDA, as well as a higher trailing P/E ratio, take a “raincheck” on AMD. And this is especially relevant if AI stocks are rocked further from here. Indeed, AMD is a wonderful number-two AI chip titan that cannot be dismissed. With CEO Lisa Su running the show, AMD may be empowered to become even better than most Magnificent Seven companies over the long run. However, in the near term, shares may remain at high risk of a steeper pullback.  Perhaps a better entry point will present itself for patient AI investors. AMD is working hard behind the scenes to maintain (or even advance) its lead in AI acceleration and a potential AI PC boom. In short, AMD’s a great business, but the price is a higher than desirable. Palantir (NASDAQ:PLTR) will likely perform well as the AI boom unfolds in the coming years. After the stock’s recent vertical spike, the big-data juggernaut may be at high risk of a near-term pullback. This is  especially true as AI enthusiasm temporarily fades, at least until the next big breakthrough. For long-term investors, any further weakness in PLTR stock may serve as a fantastic buying opportunity. With shares down more than 13%, the stock still doesn’t seem cheap enough. Consider that it is fresh off a six-day losing streak. Just last week, Wall Street analyst Brian White of Monness warned Palantir stock as valuation is excessive. With shares trading at more than 23.7 times price-to-sales, White could be right indeed.

      "Following KeyBanc Capital Markets‘ quarterly supply-chain findings, the firm’s semiconductor analyst John Vinh revisited his estimates for the chip stocks in his coverage universe. Mixed outlook: Supply-chain checks showed mixed results for the various segments within the semiconductor industry, said Vinh in a note released Monday. Analog saw “signs of life” within China and muted performance elsewhere, he said, adding that the first quarter will likely mark the bottom. The PC market is set to see roughly flattish performance for the year, the analyst said. In the smartphone market, iPhone demand weakened in China, while it was stronger in India, Vinh said. The analyst said iPhone shipments are still expected to remain largely flat at about 230 million units for the year as weaker iPhone 15 demand is being offset by stronger demand for legacy models, including the iPhone 12/14 in India and also in China. Also, high-end Android phone demand remained healthy, offsetting the potential weakness in the mid-and low-end market, he added.  Artificial intelligence-related demand remained robust, the analyst said. “AI remains robust as expected, despite plenty of cross-currents, while CoWoS capacity is expected to double in 2025,” he said. The analyst noted that server supply-chain feedback suggested a slight improvement in demand in the first quarter due to a meaningful improvement in the overall supply and lead times for Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) H100 GPUs. TSMC was looking to double its CoWoS capacity in 2025 to 600K interposers, while Nvidia was also planning to double its capacity at TSMC to 300K interposers, Vinh said. “This would suggest that generative AI semiconductor revenues are expected to more than double in 2025,” he said.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips The technology sector is generally responsible for innovation and growth. Thus, it’s no surprise that it often produces highly valued stocks. Companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) are great examples of the sector. Yet, there are plenty of underestimated tech stocks poised for a breakout. Once these bargain stocks break out they tend to create instant value for investors. Fortunately, there are relatively easy ways to identify shares with such potential. Value metrics are an extremely useful tool, but they are not the only factors investors should consider when hunting for bargains. Thematic direction of markets and how a given stock fits such narratives should also be examined. Let’s take a look at three underestimated stocks poised for a breakout. Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) has undertaken an effort to rejuvenate its business and make it stronger in relation to recurring revenues. That’s the thrust of the logic behind its recent acquisition of Splunk.  The deal is expected to add $4.2 billion in annual recurring revenues to Cisco Systems. CSCO itself reported $25 billion in annual recurring revenues in the most recent year. The acquisition will better align Cisco Systems with the analytics and cyber security markets overall. That should be a boon to CSCO shares, which are generally viewed as a more conservative choice overall. Part of the reason Cisco Systems has undertaken such a transition is related to declining earnings and revenue in the most recent quarter. CSCO stock is a bargain based on its P/E ratio. It’s reasonable to anticipate that ratio will rise as more attractive software earnings enter the mix following the Splunk acquisition. Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is often one of the first stocks discussed when it comes to the confluence of tech and income. The chip manufacturer’s shares include a dividend yielding roughly 2%. Furthermore, Qualcomm is undervalued when it comes to price to free cash flow ratio. QCOM’s strong free cash flow implies several things. First of all, Qualcomm’s ability to produce such cash flows is particularly beneficial given that it does pay dividends. Further, it also suggests that the company has the cash on hand to operate after everything else is done. That allows the company the latitude to do as it pleases.  The point here is that Qualcomm’s cash position gives it the ability to seek growth. That means the company is one of a few that provides income and growth opportunities to investors. Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) is undervalued for the simple fact that it is making a push to provide for Nvidia. The company recently began mass production of high bandwidth memory chips for use in Nvidia’s most up-to-date AI chips. The South Korean firm’s rivals Samsung and SK Hynix have decided to work together to address Micron’s challenge. That admission was highly unprecedented and speaks to their fear Micron will establish an insurmountable early lead. Micron is ahead of both South Korean firms in terms of production and is in position to become an integral supplier to Nvidia. MU has a technological advantage over Samsung that could prove particularly beneficial. Micron is also better positioned from the perspective that it is a U.S. company. Firms located in the US will have an easier time in the lead up to the presidential election. for all of those reasons Micron is underestimated.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips The world is a different, and better, place because of semiconductors. These little devices have become vital to everyday life in the 21st century. That’s why it’s a good idea to consider semiconductor stocks to buy in April. Semiconductors are tiny but powerful. They play an important role in powering smartphones, laptop computers, vehicles, and medical equipment. Semiconductors are responsible for the sophisticated electronic equipment that we use every day. Semiconductors are also becoming more powerful, allowing companies to develop applications that use artificial intelligence, machine learning, and the Internet of Things. Generative AI has become one of the biggest growth drivers for tech companies over the last year, making its advances possible by semiconductors. We’re using the Portfolio Grader today to look for A-rated and B-rated semiconductor stocks that you can buy in April to capitalize on this trend. The names on this list stand out because of their growth, earnings performance and momentum.  They represent the best opportunities for anyone looking for semiconductor stocks to buy in April, and to capitalize on the backbone of the digital revolution. Any examination of the best semiconductor stocks to buy in April has to start with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). The company’s stock rocketed 239% higher in 2023 and is well on its way to matching that gain in 2024. Nvidia is dominating the market because of its enormous position in generative AI. It manufactures roughly 90% of the most powerful graphics processing units used in generative AI applications. And now its rolling out its Blackwell GPUs, which will allow organizations to run real-time generative AI with trillion-parameter large language models at 25 times less cost and energy consumption. Look for the biggest tech companies in the world to incorporate the Blackwell chip into their designs, and for profits to continue to flow for Nvidia. NVDA stock is up 73% so far in 2024 and gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.  Semiconductor manufacturer Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) makes chips used in data centers, networking, software, storage, wireless and industrial applications. Broadcom products power Ethernet switching and routing silicon products, controllers and transceivers. Perhaps the most exciting thing for Broadcom, however, is its acquisition of VMware, which allows it to capitalize on VMware’s hybrid cloud platform. The platform provides large corporate customers with the power of a cloud network with on-premise data centers, and uses Nvidia GPUs to allow its customers to run AI models on-site. While Broadcom has a heavy reliance on mobile chip customers, I like the moves it is making to expand into infrastructure software. Broadcom expects roughly half of its revenue to be from this category in 2024, and I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s the biggest growth opportunity for AVGO moving forward. AVGO stock is up 18% in 2024 and gets a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.  Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has long been a top competitor to Nvidia, but it was left behind by Nvidia’s massive gains in 2023. And AMD faced a fresh challenge in recent weeks when it was announced that China plans to phase out the use of AMD chips in its government PCs and servers. That helped push AMD stock from more than $200 per share just a month ago to around $165 today. But I think there are brighter days ahead, and the bull thesis continues to hold for AMD. AMD’s Mi300 GPU accelerator is expected to generate $3.5 billion in revenue this year as an alternative to NVDA chips. AMD also has a huge opportunity to provide AI-PC chips for AI-compatible central processing units for the personal computer market. AMD reported fourth-quarter revenue of $6.1 billion, up 10% from a year ago. Earnings were $667 million and 41 cents per share, an improvement from $21 million and 1 cent per share in the same quarter of 2022.  AMD stock is attractive here on the dip. It gets a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader. Whether you think it’s Nvidia, AMD or another company that will be the dominant force in providing Big Tech with the best semiconductors, it remains a smart bet to invest in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM). The company, commonly known as TSMC, is the biggest chip manufacturer in the world, responsible for more than half of all contract chip manufacturing. And when it comes to making the most powerful chips on the planet, TSMC has roughly a 90% market share. Nvidia, AMD and Broadcom all rely on TSMC to make their semiconductors. So, if you are betting on any or all of those companies, you’re also banking on TSMC to realize profits. TSMC issued guidance for first-quarter revenue between $18 billion and $18.8 billion, with strong demand for high-performing chips. If it can top those numbers when it issues its report, you can expect TSM stock to jump.  TSM is up 34% so far in 2024 and gets a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader. Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) is a semiconductor manufacturing company headquartered in Boise, Idaho. The company makes products for memory and storage technologies, including DRAM, NAND and NOR technology. DRAM chips are used in every computing system, and AI systems require a lot of high-speed DRAM capacity. “We believe Micron is one of the biggest beneficiaries in the semiconductor industry of the multi-year opportunity enabled by AI,” CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said. Micron posted its biggest sales gain in 12 years after posting guidance for the fiscal third quarter of $6.4 billion to $6.8 billion, far exceeding analysts’ consensus estimates for $5.99 billion. That comes on the heels of Micron reporting fiscal Q2 revenue of $5.82 billion, an increase from $3.69 billion just a year ago. Income of $476 million and 42 cents per share improved from a loss of  $2.08 billion and $1.91 per share in fiscal Q2 2023. MU stock is up 45% in 2024 and gets a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.  Photronics (NASDAQ:PLAB) is another way to play the semiconductor space without investing in an actual semiconductor manufacturer. Instead, you can invest in a company that makes products that work with semiconductors. That’s where we get with Photronics, a Connecticut company that makes semiconductor photomasks. These are opaque plates with transparent areas that allow light to shine through in specific patterns on semiconductors. The market for semiconductor photomasks is estimated at $4 billion. Photronics earned $892.1 million in revenue for 2023 and $216.3 million for the first fiscal quarter of 2024, so there’s plenty of runway for this company. PLAB stock is down 11% so far in 2024 but registered a 77% gain in the last 12 months. It gets a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader. QuickLogic (NASDAQ:QUIK) makes low-power, multi-core semiconductor platforms and software. Its products are used in industrial, aerospace, defense, consumer, computing and AI applications.  QuickLogic also has an interesting subsidiary, SensiML, which makes AI and machine learning software. Its products are used in mobile devices used by medical professionals and industrial workers. The company is growing fast. Fourth-quarter revenue was $7.47 million, up from $4.08 million in the same period last year. The company posted a profit of $2.04 million and 15 cents per share a year after losing $1.23 million and 9 cents per share. QUIK stock is up 7% this year and 149% in the last 12 months. It gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader. On the date of publication, Louis Navellier and InvestorPlace Research Staff member primarily responsible for this article had long positions in NVDA.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Still considered as an underdog in x86 CPUs and discrete GPUs, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock clearly shows it’s ready to compete in the AI chip sector with lower prices. Despite drawing more power, its older designs are cost-effective. While expanding into data centers, AMD relies heavily on PC and gaming console sales. In 2023, revenue fell 4%, margins tightened, and EPS dropped 24%. While 2023’s slowdown disappointed, analysts project AMD’s revenue and adjusted EPS to surge by 14% and 37% in 2024. This growth hinges on stable PC sales and the launch of its cost-effective Instinct GPUs for AI applications. However, despite these prospects, AMD’s stock trades at 57-times forward earnings and 12-times sales, indicating high expectations.  Asus’s recent BIOS release hints at the imminent arrival of AMD’s Zen 5 processors. The news, highlighted by hardware leaker HXL, suggests a closer release timeline than anticipated. This progress in BIOS support suggests advanced development stages for Zen 5 CPUs. With cautious optimism, the firmware update hints at the nearing arrival of Zen 5 CPUs. Notably, it supports up to 256GB of DDR5 RAM. However, being in beta with significant changes, most users should avoid it. AMD confirmed Zen 5’s release in the second half of 2024, potentially debuting in Q3. Contradictory reports suggest Zen 5’s mass production might be delayed until Q3 or Q4. Despite this uncertainty, Asus’s progress signifies advancement. Anticipated reveals during Computex in June may include next-gen Ryzen CPUs. Intel’s (NASDAQ:INTC) potential delay with Arrow Lake processors until late 2024 or early 2025 could pose challenges against Zen 5. AMD followed Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) lead in recent months, though its stock price has lagged. AMD stock is up a respectable 20% year-to-date. However, Nvidia is up around 80% over this time frame, after more than tripling last year. It’s an incredible race, but one in which AMD seems to be losing ground, despite strong performance. Much of this has to do with Nvidia’s recent AI chip announcements, with its Blackwell GPU set to take even more market share on the very high-end corner of the market. AMD’s options are much less powerful, and despite more attractive price tags, could lag in the overall market until it introduces better technology to compete int his realm.  That said, putting AMD’s rise over the past decade in context is important. Under CEO Lisa Su, AMD stock has gained over 6,300% since 2014. The rise of generative AI extends beyond servers to PCs and phones, demanding powerful CPUs and GPUs. This shift sparks competition between AMD, Intel, Samsung, ARM Holdings, Apple, and Microsoft, especially in GPU design. AMD’s sales doubled this decade, but profits fluctuated, dropping over two-thirds from their 2021 peak in 2023. Analysts forecast AMD’s net income to exceed $5 per share in fiscal 2025, with some predicting over $8.30. With a forward P/E ratio under 22, the outlook is favorable, especially amid the ongoing AI PC boom. While AMD stock faces stiff competition from Intel and Nvidia, its growth trajectory remains promising under CEO Lisa Su’s leadership. Su’s performance warrants optimism, given AMD’s transformation from a $3 stock to a competitive force in the market. After the release of ChatGPT, AI’s potential became limitless for many sectors. From healthcare down to finance, AI is inevitable and has sparked a wave of advanced research and development. This surge underscores the need to address limitations in current infrastructure, primarily built around CPUs, which struggle to handle complex AI tasks efficiently. Enterprises and cloud providers like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure and Google Cloud have shifted focus to energy-efficient servers, favoring Nvidia’s GPUs for AI tasks.  AMD stock anticipates similar gains with its MI300x. Deloitte projects generative AI chips to exceed $50 billion in 2024, with Nvidia and AMD eyeing lucrative growth prospects, estimating a market worth hundreds of billions. CEO Lisa Su expects AMD’s next-gen AI chips to generate $3.5 billion in sales in 2024, projecting a market value of $45 billion by then, growing to $400 billion by 2027.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Semiconductor and AI behemoth Nvidia stock (NASDAQ:NVDA) isn’t even close to being done innovating with its core product and services portfolio. The maker of high-performance chips and AI-related software is seeing record demand, bolstering its top- and bottom-line growth metrics, and delivering whopping returns for investors. The stock more than tripled last year, and is already up roughly 80% this year. That’s the kind of growth compounding most investors would like to see over the course of decades in a given position. Indeed, Nvidia has provided that kind of growth – the kind where one decade’s worth of innovation and growth can happen in a given year. The artificial intelligence boom is for real, and Nvidia stock remains the way to play this trend. Here’s why I think this company could be worth paying up for, particularly on dips moving forward. Nvidia recently introduced the Blackwell platform at its GTC conference, revolutionizing computing with real-time generative AI at a fraction of the cost and energy usage. Featuring six cutting-edge technologies, Blackwell unlocks advancements in various industries, from data processing to quantum computing. CEO Jensen Huang sees Blackwell as pivotal for AI’s widespread adoption, with major companies like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) expected to embrace it.  Blackwell introduces six groundbreaking technologies, facilitating AI training and real-time inference for models with up to 10 trillion parameters. It boasts the world’s most powerful chip, with 208 billion transistors and a custom-built 4NP TSMC process, connecting GPU dies via 10 TB/second chip-to-chip links. The Second-Generation Transformer Engine doubles compute and model sizes, supporting 4-bit floating point AI inference. Additionally, the company’s Fifth-Generation NVLink offers 1.8TB/s bidirectional throughput per GPU for seamless communication among up to 576 GPUs. Blackwell’s RAS Engine ensures reliability, availability, and serviceability, while Secure AI safeguards models and data with advanced confidential computing capabilities. Lastly, a dedicated decompression engine accelerates data analytics and science, enhancing performance in GPU-accelerated data processing. Before the conference, Truist analyst William Stein boosted Nvidia’s price target from $911 to $1,177, anticipating heightened chip demand in 2024 and 2025. Additionally, HSBC analysts upped their price target from $880 to $1,050, maintaining a buy rating. Bank of America analysts revised their price target to $1,100 from $925. Post-conference, UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri upgraded Nvidia’s target price to $1,100 from $800, affirming a buy rating. Arcuri suggested that with Blackwell’s launch, Nvidia could tap into new global enterprise and sovereign demand.  Nvidia’s data center revenue reached $47.5 billion in 2024, with expectations to even reach a bigger number in the years to come. Analysts also anticipate to see the company hit a $300 billion revenue three years from now. With the upcoming B200 Blackwell chip promising enhanced capabilities at competitive pricing, Wall Street firms have raised Nvidia’s price targets accordingly. Nvidia stock unveiled plans for new AI GPUs based on its cutting-edge Blackwell architecture in 2024. These chips promise substantial performance boosts with lower power consumption. Nvidia anticipates widespread adoption by cloud computing providers and aims to expand its presence in the $250 billion GPU market. If Nvidia achieves a discounted 50-times earnings multiple, and reaches $25 per share in earnings, its stock price could surge to $1,250, marking a 33% jump from present levels. This projection surpasses the Street’s highest price target. Moreover, Nvidia might see even more significant gains if the market values it with a higher earnings multiple due to its exceptional growth.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Despite the huge gains of Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) stock over the past year, I continue to remain bullish on the firm’s shares. Among the reasons for my continued optimism are the company’s impressive partnerships and the low chances that its allies would look to switch to other partners anytime soon. Moreover, Super Micro Computer stock has an important technological advantage over its competitors and reports that it is continuing to innovate in order to stay ahead of the rest of the pack. Finally, given the high likelihood of AI continuing to proliferate rapidly for many years, SMCI will probably deliver very strong growth over the long term,, while the valuation of Super Micro Computer stock remains quite attractive. Super Micro partners closely with leading AI chip makers Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), AMD (NASDAQ:AMD), and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). As a result, Moreover, Super Micro Computer stock is able to get early access to the AI chips from these firms and make modifications to its servers which work in tandem with the semiconductors  before its competitors can similarly alter their offerings. JPMorgan, in a recent note to investors, identified this advantage as an important edge for SMCI. What’s more, the bank views Super Micro’s close geographical proximity to both Nvidia and AMD (all three firms are located in Northern California) as an important edge for the server maker. Intel’s headquarters are also in the same region.  Nvidia, AMD, and Intel are all used to working with Super Micro and all three of SMCI’s partners are conveniently located very close to it, while switching to other partners would cost the chip makers significant amounts of time and money. Consequently, I don’t expect SMCI’s collaborators to abandon it in the foreseeable future. On the technological front, Super Micro is a leader in using liquid cooling equipment to reduce the temperature of its products. Data centers’ equipment becomes quite hot when producing and powering AI systems, and a great deal of power must be used in order to cool the equipment with air conditioning. Consequently, SMCI’s liquid cooling offering saves data centers significant amounts of money. Since electricity prices will probably rise meaningfully over the longer term in the U.S. due to increasing demand for the product, the company’s liquid cooling system will become even more valuable in the coming years. And importantly, Super Micro is continuing to develop new liquid-cooling options in order to stay ahead of the competition. Last September, CEO Charles Liang reported that it  was “developing products that deliver (liquid cooling) at system, rack, and datacenter scale.” Super Micro’s products are essential for creating and powering AI systems, while the demand for AI is expected to grow rapidly over a long period of time. Indeed, Statista anticipates that the global AI market will soar from about $200 billion last year to more than $1.8 trillion by 2030. Given these points, SMCI is very well-positioned to continue to expand tremendously for the foreseeable future. Meanwhile, Wall Street analysts are quite bullish on the company’s short-term growth outlook. On average, they expect its sales to soar 106% this year before climbing another 42% in 2025. Given the high likelihood that AI will continue proliferating very quickly next year, I think that the analysts’ 2025 outlook for SMCI will prove to be overly conservative.  And given Super Micro’s very impressive growth ,the valuation of Super Micro Computer stock is rather low. The firm’s forward price-earnings ratio of 30.8 times is quite small for a company that is expanding so rapidly and is in a sector with huge amounts of potential.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips The crypto sector has been on a tear, propelled higher by none other than the leading digital asset, Bitcoin (BTC-USD). Its rise has proliferated into other digital assets, with many investors in this space focusing on cryptos alone. So, within this sector, two key catalysts could drive greater upside over the near-term. They both have to do with Bitcoin. First is the upcoming halving event, set to take place in a couple weeks. And the second is the impact spot ETFs will have on the entire sector. As more money flows into this space, and Bitcoin’s price rises following its halving, other related companies should benefit. Some publicly-traded companies do well when crypto does well. Much focus now is shifted to spot Bitcoin ETFs (which can be bought and sold on the markets just as stocks are). However, a valuation gap may be coming into play. Therefore, let’s dive into three crypto stocks to benefit most from a possible vicious rally higher for the rest of the year.  Showing up as the top blockchain stock worldwide, Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) remains a top option for equity investors. It provides the critical infrastructure to support the largest centralized exchange in the U.S. Despite legal and regulatory challenges, Coinbase is still the top player in its industry. As such, when the SEC did approve spot Bitcoin ETFs, Coinbase took over handling the back-end functionality for most of the companies that successfully received approvals from regulators. Notably, analysts have been upgrading the stock in recent weeks. Kyle Voigt, an analyst from KBW, expressed their impressions on COIN as it has showed unique exposure in the crypto economy. This analyst raised his price target to $230 from $160, while maintaining a market performance rating, noting potential revenue growth from increased USD Coin balances and rising crypto asset levels. Currently, COIN stock trades around $250 per share, so there’s still downside baked into this target. But it’s a significant raise, nonetheless. In the first quarter, outstanding USDC balances surged by 32%, per reports. USDC, a stablecoin issued by Circle and backed by Coinbase, contributes to the crypto exchange’s gross interest income, generating about 56% of this key metric. Additionally, March saw a spike in average daily trading volume to $5.1 billion, compared to $2.4 billion in February, driving momentum for the stock. If more capital continues to flow into the crypto sector, it’s likely to come through Coinbase, at least in the U.S. Accordingly, the thesis is very simple with this crypto stock.  Marathon Digital (NASDAQ:MARA) is among the largest Bitcoin miners in the world, making it deserving of a spot on this list. Recent bearish sentiment around the upcoming Bitcoin halving has led to selling pressure for MARA stock. That makes sense, since the company’s revenue (at least in terms of Bitcoin mined) will halve overnight. But for those bullish on Bitcoin’s price rising materially following its halving, this is a stock to consider. Recent innovations like MARAFW firmware and MARA UCB 2100 control board aim to optimize mining rigs, enhancing operational efficiency. Additionally, the company’s MARA 2PIC700 cooling system promises higher power density. So this will enable robust expansion despite the halving’s impact. Also, Marathon Digital’s Bitcoin production and revenue demonstrate the pivotal role of mining output in its performance assessment. With expanded operations and hash rate, MARA should benefit from rising Bitcoin prices over time. Of course, a Bitcoin price at least 50% above current levels will likely be needed to spark another major rally in this miner. But for those who think that’s possible, buying now may be a decent strategy. During this year’s crypto surge, MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) known for its substantial Bitcoin holdings, saw its market cap surpass that of almost half the S&P 500 companies. MicroStrategy’s stock surged 204% in 2024, reaching $1,919 by Wednesday’s close. Contrast this to Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) 82% year-to-date (YTD) increase.  Having initially invested in Bitcoin as an inflation safeguard in August 2020, MicroStrategy continuously accumulated Bitcoin. Today, the company holds a total of 214,246 BTC, becoming the leading corporate holder of this digital asset. While opinions vary on MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin accumulation strategy, it remains a notable aspect of its operations. MicroStrategy’s substantial Bitcoin holdings were acquired at an average of $33,706 per Bitcoin. Now, they are valued at $65,000 each. This greatly influences its trajectory. With Bitcoin holdings valued at around $14 billion, this business now vastly overshadows MicroStrategy’s business intelligence segment, providing significant leverage for the future. Predictions of Bitcoin surpassing $100,000 by next year underscore its enduring value.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Editor’s Note: This. article was previously published under the name “Investing in the Next Wave of Explosive AI Growth” in February 2024. It has since been updated to reflect the most recent data. So far this year, the world’s leading AI chipmaker – Nvidia (NVDA) – has made it abundantly clear that the AI Boom is here. And the party’s just getting started. The tech firm reported in February that its revenues rose more than 260% in the last quarter of 2023. And management also said that revenues will rise another 230% this quarter, too. That’s got the mainstream media and most investors obsessing over Nvidia’s hyperbolic growth.  Then, in March, the company kicked off its GPU Technology Conference (GTC) with a keynote speech from CEO Jensen Huang. Huang headlined his keynote speech with the launch of Blackwell — Nvidia’s next-gen chip architecture that will enable the creation of faster, smaller, and better AI chips. Meanwhile, the most important players in this industry – including Nvidia itself – have already moved on to the next big thing: something we’re calling AI 2.0. We’ve been following these developments for a while now. We’re confident it will be the next wave of major AI growth. And it seems it’s just now hitting its major inflection point. In fact, we just learned that Nvidia itself is betting big on this next iteration. And it isn’t alone.  Microsoft (MSFT) – the world’s largest AI company – is betting big on AI 2.0, too. So are OpenAI, the world’s most influential AI startup, Amazon (AMZN), Tesla (TSLA) and Samsung. Not to mention the world’s richest men, Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos. Right now, all are pouring millions of dollars into AI 2.0. That means it’s time for you to join in and bet alongside them. So, what exactly is AI 2.0?  The real-world application of AI technologies via humanoid robots. Yes, I’m talking about AI-powered robots like the ones you’ve seen in science-fiction movies like “iRobot.” This application may seem like a pie-in-the-sky dream. But humanoid robots are already in development. This new AI wave is here. Don’t believe me? Well, Nvidia also recently announced the introduction of the Project GROOT Foundation AI model, designed to enhance the performance of humanoid robots, alongside a new system-on-a-chip named Thor for robotic use. This move comes as notable companies such as OpenAI, Microsoft (MSFT), Tesla (TSLA) (more on that in a moment), Amazon (AMZN), and Intel (INTC) heavily invest in humanoid robot development. With Nvidia joining the fray, the advent of sophisticated robots appears imminent. And we’re head over heels for this compelling investment opportunity in AI robotics.  In fact, as I write, Tesla is busy developing a humanoid robot called Optimus. And already, it can do things like fold clothes, make eggs, exercise, and dance. Tesla sees a world in the not-too-distant future where these robots are everywhere, helping people all across the globe complete menial tasks like cooking, cleaning, organizing, and more. Elon Musk is even on record saying that in time, Optimus could be bigger than Tesla’s core vehicle business. And we don’t think he’s delusional. If he is, then it seems Jeff Bezos must be, too. The former Amazon founder and CEO is reportedly pouring $100 million into a humanoid robot startup called FigureAI.  Clearly, he sees a bright future for humanoid robots as well. And guess who else is investing in FigureAI? Bezos’ old company, Amazon. The titan is pouring $50 million into FigureAI. So is Microsoft, with a $95 million commitment to the startup – not to mention $50 million from Nvidia, too. Or how about OpenAI? The ChatGPT creator is already FigureAI’s biggest investor, and it’s throwing another $5 million into the firm. Plus, Intel (INTC) and Samsung are also reportedly investing in FigureAI right now as well. Folks, it seems the writing is on the wall.  You may think of AI-powered humanoid robots as a mere sci-fi concept. But as with the world’s most powerful people, the foremost AI innovators clearly think humanoid robots are the next frontier, too. They see them as AI 2.0. And they’re dedicating millions of dollars to create this tech right now. We believe we’re seeing this boom’s next evolution unfold right now. And that means it’s time to grab your slice of the pie. Find out how to do just that right now with a few of our favorite stock picks.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips This April, investors continue to chase after record-high growth stocks. While many of these companies offer pathways to wealth, many may be hurt by a coming economic shock. Thus, picking the right growth stocks to own before the Fed rate cut is important. Focus on growth stocks with solid fundamentals and skilled management teams. These companies promise substantial long-term returns despite occasional setbacks. Diversification and strategic placement can maximize wealth accumulation opportunities in portfolios. Here are three of the best stocks to buy as the Federal Reserve potentially steps back from its tight monetary policy stance and begins cutting. Baird recently upgraded Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) to outperform and raised their price target to $87. This upgrade was driven by positive operational trends, with Shopify showing steady growth in net active stores. This growth was notably seen in strategic sectors like Shopify Plus and international markets, bolstering the company’s long-term outlook. Indeed, I agree with the analysts that these segments will play a vital role in Shopify’s business strategy moving forward.  The firm’s revised e-commerce platform survey aligns with the company’s focus, prompting the price target adjustment. Analysts noted stable market conditions with revenue estimates slightly above consensus but profitability lagging. Shopify boasts a market cap of $96 billion, affirming its top e-commerce platform provider dominance. Despite a high price-earnings and price-sales multiple relative to previous results, investors are pricing in much better forward numbers. The company’s recent revenue growth of more than 26% and solid bottom-line growth support such a view. As the star of video conferencing during the pandemic, Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM) still wows the public with its AI innovations. Its most recent AI integration is the Zoom Workplace, an AI collaboration platform that helps workforces enhance teamwork. The launch includes features like Ask AI Companion, a refreshed app interface, and improvements to the Zoom Contact Center for improved customer engagement. Smita Hashim, Zoom’s product chief, emphasized the significant benefits of Zoom AI Companion in enhancing collaborative workflows. Introducing Zoom Workplace with AI Companion aims to address user needs by integrating core collaboration tools into a unified AI-powered platform, improving productivity and efficiency. The latest AI Companion features, including Ask AI Companion and Zoom Phone and Team Chat enhancements, offer added value at no extra cost. Following pressure from European regulators, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) announced a division of its Teams and Office bundles on Monday, relieving competitors. Despite struggles against Microsoft’s communication suite, Zoom saw its video chat app soar during the pandemic. Mizuho analysts suggest separating MS Teams may ease enterprise churn, recommending buying Zoom shares.  This past year was one of the best for semiconductor giant Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). The company saw excellent growth, leading to a stock price that surged 259%. The main catalyst behind this rise? A surge of interest in artificial intelligence and related companies. As the key purveyor of high-performance chips used by AI companies and those developing applications, Nvidia has absolutely been on a rocket ship higher. This year alone, the stock is up roughly 80%, signaling just how powerful investors see this company’s future earnings coming in. At its recent GTC conference, Nvidia unveiled its Blackwell chip, ushering in a new computing era. The architecture offers six transformative technologies, enabling real-time generative AI at significantly lower costs and energy usage. CEO Jensen Huang sees Blackwell as pivotal for industries like deep learning and quantum computing, driving AI’s widespread adoption. Aside from the tech sector, Nvidia has expanded into healthcare by collaborating with the startup Hippocratic AI. Hippocratic AI develops virtual agents using Nvidia’s technology to streamline patient care tasks like appointment scheduling and post-discharge follow-ups. Leveraging Nvidia’s Avatar Cloud and NIM microservices, Hippocratic AI aims to enhance its health-focused large language model. For those looking for AI exposure, Nvidia remains the best option in this space. And while its stock isn’t cheap, on a forward basis, its valuation isn’t insane either. This stock remains a buy until the company shows its growth is slowing.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) recorded more than 220% returns in the last twelve months, mainly due to the AI explosion. The company’s upward trajectory could be running out of steam. High-profile investors are starting to cash out. The company’s old rivals, like Intel, are also starting to produce AI chips. The then-GPU maker is now facing significant competition as everyone wants a piece of the market. And it will only get tighter going forward. This is why some investors seek stocks offering better growth than Nvidia. So with a market brimming with tech companies touting AI-adjacent products and services, how can one make a decent pick? I think it’s wiser to look into companies with tried-and-tested formulas or ones that present a compelling picture of their future, like these three. First, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has come a long way and become a tech powerhouse. It’s mostly known as the alternative to Nvidia in the GPU market and Intel in the CPU market.The company’s operation data center segment oversees its key products. Those include its server CPUs, AI accelerators, graphic processing units and accelerated processing units.  Also, AMD’s latest Instict MI300X GPUs are seeing market exposure. Late last year, Microsoft announced that it would use the chip for its accelerated virtual machines. This can be another growth avenue for AMD. Meanwhile, 2023 was a slight off-year for the company. Full-year revenue and gross profit decreased 4% and 1%, respectively. Fiscal year 2024 predictions also remain flat to negative, which might not incite much confidence from investors. Additionally, AMD is playing catch-up with Intel and Nvidia regarding market share for CPUs and GPUs/data centers. However, the company is no stranger to this position. It has repeatedly demonstrated the ability to recover with significant market share boosts. Ryzen’s launch is a testament to that, boosting AMD CPU coverage from the low 20s to nearly 40% in half a decade. On the AI front, the company is expanding its offerings, including announcing the Ryzen 8040 Series mobile CPU and the Ryzen 8000G Series for desktops. Both are integrated with neural processing units for AI workload acceleration. While most investors wouldn’t see it winning head-to-head with Nvidia right now, its promise for growth is a different story.  GPU and CPU chips aren’t the only things in demand. External memory chips are also crucial, especially for larger neural networks. Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) is tackling the AI boom with its high-performance memory products and is a leader in memory and storage solutions. Its HBM3E memory helps accelerate the growth of AI with its lightning-fast data access of 1.2 terabytes per second bandwidth. It operates at a 30% lower power consumption than other competitive offerings. HB3ME is so good that it has sold out its supply for 2024 and most of its 2025 supply, signifying its product’s superiority to its market competition. Further, the company’s products were so well received that it reached revenue of $5.82 billion for Q2 of 2024. That is significantly higher than its $3.69 billion for the same year-ago quarter. GAAP net income ended at $793 million, a turnaround from its previous year’s GAAP net loss of $2.31 billion. “Micron delivered fiscal Q2 results with revenue, gross margin and EPS well above the high-end of our guidance range — a testament to our team’s excellent execution on pricing, products and operations,” said Sanjay Mehrotra, President and CEO. Finally, MU anticipates continued growth, driven by the demand for AI and tight supply dynamics in the semiconductor industry. The company is still on the road to recovery after its massive ban from China last year. So, if you are in the market for stocks offering better growth prospects than Nvidia, this is it.  Mostly known as Supermicro, Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) is a high-performance server specialist that offers application-optimized servers and storage systems for various enterprises. While the company may not be as big as Dell Technologies and Hewlett Packard Enterprise on a global scale, it is uniquely positioned due to its long-standing partnership with Nvidia for its dedicated AI servers and the wave it brings in the growing trend. While some may think that Supermicro is riding the coattails of the GPU giant, I certainly disagree. Its application-optimized servers and Nvidia GPUs help pre-trained models fine-tune and improve decision-making and response times for AI inference solutions. This was a strong combination, as its latest quarterly financials reported a 103% year over year (YOY) growth in net sales, which amounted to $3.66 billion. Also, SMCI’s net income reached $296 million, nearly double that of the previous year. CEO Charles Liang attributes the company’s exceptional performance to the increasing demand for its AI computer platforms and Total IT Solutions.  In terms of outlook, SMCI expects revenue for fiscal year 2024 to be between $14.3 billion and $14.7 billion, adjusted higher from the previous announcement. With its strong growth and robust AI product offerings, it’s no wonder investors view SMCI as one of the stocks offering better growth than Nvidia.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips The Magnificent Seven stocks make up a large portion of the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100. The performances of these seven stocks can potentially make or break the stock market. While the Magnificent Seven is a relatively new name, the group is quite familiar. Investors may remember hearing about FANG and FAANG stocks for several years. Most of the stocks that made up FAANG are members of the Magnificent Seven. Corporations change over time and impact long-term investors. Some businesses that once achieved impressive growth rates aren’t living up to the Magnificent Seven stock club. However, these three giants are still delivering solid returns for investors, and it looks like they have more room to climb. Here are the best Magnificent 7 stocks to buy in April. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is becoming the largest artificial intelligence (AI) stock, in addition to Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). While Nvidia produces the chips, Microsoft has made acquisitions and investments left and right. The company is even making moves that resemble acquisitions to avoid regulators.  Microsoft isn’t only expanding through AI. The company also acquired Activision to strengthen its video game segment, which features Xbox. Gaming has been a benefactor for Microsoft, but the company makes most of its money from cloud computing. Microsoft Cloud revenue grew by 24% year-over-year (YoY)  in Q2 FY24. The segment generated $33.7 billion of the company’s $62.0 billion in revenue for the quarter. Microsoft’s overall business delivered an 18% YoY increase in revenue. Net income jumped by 33% YoY, bringing profit margins to 35.3% in the process. Microsoft is the largest publicly traded corporation and has exceptional long-term returns. The stock is up 245% over the past five years and has already gained 12% year-to-date. Nvidia has been another top-performing stock that looks like it can extend its rally. The company’s GPU chips continue to gain market share and have given the company a comfortable lead over its competitors. It’s hard to recall a time when a mega-cap corporation exhibited the same financial growth that Nvidia currently enjoys. The AI giant reported 265% YoY revenue growth and 769% YoY net income growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024.  AI spending will eventually slow down, but Nvidia is still likely to grow at a respectable rate in the years ahead. Investors shouldn’t expect triple-digit growth rates to last much longer. The stock currently trades at a 36-forward P/E ratio and is up 74% year-to-date. Profit margins have expanded dramatically since the AI boom. The company reported a 55.6% net profit margin to close out the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. Revenue and earnings growth rates from that quarter have outpaced the stock’s gains over the past year. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) has built the world’s largest online advertising network. Many people instinctively use Google to find information online. I certainly use Google when doing research for articles like this one. Some visitors click advertisements that display relevant information, and Alphabet has gotten very good at showing relevant advertisements for search queries. Once businesses use Google or YouTube Ads effectively, it’s difficult to leave. Shutting off an ad campaign means walking away from the steady leads and sales that those ads generate. Alphabet continued to grow its advertising segment in the fourth quarter of 2023. During that quarter, revenue increased by 13% YoY. While ads are the big storyline, Google Cloud has been gaining more market share in the cloud computing industry. That segment is also expanding its profit margins, which helped Alphabet report a 52% YoY improvement in net income.  The company’s stock is up by 152% over the past five years and 9% year-to-date.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips The surge in demand for memory stocks underscores the sector’s growth. The burgeoning need for high-bandwidth memory (HBM), essential for Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) AI processors, is driving the interest. The HBM3 standard, introduced by JEDEC in January 2022, marks a significant evolution in memory technology. It offers substantial improvements over its predecessor, HBM2E. Further, it’s designed to meet the rigorous demands of high-performance computing (HPC) applications including AI, graphics, and networking. And HBM3 supports higher densities—reaching up to 32 Gb with stack heights up to 16-high, achieving a total capacity of 64 GB. Also, it doubles the speed to 6.4 Gbps compared to HBM2E’s 3.6 Gbps. This serves to enhance data transfer rates crucial for advanced computing tasks. These enhancements make it an attractive area for investors looking at the high-growth section of the semiconductor market. Let’s explore three companies who are seizing this world of possibilities. SK Hynix’s (OTC:HXSCL) share price has seen an impressive increase this year. This surge is largely attributed to the growing demand for its HBM products.  In fact, SK Hynix is renowned for producing a wide range of memory and storage solutions. These include DRAM and NAND flash memory chips. As a pivotal player in the global electronics market, SK Hynix supplies key components for computers, servers, and mobile devices. The company recently hit a $100 billion market cap. Not only does this position SK Hynix as the second-largest company in South Korea, but also it highlights its competitive edge. Further, SK Hynix develops memory chips that specifically cater to AI applications. SK Hynix is a stock to add to your watch list. Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) is a U.S.-based company specialized in DRAM, NAND, and NOR flash memory products. Its innovations power technologies including data centers, consumer electronics, mobile devices and automotive applications. In February, the company announced the commencement of volume production for its High Bandwidth Memory 3E (HBM3E) solution. A key aspect of this product announcement is that Micron’s 24GB 8H HBM3E is integrated into Nvidia’s H200 Tensor Core GPUs. The latter are expected to ship in the second quarter of 2024.  Further, it boasts a pin speed exceeding 9.2 Gb/s, translating to over 1.2 TB/s of memory bandwidth. This breakthrough allows for rapid data access across AI accelerators, supercomputers, and data centers, facilitating quicker computations and analyses. One of the standout features of Micron’s HBM3E is its exceptional energy efficiency, consuming roughly 30% less power compared to other HBM3E products. Moreover, the 24 GB capacity of Micron’s HBM3E paves the way for seamless scalability in AI applications. This memory solution ensures that data centers are equipped with the necessary bandwidth to handle the tasks at hand. Micron’s stock soared after Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Securities raised its price target from $120 to $144. This affirmation adds confidence in Micron’s potential to meet rising AI-driven demand for high-bandwidth memory. Although renowned for its smartphones, TVs, and memory chips, Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) leads innovation across various tech domains. Samsung is the world’s largest memory producer, placing it at the forefront of the AI revolution. Also, the company’s stock surged earlier this year on a report that it is poised to potentially join SK Hynix as a supplier for Nvidia. This development caused Samsung’s shares to soar.  Additionally, Samsung unveiled its fifth-generation HBM3E chip, marking an industry milestone as the first 36-gigabyte, 12-stack high-performance memory chip. Specifically, Nvidia’s graphics processing units could greatly benefit from Samsung’s HBM3E chips. As a result, Samsung Electronics is now considered a top memory stock, given the rapid increase in HBM chip demand.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips 2024 is shaping up to be a tumultuous year for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). The tech behemoth and smartphone market leaders had been forced to contend with stock price downgrades from banks following lower consumer demand, and now face a landmark lawsuit amid accusations of building an industry monopoly. Apple has firmly denied the allegations, but this has failed to stop comparisons being drawn between the firm and Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) behavior in the 1990s, which resulted in a lawsuit and requirements that the company modify its more monopolistic practices. On Wall Street, there’s already been some damage done to Apple’s stock price. The first quarter of 2024 saw AAPL tumble more than 8%, and the prospect of a costly reprimand could bring a fundamental change in the way that Apple operates which opens the door to stronger smartphone market competition. While the outcome of the lawsuit could hit Apple’s pockets, fundamental shifts in business operations could carry major ramifications for its market dominance. Should Apple be forced to make products more interoperable with other brands and provide more open services, consumers may be free to mix and match brands on an unprecedented scale. This may open the door to the following key smartphone stocks to grow into Apple’s market share:  Unlike Apple, Google parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL,NASDAQ:GOOG) has gotten off to a strong start in 2024, posting growth of around 10% in the first quarter. Back in Q4 2023, Alphabet reported its fastest quarter for revenue growth since early 2022, with sales accelerating 13% from $76.05 billion year-over-year. Despite this impressive expectation-beating performance, share prices briefly slipped due to weaker Google ad revenue. Recently, Alphabet’s stock rallied after reports suggested Google may be readying to put its artificial intelligence (AI) search services behind a paywall. Crucially, AI has been an area where Google has been quick to adopt while Apple’s interest in the emerging technology remained more hesitant. Not only could this offer a crucial fresh revenue stream for Alphabet, but it could also see AI services become a key feature of Google’s next generation of Pixel smartphones, which are readying for launch later this year. With Android as the closest rival of Apple’s iOS smartphone operating system, any challenges to the latter’s attempted smartphone industry monopoly will see Google’s market position improve. Additionally, should Apple be ordered to create cross-functionality throughout its range of smartphone products, we could see a surge in demand for Android products among iPhone users.  Another stock that outperformed Apple in Q1 2024 and could benefit from a de-monopolization of the smartphone market is South Korean firm Samsung Electronics (OTCMKTS:SSNLF). While Samsung experienced slow growth throughout the opening weeks of the year, the recent news that the tech giant could be in line to become a supplier to semiconductor leaders Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) saw a rapid 5% jump in stock value. Currently, Nvidia is testing Samsung’s new range of high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips in what may be a lucrative partnership. Samsung’s advantageous position in the global chip market recovery has seen the firm’s stock price grow of late, and many securities firms are forecasting an operating profit of over 5 trillion won ($3.7 billion) in Q1 2024, up significantly from the 640 billion won ($476 million) recorded one year prior. If these figures are achieved, they would represent Samsung’s largest operating profit since the third quarter of 2022. Samsung’s position in the smartphone market may be another cause for investor optimism in the wake of Apple’s ongoing difficulties. The firm recently revealed the Galaxy ring in January at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. With the Galaxy ring, Samsung is set to enter the smart wearables market while innovating beyond traditional smartphones.  Although it can be difficult to monitor the long-term consumer appetite for smart wearables, the fallout of Apple’s lawsuit could see the Galaxy ring win a new audience among iPhone users. Yes, Nokia ADR (NYSE:NOK) may be trading at just 5% of its market peak during the Finnish firm’s heyday at the turn of the century, but there’s still plenty for investors to be optimistic about for a stock that’s continued to defy expectations in recent years. In Q1 2024, NOKIA grew a healthy 4%, and the stock has recently earned the attention of meme investors who have sought to buy into Nokia through a sense of nostalgia and high retail investor sentiment. Despite the company’s enduring popularity, times have been tough of late for Nokia. Q4 2023 sales of 5.7 billion euros represent a 23% year-over-year decline, while operating profit dropped 27% year-on-year to 846 million euros. Nokia’s recent hardships have prompted a 600 million euro share buyback scheme in early 2024, and telecommunications operator cutbacks and a slowdown among investments in India have caused the company to forecast more difficulty over the year ahead.  These forecasts make Nokia a riskier opportunity for investors, but it’s important to note that the firm’s slowing sales have already been factored into the market, and it’s also worth highlighting that Nokia is continuing to win new admirers amid growing ‘dumb’ phone market sentiment. While it’s been hard for Nokia to compete with Android and iOS market leaders, the firm’s power of nostalgia is seeing more users opt for the app-free offerings of Nokia’s streamlined handsets. While the lure of Nokia’s meme stock status and ‘dumb’ phone popularity could help the company to outperform its expectations in 2024, it may depend on the firm’s relationship with HMD, which has long-manufactured phones for Nokia but may soon begin using its own branding. Either way, Nokia remains a stock that’s worth tracking as an unpredictable 2024 could deliver plenty of market twists and turns.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Laying a strong financial foundation early in life is crucial when choosing stocks for young investors. Taking advantage of the power of compounding allows even modest investments to grow significantly over extended periods. In other words, small, regular contributions can snowball into a significant nest egg over time. The historical performance of the S&P 500 index, averaging around a 10% annual return with dividends reinvested, exemplifies the wealth-creation potential of equities. Thus, the key is to invest wisely, choosing assets, especially robust stocks, with the potential for long-term growth. However, sifting through many stocks and navigating the world of ETFs can feel overwhelming. This article simplifies some of the processes, especially for young readers. Today, we’ll explore three stocks for young investors to build wealth steadily in the years ahead. Known for its unparalleled long-term track record, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) is led by the legendary investor Warren Buffett. Investors eagerly follow Berkshire Hathaway’s annual shareholder meetings, where Buffett and colleagues share sage wisdom. Over the past six decades, Berkshire Hathaway stock has appreciated at an impressive 20% compound annual growth rate, outperforming the S&P 500 by a wide margin. The power of compounding has resulted in remarkable returns for shareholders, making it a compelling choice among our stocks for young investors.  Berkshire focuses on acquiring high-quality companies with strong competitive advantages and strong balance sheets. Management released the fourth quarter and full 2023 results in late February. Net earnings came in at $17.36 per share compared with $8.24 for the same period 12 months ago. Moreover, full-year earnings per share (“EPS) for 2023 was $44.27 versus a loss of $10.33 for 2022. In addition to a jump in operating earnings, the company’s cash holding surged to record levels. So far in 2024, BRK-B stock has advanced 16%, changing hands at 21.9 times forward earnings. Meanwhile, BRK-B’s 12-month median price forecast stands at $453.61, giving an upside potential of 9% from current levels. For young investors, owning a piece of Berkshire Hathaway can be a smart move toward building long-term wealth. Leading e-commerce platform provider Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) is next among our stocks for young investors. The company benefits significantly from the sustained shift towards online shopping worldwide. Fourth quarter revenue grew 24% year-over-year (YOY) to $2.14 billion, translating to even stronger 30% growth after adjusting for the sales of its logistics businesses. Adjusted EPS also surged, reaching $0.34 compared to $0.07 in the prior-year quarter. Free cash flow more than quadrupled YOY as the company moved deeper into positive cash flow territory. E-commerce is projected to continue strong growth in the coming years, while Shopify sits at the heart of this trend, providing merchants with an all-in-one platform. Given its expanding margins, loyal customer base and commitment to innovation, analysts forecast a 35% revenue growth in 2024.  Yet, SHOP stock has lost 4% year-to-date (YTD), offering a better entry point for new investors. However, we should note that shares still command a premium at 14x trailing sales. Meanwhile, Wall Street’s 12-month price target of $85.00 suggests a potential upside of around 14% from current levels. While Shopify’s stock price will likely be volatile the rest of the year, long-term investors could regard $70 as a better entry point. As one of the most actively traded ETFs globally, the SPDR S&P 500  ETF (NYSEARCA:SPY) is the final name on our list of stocks for young investors. The SPY fund tracks the performance of the benchmark S&P 500 index, which measures the stock performance of the largest publicly-traded 500 companies stateside that make up around 80% of the overall U.S. stock market’s value. SPY offers broad exposure to these U.S. businesses’ growth and profitability potential, mitigating single-stock concentration risk. Due to its capitalization-weighted structure, large, well-established firms hold a substantial weighting within the index, influencing their overall performance. Launched in 1993 as the first US-listed ETF, SPY holds over $530 billion in assets. The five largest names in SPY include  Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), accounting for a quarter of the fund’s roster. SPY has gained 8% YTD, while the fund’s top 10 holdings have significantly outperformed the broader market. Yet, the current valuation appears slightly expensive, with trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-book (P/B) ratios of 22.0 and 4.5, respectively. A potential decline towards $500 or below during the upcoming earnings season would mean a more opportune entry point for long-term investors.

      "BofA Securities analyst Vivek Arya reiterated a Buy rating on Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) with a price forecast of $95. The analyst sees Marvell showcasing its broad range of computing, electro-optics, networking, and custom-chip design assets at its “Accelerated Infrastructure For The AI Era Event” on April 11. According to Arya, Marvell could outline a $20 billion- $30 billion incremental TAM, with the potential for a 10%+ share in custom AI accelerators/server ASICs. The analyst also sees a small but incremental opportunity in high-speed Ethernet switches and the ability to maintain the current 62%-63% gross margin profile even if custom chip contributions grow. Arya expects the company to maintain leadership in high-growth optics as the transceiver market doubles over the next few years due to larger AI clusters.  The analyst forecasts the total accelerator market to double year over year in 2024 to about $90 billion and double again towards $180 billion-$200 billion by 2027. Arya projects NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) to maintain 75% share, custom ASIC chips to be a 10%-15% share, and other merchant products to be the remaining 10%-15% share. Overall, Arya projects expect Marvell to become more relevant and eventually claim over 10% share in the custom AI chip market, so $2 billion-$3 billion annually by 2026/2027 vs. $0.6 billion/$1 billion in 2024/25.

      "With interest rates remaining at their highest levels in over two decades, and with U.S. Treasury bonds comfortably exceeding a 4% yield, an increasing number of investors are turning their attention to the realm of corporate bonds. In this landscape, they seek not only promising yield opportunities but also the strategic advantage of diversifying away from equity investments. The Financial Times recently reported that inflows into corporate bond funds have surged to $22.8 billion in 2024, marking the first positive start to a year since 2019. Corporate bonds come in two main types: investment-grade and high-yield. Investment-grade bonds are issued by financially stable companies, while high-yield (or speculative grade) bonds come from riskier firms but offer higher returns. Rating agencies like S&P, Fitch and Moody’s determine which category a bond falls into based on the issuer’s ability to repay debts. Ratings range from AAA (very safe) to D (in default).  For example, companies like Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Eli Lilly Company (NYSE:LLY) and Walt Disney Co. (NYSE:DIS) are rated as investment grade. Conversely, firms like AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. (NYSE:AMC), Office Property Income Trust (NYSE:OPI) and Navient Corporation (NASDAQ:NAVI) belong to the speculative-grade world. Read also: Top 10 US High-Yield Corporate Bonds With Returns Over 20% In April 2024 The cutoff between investment-grade and high-yield is at the BB+ rating. Anything below BB+ is considered high yield, while BBB- or higher is investment-grade. In general, the riskier the bond, the higher the potential return. Investment-grade bonds tend to offer lower yields because they are safer bets, with stronger financial health and better chances of repayment.  However, even within the realm of investment-grade bonds, there are opportunities to find attractive yields from companies with solid fundamentals. This allows investors to earn better returns without taking on excessive risk, compared to investing solely in ultra-safe U.S. Treasuries. Benzinga used the Public.com bond screener to discover which investment-grade corporate bonds offer the best yield as of April 2024.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Unless you live under a rock, you would be aware of the tremendous growth the tech industry has shown over the past year. Driven by artificial intelligence (AI), the industry is hitting new highs and has become a hot sector today. It is driving the Nasdaq higher amid shows signs of an economic recovery. Considering the tech stock giants to buy for Q2 is a smart move. According to Foxconn, the AI server market will generate $150 billion in revenue by 2027 at a CAGR of 49%. However, not all tech stocks are equal, and you must pay attention to the balance sheet, cash flow and revenue growth. Some stocks simply soar higher due to the overall market sentiment but do not stay there long. Look for tech stocks that have the potential to report impressive quarterly numbers and could remain a hot property for the coming months. Here are the three tech stock giants benefiting from AI with a lot of upside from the current level. One of the hottest tech stocks of 2023, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), has been on an unstoppable spree. The stock is up 84% year-to-date and 224% in the year. Trading at $889 today, it has shown some weakness over the past few days and this dip is worth buying. The semiconductor company was once known for establishing a gold standard in the industry for its GPUs for the gaming sector. But in the last year, it has grabbed massive market share for its AI chips. Today, Nvidia controls over 80% of the market, and other companies are closer.  The company also enjoys pricing power and firms are ready to wait for weeks to get their hands on AI chips. Nvidia has steadily impressed investors with strong quarterly results and the fourth-quarter results showed a three times spike in revenue and a massive rise in the net income. Its data center business is one of the fastest growing sectors right now and saw a 400% year-over-year growth. The company recently revealed its Blackwell B200 GPU, the ‘world’s most powerful chip’ for AI. There is high anticipation around it, and the CEO mentioned that it could cost between $30,000 and $40,000. The company will offer steady growth, keep beating estimates and take the stock to $1,000 in the coming months. This tech stock is a strong buy for Q2. There is a lot of talk about which tech company will become the next Nvidia and I think Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) is the closest to it. While both businesses are connected and SMCI depends on Nvidia, it is soaring higher than Nvidia today. Exchanging hands for $1,015, the stock is up 255% YTD and 827% in the year. The company uses its motherboard designs and then integrates them with Nvidia’s processors. Its liquid-cooling GPUs are one of the industry’s best and are taking the company to new heights. Hence, whenever Nvidia’s business grows, Super Micro’s business also soars. It already has early access to the Nvidia chips and is heavily focusing on liquid cooling products. This is what sets the business apart from the rest. AI servers consume high power and need the right cooling servers that Super Micro provides. It is working on enhancing its production capacity, and the expansion moves will allow it to enjoy higher annual revenue.  The company saw its net sales double to hit $3.66 billion in the recent quarter, and its EPS was up by 62%, reaching $5.10 per share. It expects revenue growth from $14.3 billion to $14.7 billion for the full year. Yes, competition is coming up, but it will take time to reach where Super Micro is today, and this will allow the company to make the most of the AI hype. I have been watching Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) for a while now and the often-overlooked stock is a solid buy this quarter. It is expanding the cloud business and is building 100 data centers. As one of the top database software companies, Oracle enjoys rich industry experience and is organically expanding the ecosystem with more software tools. It also launched the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) platform, which offers cloud services enabling application building. Oracle has announced a partnership with Nvidia, where both firms will jointly market Oracle’s AI and cloud offerings and its chips and software. This is a big win for Oracle and considering the soaring popularity of Nvidia in the market, it will help increase Oracle’s orders and show strong revenue growth. It unveiled AI tools this month that allow consumers to see data-driven insights to help their businesses grow. Fundamentally, Oracle is in a strong position, and its stock is up 21% YTD and 34% this year. Trading at $126 right now, the stock looks undervalued to me and is worth grabbing before it soars higher.  In the third quarter, the company saw a 7% surge in revenue, hitting $13.3 billion, and the cloud infrastructure revenue soared 49%, hitting $1.8 billion. The numbers prove that Oracle’s products are in demand and are ready to make bigger moves this year. Several analysts are bullish on the stock amidst growing cloud revenue.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Over the past year, the semiconductor sector has seen a major breakout led by companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). Semiconductors are used to power most technology on the market today including our smartphones, electric vehicles and giant data centers. One of the driving forces behind the surge in semiconductor and chip demand has been the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI). Nearly every big tech company in the world has been integrating AI into their products and services. As a result, powerful chips like graphics processing units (GPUs) have been in high demand and semiconductor companies have been scrambling to make more. The demand is so great that many companies are out of supply and are attempting to scale up production. We believe that these three semiconductor stocks are primed to extend their recent gains in April. Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) is an American semiconductor company that was founded in 1978. It specializes in producing memory chips called DRAM or dynamic random access memory. Micron has an average analyst price target of $121.00 which is right in line with its current price. Recent upgrades have pushed the Street-high price target for MU to $200.00 per share. This stock recently broke through a resistance from its previous all-time high that was set in 2022. Earlier this month, Micron surged through that level due to better-than-expected earnings and generous guidance through 2025. The increase in demand for Micron’s chips due to the AI revolution has drastically improved margins and pushed Micron back to a profitable company.  MU is currently trading at about 7x sales which is quite reasonable for a semiconductor company. The recent resurgence in revenue and profitability has skewed the earnings multiples and has Micron’s revenue compound annual growth rate (CAGR) back on track. Until the recent AI surge, Micron had a five-year revenue CAGR of -9.0%. But in the recent quarter, revenue grew by 58% year-over-year and Micron is projecting that to jump to 75% next quarter. Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is an American semiconductor and infrastructure software company that was founded in 1961. As per Yahoo Finance, 27 of 29 analyst ratings in March had AVGO as a Buy or Strong Buy. It also has an average price target of $1,393.62 which is about 5.0% higher than its current price. This semiconductor company builds what is known as custom chips otherwise known as application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). As you might imagine, Broadcom saw the same tailwinds as companies like Nvidia and AMD. One issue with Broadcom has been the declining sales of its hardware segment. This is one reason why Broadcom has been unable to raise forward guidance despite the growing demand for its custom AI chips. Broadcom’s stock seems expensive because of its share price. Below the surface, AVGO trades at just 28x forward earnings and 14x sales. The company has a five-year revenue CAGR of 13% but that could rise as Broadcom shifts more of its focus to its custom AI chips. Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL) is a Delaware-based semiconductor company that also builds ASICs used in data centers and other technologies. The current share price of Marvell is below even the lowest analyst price target of $71.00 and is about 30% lower than the highest price target of $100.00. The average target is $88.33 which still represents about 20% upside.  As with most semiconductor companies, Marvell has seen a major boost from the AI industry. Data centers and custom chips are going to be the lifeblood of AI. Fortunately, Marvell specializes in both of these products. Top-line revenue growth in the double digits is forecasted through fiscal year 2026. That is a nice acceleration from its pre-AI revenue. MRVL trades at a bit of a premium compared to some of its semiconductor peers. Currently, shares trade at about 47x forward earnings and 11x sales. With revenue forecast to accelerate, these multiples should either return to Earth or provide a major boost to Marvell’s market cap and share price moving forward.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Despite being a leader in the rollout of artificial intelligence products, Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock hasn’t set the world on fire lately. That might be about to change. Year to date, Microsoft stock is up 13%, which is a little better than the 11% gain achieved by the benchmark S&P 500 index. In the last 12 months, the technology giant’s stock has risen 46%. While decent, the gains pale in comparison to those achieved by other companies that are closely associated with AI. Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock is up 225% over the last year while Meta Platforms’ (NASDAQ:META) share price has increased 136%. Of course, Microsoft is more than an AI company. But it is AI that is likely to drive the company’s sales and profits, and share price, moving forward. Microsoft has been making big bets on AI ever since it invested $10 billion into privately held OpenAI, the company whose AI chatbots took the world by storm last year. More recently, Microsoft has announced plans to build a massive data center to run AI software that could require an investment of $100 billion. That would be an incredible investment considering that Microsoft’s total capital spending over the last four years combined was $104 billion.  The data center investment, which also involves plans to develop an AI supercomputer called “Stargate” for launch in 2028, is the latest example of Microsoft going all-in on AI.  In February of this year, Microsoft announced that it is ramping up its investments in AI around the world, pledging to spend $5.60 billion in Europe alone. At the same time that it is increasing its spending, Microsoft is also pushing to monetize the technology and boost its sales and profits. The best example of the monetization efforts can be found with Microsoft Copilot, the company’s AI chatbot or assistant. Microsoft is now charging subscriptions of $30 a month for access to Copilot, and Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives forecasts that it could add $25 billion to $30 billion to Microsoft’s revenues by 2025. Ives recently boosted his price target on MSFT stock to $500 from $475 and stated that the “AI revolution is here.” Also citing the monetization of Copilot, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) maintained a “buy” rating on Microsoft’s stock and a $480 price target, calling the company a “top pick.” Beyond AI, there are many other business units that are accelerating and benefitting Microsoft. These include the Xbox unit following the successful $69 billion acquisition of video game maker Activision Blizzard, and the Azure cloud-computing segment. Cloud was a particular bright spot in Microsoft’s fourth quarter 2023 earnings report. The company reported that revenue from Azure and other cloud services grew 30% year over year in Q4. Analysts had forecast growth of 27.7%. Microsoft stock now has 53,000 Azure AI customers, and one-third of them are new to Azure in the past year, said the company in its earnings release. Commitments to spend more than $1 billion on Azure cloud services in the year ahead increased during  Q4 2023. Today, Microsoft is the second largest cloud-computing company in the world after Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Data from the Synergy Research Group shows that Microsoft’s Azure infrastructure controls 20% of the world’s $130 billion cloud market. Together, Amazon and Microsoft control 52% of the global cloud market, and cloud-computing remains a huge growth driver at Microsoft.  Microsoft stock achieved a milestone earlier this year when its market capitalization surpassed $3 trillion and it became the biggest publicly traded company in the world. Going forward, more growth and gains can be expected, especially as the company monetizes its AI offerings. With leading role in areas ranging from not only AI but also video games, cloud-computing, and software, Microsoft remains a best-in-class technology concern that should be part of every investors’ portfolio. MSFT stock is a buy. On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in NVDA and MSFT.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Augmented reality (AR), still in its early stages, is set to grow rapidly as recent innovations bring new products to market and ultimately reduce costs. Estimating the market value of augmented reality is challenging, yet conservative predictions suggest it could reach up to $58 billion by 2028, with $38 billion in sales expected this year alone. That growth makes AR stocks a hot opportunity to capitalize on long-term tech trends still in their relative infancy. With the emergence of any new technology, a flood of new companies, startups and innovators are entering the market, seeking investor attention. But not all will succeed. For those interested in strong buy AR stocks, sticking with well-known, reputable companies is the safest bet today. Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), a leading augmented reality manufacturer, is unlikely to allow new market entrants or current competitors to usurp its position. Its collaborative effort with Samsung and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) reinforces its dominance in hardware and signals a promising future as the augmented reality markets evolve. The partnership plans to develop a comprehensive mixed-reality platform, capitalizing on Qualcomm’s technological expertise, Samsung’s hardware prowess and Google’s investments in augmented reality tools. While we’re waiting for a definitive product announcement, industry analysts predict the collaboration will result in a series of headsets offering novel virtual reality experiences, which could significantly boost Qualcomm’s revenue.  In addition, Qualcomm is continuously upgrading its broad virtual reality product array, including headsets. Equipped with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon processor, these products feature the most advanced WiFi technology and eye-tracking capabilities, driving forward innovation in the augmented reality domain and setting new benchmarks for the industry. Though a ways off from its past $3 trillion market cap, Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) ventures into augmented reality remain a top prospect for investors looking for strong buy AR stocks. The company has impressively sold as many as 200,000 Vision Pro headsets already, despite its hefty $3,499 price tag. Sales are expected to increase as the product’s capabilities become evident to early adopters, and the cost of units eventually declines. A potential issue on the horizon is the possibility of the Vision Pro cannibalizing sales from other Apple products, particularly tablets and iPads, which are already experiencing a sales decline. Apple finds itself at a pivotal moment, anticipating the stabilization of Vision Pro sales and determining whether this new hardware and augmented reality technology will be a temporary trend or replicate the groundbreaking impact of the iPod in the mid-2000s. Regardless, Apple currently stands as the leading augmented reality stock, making it an excellent choice for investors seeking a blue-chip entry into the burgeoning market. Meta (NASDAQ:META) closely trails Apple but might soon overtake it as a leader in the augmented reality (AR) market. A major consumer review has placed Apple’s Vision Pro and Meta’s Quest Pro on equal footing, rating them both at four stars. However, Quest Pro’s much lower price point positions the product not merely as a cheaper alternative to Apple’s but as a cost-effective innovator independent of the brand-name weight Apple carries. That distinction makes Meta a compelling AR stock option. Beyond the Quest Pro, Mark Zuckerberg and his team are reportedly working on projects that could significantly impact their AR efforts. In mid-January, Zuckerberg announced significant investments in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) chips. The move supports Meta’s AI development and suggests a major commitment to building a “massive compute infrastructure” likely to enhance AR platforms, particularly with AI integration.  Matching Apple in the realm of blue-chip AR stocks, Meta represents a reliable investment to tap into emerging trends within the developing AR sector.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Now that the fervor over SoundHound AI (NASDAQ:SOUN) getting backing from chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has subsided, investors can take a more sober look at the potential for the artificial intelligence (AI) stock. It was only that disclosure that set the voice recognition company soaring from around $2 per share to over $10 a stub but now it needs to be judged on its own merits. This will have important implications for investors interested in SoundHound AI stock. For as long as SoundHound AI stock has been around (it was founded in 2005), its history as a public company has been less than stellar. It began trading at $8.72 per share almost exactly two years and after running as high as $15 a share shortly thereafter, it’s been all downhill since. Investors are right to ask whether SoundHound AI stock is really worth investing in. Unlike a lot of other companies that glommed onto AI only after OpenAI released ChatGPT to the world, SoundHound AI has always been an AI stock. Perhaps best known for its music identification app, SoundHound unique voice AI technology has always been about converting speech to meaning instantaneously and in real time. It’s why you were able to hold the SoundHound app up to a radio and have it immediately identify the song playing. It was a vast improvement over typical speech recognition technologies. Those had to first convert speech to text and then convert the text to meaning. SoundHound’s technology is based on what it calls “deep meaning understanding,” or the ability to understand complex conversations.  Because SoundHound’s technology uses collective AI, it learns from the rest of it connected domain. Where other technologies learn linearly one conversation at a time, the collective AI platform is always learning from users. So why has SoundHound AI grown more? Well, it is growing. Numerous deals have been signed with major companies to incorporate its voice AI technology into the products and services. Snap (NYSE:SNAP) was an early user of SoundHound’s AI capabilities and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) signed on several years ago to use SoundHound’s voice user interface for its Da Vinci reference design kit (RDK). It lets users communicate with set-top boxes, broadband gateways and internet of things (IoT) devices. There are over 100 million such devices in use today. It should be noted, though, Netflix apparently canceled its contract with the voice AI stock. Television manufacturer Vizio (NYSE:VZIO) also integrated SoundHound’s AI technology into all of its smart TVs. The AI specialist also just announced Stellantis (NYSE:STLA) will be the first automaker to go into full production in Japab this month using SoundHound’s voice assistant with integrated ChatGPT. It will have initial capabilities for 13 languages in 18 countries. SoundHound has been in certain EV models from Hyundai (OTCMKTS:HYMLY) since 2021. Short-seller Capybara Research says several other automakers, however, subsequently canceled their contracts. Still, now that artificial intelligence has been brought to the fore, SoundHound AI should have a much easier time making these deals.  SoundHound is already gaining traction. Fourth-quarter revenue shot 80% higher to $17.1 million with gross margins rising six percentage points to 77%. Full-year revenue was $45.9 million, a 47% increase year over year. Yet investors should also realize SoundHound AI stock is still a money-losing operation. After 19 years in the business it has yet to figure out how to make money off of its AI technology. But that too could be changing. While it reported a loss of 7 cents per share in the fourth quarter, that was a 53% improvement from last year. Even on an adjusted basis EBITDA was still a loss of $3.7 million. But that was an 80% improvement from 2022. It’s clear SoundHound AI is on the cusp of profitability. So while this small-cap stock does carry risk for investors it is still early innings for its business. And now that it has financial backing from Nvidia, the use case for SoundHound AI has dramatically improved. So has its visibility. This should be a growth stock to own for the long haul.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Everybody and his uncle is looking for the “new” or “next” Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). I’m telling you right now, it’s Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU). The artificial intelligence hardware industry is booming and if you really want to participate and build wealth, look at Micron Technology stock. Micron isn’t currently a member of the Magnificent Seven. However, if there’s a reshuffling of the Mag-7 or some other elite group replaces it, Micron should definitely be included. I assure you, once you’ve seen Micron’s recent financial results, you’ll be a believer. Clearing the $100 level was a sticking point for many years, but the Micron Technology stock buyers finally achieved this in March. It’s not a bubble but a well-deserved milestone moment as Micron rides the AI-infrastructure wave to the top. Just to recap, Micron doesn’t specialize in AI-compatible graphics processing units like Nvidia does. That’s good news for Micron, as it means that the company doesn’t have to compete directly with the all-powerful Nvidia.  Micron develops and sells memory chips, including AI-enabled high-bandwidth-memory (HBM) chips. The company is actually collaborating with Nvidia; as Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra explained, “Our HBM3E product will be a part of Nvidia’s H200 Tensor Core GPUs, and we are making progress on additional platform qualifications with multiple customers.” In the AI-hardware market, there’s nothing better than a partnership with Nvidia. Furthermore, Micron’s HBM chips are apparently selling like hotcakes. According to Mehrotra, “Our HBM is sold out for calendar 2024, and the overwhelming majority of our 2025 supply has already been allocated.” Along with Micron’s collaboration with Nvidia, investors can celebrate the company’s long-awaited pivot back to a profitable profile. After five consecutive quarters of negative EPS, Micron posted positive EPS in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. For that quarter, Micron expected to report an earnings loss of 28 cents per share while Wall Street predicted that the company would lose 25 cents per share. The actual result was a gain, not a loss, of 42 cents per share.  Micron’s top-line results should convince any skeptics to jump into the long side of the trade. Impressively, Micron generated $5.824 billion in Q2 FY2024, up 57.7% year over year versus $3.693 billion in the year-earlier quarter. Also, this result easily surpassed the company’s quarterly revenue forecast of $5.3 billion. Clearly, Micron knocked it out of the park with its recently released round of quarterly results. At the same time, Micron’s partnership with Nvidia looks like a win-win scenario for both companies. So, is Micron the “new” or “next” Nvidia? And, should Micron be a Mag-7 (or maybe Mag-8) member? I’d say the answers are yes and yes. No matter how you slice it, Micron is staging a powerful comeback with its fast-selling, AI-compatible HBM chips. Thus, now’s a great time to buy Micron Technology stock for a confident buy-and-hold position.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Semiconductor stocks continue to get a lot of attention. The emergence of artificial intelligence necessitates a greater supply of chips making semiconductor stocks like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) especially hot. Chip packaging firms –  also integral to AI –  often receive less attention. This has led to my list of chip packaging stocks for a semiconductor boom on the horizon. Yet, the chip packaging Market is expected to grow by 9.2% annually between 2023 and 2032. That growth rate is sufficient to produce strong returns for investors. A semiconductor package is a plastic, ceramic, or glass casing that contains one or more semiconductor devices or integrated circuits. End users continue to demand smaller, lighter chip packages for increasingly complex applications. The companies discussed below are meeting that demand and are expected to grow steadily through this decade and into the 2030s.  Amkor Technology (NASDAQ:AMKR) is a company that provides a wide variety of packaging and test services. The company is located in Arizona and its stock is relatively well regarded. The company attributes its 2023 outperformance relative to the semiconductor industry to its focus on advanced packaging. One of the primary reasons investors will be interested in Amkor Technology is that the company supports AI Packaging needs. The company is a leader in 2.5D packaging, a technology that integrates multiple circuits in one package. Artificial intelligence will require more and more advanced packaging techniques and Amkor Technology is a leader in that regard. 2023 was a year of cyclical downturn across the chip industry. Amkor Technology was affected and sales declined by 8%. However, the company increased its dividend by 5%. That’s a sign that the company is not only stable but also interested in placating shareholders. AMKR continues to be a strong pure-play packaging and testing investment. This makes it one of those chip packaging stocks for a semiconductor boom. Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) is a diverse semiconductor stock and a company that provides packaging equipment. One of the things that applied material does is vacuum coating that deposits a uniform barrier on top of the chip. The company’s role to roll vacuum coating systems set the industry standard. The coating extends the shelf life of the chip.  Applied Materials stock is performing particularly well in 2024, having grown by 30%. the company is benefiting from strong AI demand And there is some evidence that the down cycle has reached a bottom point. Applied Materials is performing well as the demand for memory chips increases. The company is well diversified across the semiconductor supply chain meaning it has many catalysts. AMAT stock has proven volatile over the past few years. when the markets are strong it stands out as an even stronger performer. 2024 continues to look bright and that suggests that Applied Materials could continue to outperform. Investors are generally aware  that ASML (NASDAQ:ASML) has cornered a portion of the chip Supply chain. Read about the stock and it’s likely you will encounter the phrase extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV). ASML dominates that process and is essentially the only company producing the machines responsible for that process. Lithography is a vital component of the packaging process. That makes ASML arguably the best chip packaging stock available to investors. Lithography itself is a process of transferring geometric patterns onto material covering a semiconductor wafer. ASML has refined the technology to its current apex which is why the stock is so valuable: No one else can do what it does. The company is developing updated EUV tools that have the potential to revitalize the already strong company. That technology is expected to enable the new generation of smaller, lighter chips. The so-called High NA EUV tools are part of a system that is as large as a double-decker bus and costs $350 million each. In conclusion, it’s one of those chip packaging stocks for a semiconductor boom.  TSMC (NYSE:TSM) Is one of the most important chip stocks globally. The company is the world’s largest  semiconductor foundry. That means almost every semiconductor firm outsources some of their production to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. Part of the company’s operations includes advanced packaging services. The company offers turn key solutions that address diverse packaging issues. The company notes that packaging is again vital to innovation in the chip sector. Not long ago it was something of an afterthought but packaging technologies are now critical to maximizing function and cost. The company is considering plans to establish a packaging plant in Japan. Currently, all of TSMC’s packaging capacity exists in Taiwan. However, booming demand due to advanced packaging requirements for artificial intelligence means TSMC will likely expand  beyond its borders. The fact that TSMC is willing to expand beyond its borders for the first time ever should signal to investors just how critical packaging is at this time.  Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) stock is getting a lot of  attention lately. The reason for that attention is primarily because of its relationship with Nvidia. Micron is a well-known memory specialist. It is one of the leading producers of high bandwidth memory (HBM). Nvidia’s  upcoming h200 chips will require more HBM. Fortunately for Micron Technology, it recently began production of the HBM that will be used in those h200 chips. That strong catalyst is one of the primary reasons to believe Micron Technology will continue to rise higher. However, in the context of this article, Micron Technology remains interesting because it engages in packaging. The company engages in wafer level packaging And also produces multichip packages. Multichip packages are applicable to a number of growing Industries including the Internet of Things (IoT). Micron shares had suffered for quite some time as the memory specialist saw demand for all. However, it is rising again as its specialist capabilities are again seeing renewed demand. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) stock continues to be interesting at the moment for a number of reasons. the chipmaker is being subjected to a number of forces that have the potential to move its shares.  One of the biggest pieces of news is that the Chinese government has moved to block the use of American processors in government issued computers. Intel is one of those providers and that caused the market to react negatively when the news was announced. However, China will face significant problems in attempting to replace American processors with those made domestically. Those advanced processors rely on ASML’s EUV lithography machines which are currently banned from importation into China. I personally don’t think Intel is in much trouble at all at the moment. The company is highly favored by the US government and recently was awarded $20 billion in subsidies. That funding should help Intel to continue to grow as one of the most important packaging and foundry firms in the semiconductor space. KLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLA) is a chip stock that doesn’t get a lot of attention over all. The company isn’t a particularly well known name to investors. However, KLA Corporation is noteworthy for investors interested in various chip sub sectors including packaging  and equipment. The company sells equipment that detects defects on the surfaces of patterned and unpatterned wafers. Those wafers are also known as integrated circuits (ICs)  which are themselves chip packaging. The company also provides equipment that enables the etching process on those wafers making it somewhat diversified.  Although KLA corporations most recent earnings period provided results above guidance investors are somewhat worried. The reason for their worry is the company’s upcoming quarter guidance. That forward guidance was given two months ago and it appears that the down cycle may have reached a bottom. That suggests that KLA corporation’s guidance may end up being excessively negative. In turn, KLA shares have the potential to outperform.  On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) stock has seen an eye-watering rise of more than 250% this year and is valued at $59 billion. The company manufactures high performance server and storage solutions in the US, making it crucial for AI applications and companies. More servers are needed to handle future demand. Will Super Micro continue to dominate this space? Let’s dive into whether SMCI stock could have further to run from here. Super Micro started the year off right, revealing that revenue surged over 265% in Q1 on a year-over-year basis. This has paved a way for the company to reach a $60 billion market capitalization, and a seat in the S&P 500 index.  The surge was driven by increased demand for AI products and strong Q4 financial results, which doubled revenue. The company’s net profit surged from $176 million to $296 million, with management raising forward guidance because of ongoing demand. The stock rallied further following strong financial results from Nvidia, whose revenue surged from $6.5 billion to over $22 billion. Analyst sentiment turned bullish, with 10 out of 12 analysts issuing positive ratings. JP Morgan and Bank of America rate it overweight and buy, respectively. SMCI’s upcoming quarterly earnings report on April 18th will show its performance and demand trends. Analysts expect Q1 revenue at $4.01 billion, signaling continued robust growth from the previous year’s quarter. After the release of its results, two key levels will be closely monitored. Substantial numbers may propel the stock to retest its March peak at $1,226, marking a 16% increase. Conversely, a revenue shortfall or guidance downgrade could drive SMCI stock down to $856, its recent low.  Super Micro Computer has established a strong foothold in the competitive tech industry, mainly credited to its rapid time to market. Barclays views this agility as SMCI’s prime advantage, especially against AI server rivals. With leading AI chipmakers like Nvidia accelerating product launches, SMCI’s ability to promptly align its server offerings positions it as a standout competitor with shorter development cycles. SMCI’s rapid product deployment extends beyond mere availability; it encompasses a robust support ecosystem. Upon NVDA, AMD, or INTC’s silicon product launches, SMCI ensures seamless integration through tailored design assistance. As demand surges for high-performance computing amid AI, big data, and cloud computing trends, SMCI’s swift adaptation to new chip technologies offers a competitive advantage. This agility enables SMCI’s clients to adopt emerging technologies, enhancing their market competitiveness swiftly. SMCI stock soared more than 800% in the recent AI surge, largely due to its AI-optimized servers. While its revenue doubled in the second quarter, GPU supply is still constrained.  CEO Charles Liang highlights supply constraints hindering faster growth. However, the projected growth rate still runs up to 107%, adding more optimism for investors. SMCI continues to collaborate closely with Nvidia, dominating the data center GPU market. The company’s proximity to this trend allows for seamless design integration, offering superior customization and faster product launches. With a price-earnings ratio below 50 and a $59 billion market cap, SMCI presents a promising investment opportunity in AI servers. That is, for those with a long enough investing time horizon.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Investment managers tend to flock to a select group of outperforming stocks that drive consistent returns. The stocks top money managers can’t live without generally hail from sectors like technology, healthcare and consumer staples. However, tech reigns supreme, hosting stocks that permeate most portfolios. In particular, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) represent core technology holdings found among an overwhelming majority of money managers. For instance, Apple constitutes Warren Buffett’s top position at Berkshire Hathaway, making up over 40% of its holdings. Meanwhile, Ken Fisher, Mairs and Power, Philippe Laffont’s Coatue Management and Fidelity’s Contrafund all share top stakes in Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon as well. Exciting AI and metaverse plays like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) entice more risk-tolerant managers. However, Microsoft, Appl and Amazon remain the cherished stocks top money managers can’t live without thanks to their dominant positions and immense growth runways in cloud computing, e-commerce and beyond. This article explores why these big tech companies represent such a significant allocation across top investment managers’ portfolios. With its strong fundamentals and competitive edge, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is undoubtedly one of the stocks top money managers can’t live without. As many portfolio managers have wisely realized, Microsoft is exceptionally positioned for long-term outperformance. This is especially obvious when taking into account the near monopoly the company holds across some of the company’s key business segments.  Powering Microsoft’s success is its cloud dominance. The tech titan’s robust cloud platform remains unrivaled, fueling its Q2 2024 revenue growth to $62 billion, up 18% year-over-year. Such financial strength confirms Microsoft’s near monopoly status in major tech sectors. Plus, with sturdy operating income up 33% to $27 billion for the quarter, Microsoft has the backing to continue expanding its cloud, AI and metaverse lead. Adding to its upside potential, Microsoft is making big metaverse moves — evidenced by its monumental $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard last October. This deal fortifies Microsoft’s supremacy in gaming while allowing for tremendous metaverse monetization ahead. With gaming revenue already up 61% in Q2 2024, Microsoft is clearly on track to deliver metaverse profits down the road. Given its cloud dominance, metaverse momentum and exceptional growth metrics this quarter, Microsoft epitomizes one of the key stocks top money managers can’t live without for both present returns and future-forward gains. Its coveted brand and dominant position in consumer technology make Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) one of the favored stocks top money managers can’t live without. The iPhone maker continues to ride on hardware sales and services revenue, surpassing Wall Street estimates. In its latest earnings report for the first quarter of fiscal 2024, ending Dec. 31, 2023, Apple posted over $119 billion in quarterly revenue, an increase of 2% YoY. Fueled by robust iPhone demand during the holiday season, Apple even faced supply chain constraints that limited sales growth. Still, the results beat expectations. This resilience confirms why Apple remains a favorite among institutional investors and top money managers.  Bolstering its hardware ecosystem further, Apple recently unveiled a mixed-reality headset called Vision Pro in January 2024. The $3,499 premium device with both AR and VR capabilities targets creative professionals and showcases Apple’s ambitions in futuristic technologies. Although niche for now, it expands Apple’s total addressable market. With immense brand loyalty and an installed base exceeding 1.8 billion active devices globally, Apple retains pricing power and stable revenues. Top money managers see these qualities as enduring competitive strengths no matter the economic climate. Additionally, Apple’s services segment hit an all-time revenue record of $23.1 billion last quarter, up 11%. Offerings like Apple Music, iCloud, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade and more drive this high-margin recurring revenue stream. Such resilience makes Apple one of the stocks top money managers can’t live without, even amidst market uncertainty. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has firmly established itself as one of the stocks top money managers can’t live without thanks to its dominant position in global e-commerce and cloud computing. The company reported staggering net sales of $574.8 billion in 2023, up 12% year-over-year. Operating income also soared to $36.9 billion, triple that of the previous year. Driving this growth is Amazon’s core online retail segment, which continues to make up a significant portion of total sales. However, its true crown jewel is Amazon Web Services (AWS) — the company’s cloud computing arm. AWS raked in revenue of $91 billion in 2023, with operating margins hitting a superb 30%. With the global cloud market expected to hit $1.6 trillion by 2030, AWS provides an immense growth runway. Geographically, too, Amazon still has plenty of room to expand. Online shopping only accounts for 16% of total U.S. retail sales, a number that Amazon has greatly influenced. By securing nearly 40% of all U.S. e-commerce spending, Amazon is poised to benefit tremendously as more shopping moves online. Given these outstanding fundamentals and growth prospects, it is no wonder that money managers view Amazon as a core long-term holding. Nearly every major mutual fund has a sizable stake in Amazon stock.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips The technology sector is more dynamic than ever. Companies not investing enough in research and development will likely go into oblivion. I am not only talking about technology companies but entities across sectors that fail to adopt new innovations. In the recent past, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has grabbed headlines. As the market for AI swells, its stock remains a hot commodity. However, the focus of this column is on the lesser-known or under-the-radar technology stocks for multibagger returns. Talking about the scale of growth, AI is expected to contribute up to $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. Of that, “$6.6 trillion is likely to come from increased productivity, and $9.1 trillion is likely to come from consumption-side effects.” There will be multiple participants from the technology sector towards this growth contribution. The addressable market is, therefore, significant, and I am just talking about AI. Let’s discuss three under-the-radar technology stocks that can be massive value creators.  Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) was listed in September 2023 and has trended higher by 123% in 6 months. However, being a relatively new listing, ARM stock is still under the radar. Further, I believe the company will likely create immense value in the next five years. As an overview, Arm Holdings develops and licenses central processing unit products and related technologies. Semiconductor companies and original equipment manufacturers are the end users of the company’s products. For Q3 2023, Arm reported revenue of $824 million, up 14% year-on-year (YoY). For the same period, the company shipped 7.7 billion chips. It’s worth noting that the company’s trailing 12-month free cash flow was $724 million. Considering steady growth in license and royalty revenue, I expect annual FCF to be more than $1 billion in the next 24 months. An important point to note is that until 2016, Arm was focused on general-purpose CPUs. Currently, the company has AI-enabled CPUs tailor-made for specific industries. These industries include IoT, consumer electronics, cloud networking, automobile and mobile. The addressable market is, therefore, significant for the coming years. Amdocs (NASDAQ:DOX) provides software and services to the telecommunication and media industry globally. In the last 12 months, DOX stock has remained sideways and trades at an attractive forward price-earnings ratio of 13.7. Further, the stock offers a dividend yield of 2.14%. Given the fundamentals and industry growth potential, DOX stock is worth holding for the next five years.  For Q1 2024, Amdocs reported revenue of $1.25 billion and a record 12-month backlog of $4.21 billion. Further, the company reiterated its free cash flow outlook of $750 million for the year. It’s also worth noting that Amdocs has a liquidity buffer of $1.1 billion. That is important to mention as Amdocs has been investing to stay ahead of the curve. The company has also pursued opportunistic acquisitions. As an example, Amdocs is working on Generative AI strategy acceleration. In February, the company expanded its partnership with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to drive Generative AI innovation for the telecommunication industry. Photronics (NASDAQ:PLAB) is another undervalued technology stock to buy. Even after a rally of almost 75% in the last 12 months, PLAB stock trades at a forward price-earnings ratio of 13. I would bet on multibagger returns from the stock over an investment horizon of five years. As an overview, Photronics is a global provider of photomask products and services. These photomasks are used in manufacturing integrated circuits and flat panel displays. The company also provides electrical and optical components. For Q1 2024, the company reported muted revenue growth of 2% YoY to $216.3 million. However, the order rates have improved, which could translate into growth acceleration. For Q2, the company has guided for revenue of $231 million with an operating margin of around 28%.  Besides the numbers, I am bullish on the long-term growth outlook. With the incorporation of chips in IoT, 5G, crypto and consumer products, the demand for photomasks will remain in an uptrend. Further, Photronics is focusing on margin expansion, and as cash flows swell, PLAB stock is likely to trend higher.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips While innovators have flourished this year thanks to artificial intelligence and other advancements, it may seem difficult to find the most undervalued tech stocks to buy in April. After all, the ecosystem has garnered so much attention that many companies command rich premiums. However, the market features thousands of opportunities. And even specific sectors feature a wealth of possible ideas. It’s just not possible for Wall Street experts to cover them all. So, it’s definitely reasonable – with some digging around – to find underappreciated gems. Of course, you’ll have to accept a higher risk profile. If you’re okay with that, these are the most undervalued tech stocks to buy in April. Listed under the semiconductor equipment and materials segment of the tech ecosystem, Photronics (NASDAQ:PLAB) engages in the manufacture and sale of photomask products and services in the U.S. and other countries. Per its public profile, the company offers photomasks that are used in the manufacture of integrated circuits (ICs) and flat-panel displays (FPDs). It also specializes in transferring circuit patterns onto semiconductor wafers.  While most of the spotlight centers on the “front-facing” semiconductor companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), investors should look into what goes on behind the scenes. Essentially, companies like Photronics keep the show running smoothly, making it a strong candidate for most undervalued tech stocks to buy in April. Currently, PLAB stock trades at a trailing-year earnings multiple of 12.78X. Also, it trades at 1.95X trailing-year revenue. Both stats are undervalued compared to their sector median values. Further, analysts project that in fiscal 2024, Photronics should enjoy decent earnings and sales growth. D.A. Davidson is currently the only analyst that covers PLAB stock, assigning a “buy” rating (but without a price target). Another semiconductor enterprise, Himax Technologies (NASDAQ:HIMX) is a fabless semiconductor enterprise that provides display-imaging processing technologies in China, Taiwan and many other nations. The company operates in two segments: Driver IC and Non-Driver Products. Mainly, it focuses on display driver ICs and timing controllers used in televisions, laptops and automotive solutions, among many other applications. Again, Himax isn’t exactly what you call a front-facing enterprise. However, it’s absolutely critical in the smooth running of the tech space, especially consumer electronics. Still, Wall Street isn’t exactly giving HIMX its dues. That means right now, shares trade at a trailing-year earnings multiple of 18.72X, below the sector median 32.8X.  On the top line, HIMX trades at only 0.98X trailing-year sales. That seems very low considering the broad relevancies. To be fair, analysts are only looking for earnings growth in fiscal 2024 while they anticipate negative growth in revenue. For top-line expansion, investors may have to wait until fiscal 2025. Still, a lone analyst rates HIMX a buy with a $7 price target. That seems more reasonable based on the underlying utility. It’s one of the most undervalued tech stocks to buy in April. Conducting business in the communication equipment space, ViaSat (NASDAQ:VSAT) provides broadband and communications products and services worldwide. According to its corporate profile, ViaSat’s Satellite Services segment offers satellite-based fixed broadband services, including broadband internet access and voice over internet protocol services to consumers and businesses. It also offers in-flight entertainment and aviation software services to commercial airlines and private business jets. Undoubtedly, VSAT is one of the riskiest ideas in terms of the most undervalued tech stocks to buy in April. Since the start of the year, shares succumbed to 41% worth of red ink. In the past one-year period, it’s down almost 52%. Still, if the economy happens to march forward, ViaSat could potentially see increased demand. Here are the stats. Shares trade at a trailing-year earnings multiple of 2.18X. As for the revenue multiple, we’re talking about 0.45X. Both stats are subterranean compared to the industry. However, the intriguing aspect is that analysts see fiscal 2024 revenue landing at $4.22 billion, up 65.3% from last year’s print.  Also, they peg VSAT as a moderate buy with a $32.20 price target, implying 95% upside potential.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips While the innovation space seemingly lacks no shortage of interest, not every enterprise benefits from the spotlight, which brings us to tech stocks ready to rebound. Yes, there are indeed certain compelling tech plays that aren’t getting the attention they deserve. To be sure, the space is speculative. Let’s be real. The usual suspects – your Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) or Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), to name but a few examples – enjoy significant upside momentum in part because everybody else believes in their potential. When you step away from the spotlight, the environment becomes much more adventurous, to put it diplomatically. Nevertheless, if you’re looking to be a fourth-quarter hero (as in football, not fiscally), then these tech stocks ready to rebound could be right up your alley. Falling under the infrastructure software category of tech stocks ready to rebound, Shift4 Payments (NYSE:FOUR) provides software and payment processing solutions in the U.S. and internationally. Per its public profile, Shift4 offers multiple products and services, including an omni-channel card acceptance and processing solution platform.  One of the key reasons why FOUR stock should be on your radar is Wall Street’s assessment of the business. Currently, experts rate shares a consensus strong buy with a $93.18 average price target. Further, the high-side estimate calls for a price tag of $105 per share. Aside from a bum note in the fourth quarter – when Shift4 posted earnings per share of 76 cents against a target of 82 cents – the company was a top performer. In fiscal 2023, the average earnings beat (including the Q4 miss) came out to 25.95%. For fiscal 2024, experts are looking at EPS of $3.68, well above last year’s print of $2.83. Also, revenue should land at $3.75 billion, up a massive 46% from 2023’s result of $2.56 billion. Another entity within the software infrastructure arena, LiveRamp (NYSE:RAMP) operates a data collaboration platform. Per its corporate profile, the company provides a mechanism to unify customer and prospect data to build a single view of the customer in a way that protects consumer privacy. LiveRamp sells its services to many industries, including insurance, retail and automotive, among many others. As with Shift4 Payments, one of the reasons to consider RAMP is Wall Street’s support. Right now, RAMP enjoys a unanimous strong buy rating. Further, the average price target lands at $48.75, with the most optimistic target reaching $51.  Notably, LiveRamp beat all its quarterly bottom-line targets for fiscal 2023 and by a wide margin. The average positive earnings surprise came out to an impressive 56.78%. For fiscal 2024, experts see EPS hitting $1.47, above last year’s print of 86 cents. Also, the company could ring up sales of $648.28 million, implying almost 9% year-over-year growth. It’s one of the tech stocks ready to rebound. Listed under the semiconductor segment, Allegro MicroSystems (NASDAQ:ALGM) designs, develops, manufactures and markets sensor integrated circuits (ICs) and application-specific analog power ICs for motion control and energy-efficient systems. Primarily, it provides original equipment manufacturer (OEM) components for the automotive and industrial markets. A middle-capitalization, Allegro doesn’t receive the attention of some of the heavyweights. Still, ALGM makes a strong case for tech stocks ready to rebound. For one thing, analysts rate shares a consensus strong buy. Further, the average price target comes in at $38.13, with the high-side estimate landing at $45. While its fiscal performance hasn’t exactly lit up the board, it’s consistently profitable. In 2023, Allegro beat all its quarterly bottom-line targets. Its average positive earnings surprise reached 6.65%. The best performance came in Q4, when it posted EPS of 32 cents against a 29-cent target.  For fiscal 2024, experts believe EPS will hit $1.32, up from last year’s $1.28. Also, they’re looking for sales growth of 7.2% YOY to $1.04 billion. Operating under the application software segment, Intapp (NASDAQ:INTA) provides industry-specific cloud-based software solutions for the professional and financial services industry in the U.S., U.K. and internationally. Some of its solutions include a platform that helps manages financial services firms’ market relationships, along with those of prospective clients. Intapp also provides offerings that help its enterprise clients maximize the benefits of artificial intelligence. As with the other ideas for tech stocks ready to rebound, INTA enjoys strong support from Wall Street. Indeed, the security lands a unanimous strong buy rating. Notably, the average price target stands at $50.44, while the high-side estimate calls for $57. Fiscally, one of Intapp’s strengths is consistent profitability. Interestingly, experts keep doubting it. For example, in Q1, the company posted earnings of three cents per share against a breakeven target. In Q4, it posted EPS of 11 cents against a target of five cents. For fiscal 2024, analysts see EPS of 34 cents, well above last year’s print of 11 cents. And revenue could reach $425.04 million, up 21.1% YOY.  Falling under the consumer electronics category, Sonos (NASDAQ:SONO) designs, develops, manufactures and sells audio products and services in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia-Pacific. Per its corporate profile, Sonos offers wireless, portable and home-theater speakers, along with components and accessories. It’s a risky play but a possible improvement in consumer discretionary sentiment could help SONO stock. Despite the current headwinds, analysts appreciate the enterprise, rating it a consensus strong buy. Enticingly, the average price target reaches $29.52 while the high-side estimate calls for $55. Of course, a main concern is that in the past 52 weeks, SONO has been all over the map. Fiscally, the problem manifests in the bottom line. Overall, the average surprise in 2023 came in at 0.48%. That’s not exactly encouraging. However, in Q4, the company delivered EPS of 64 cents against a target of 39 cents. For fiscal 2024, analysts believe EPS will reach 25 cents. If so, that would be a dramatic shift from last year’s print of a loss of eight cents per share. However, investors may need to wait till fiscal 2025 for revenue growth to materialize. Falling under the application software segment, Braze (NASDAQ:BRZE) operates a customer engagement platform that provides interactions between consumers and brands worldwide. According to its public profile, the company offers data ingestion products, such as Braze software development kits that automatically manage data ingestion and deliver mobile and web notifications, in-application/in-browser interstitial messages and content cards.  While Braze might not get everyone’s attention, those in the know believe it’s one of the tech stocks ready to rebound. Analysts rate shares a consensus strong buy. It’s only one hold rating shy of a unanimous buy rating. Overall, the average price target reaches $68.86, with the high-side estimate coming in at $80. While the company isn’t profitable, it is beating its bottom-line target. For fiscal 2023, the average surprise jumped to 45.18%. Its best performance was Q2, when Braze delivered a loss of 4 cents against expected red ink of 14 cents. For the current fiscal year (2025), analysts are looking for significant growth: $574.15 million on the top line, beating out last year’s print of $471.8 million by 21.7%. Listed under the consumer defensive space, Coursera (NYSE:COUR) operates within the education and training services subcategory. That about explains it all. According to its corporate profile, Coursera operates an online educational content platform in the United States, Europe, Africa, Asia-Pacific, the Middle East and internationally. Given the changes in the workforce post-pandemic, COUR could be an intriguing idea for tech stocks ready to rebound. Now, don’t get me wrong – COIUR is extremely volatile. With that, the analysts’ consensus view comes in at a moderate buy. Still, I suppose the optimist might say that a buy is a buy. Not only that, the average price target of $23.20 will likely pique curiosity among bullish speculators. Also, the low-side target of $15 still implies growth.  Despite the heightened risk profile, Coursera gets the business done. For example, the company posted EPS of 6 cents in Q4, above analysts estimation of a breakeven quarter. It also beat out quarterly projections earlier in the year by a wide margin. For fiscal 2024, experts see significant growth: a revenue target of $736.45 million or 15.8% up from last year’s print of $635.76 million. Thus, it could be one of the tech stocks ready to rebound.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Microchip and semiconductor concern Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has led the market ever since the current rally began in autumn 2022. Its run has been incredible. Since October 2022, NVDA stock has increased 695%. The company’s share price has risen an astounding 1,765% over the last five years. The growth has pushed Nvidia’s market capitalization to above $2 trillion and made it the third largest publicly traded company in the world after Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). The key to the success of NVDA stock has been the rising demand for the company’s chips and semiconductors, which are used to power artificial intelligence models and applications. The massive worldwide demand has led to a surge in Nvidia’s sales and profits. For the final quarter of 2023, Nvidia reported that its sales increased 265% from a year earlier and its profits grew 769% year over year. The company’s earnings reports have become a highly anticipated and closely watched event across the entire stock market. So who will be the next Nvidia? Which companies are positioned to steal its crown? Here are three AI stocks that will leave Nvidia in the dust. Shares of Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) are running circles around Nvidia right now. MU stock has risen by 34% in the past month after the company announced financial results that beat Wall Street forecasts and provided upbeat forward guidance driven by AI demand. Micron, which makes memory and storage for computers and specializes in USB flash drives, announced in March earnings per share of 42 cents compared to a loss of 25 cents that was expected among analysts who cover the company.  Revenue amounted to $5.82 billion versus $5.35 billion, which was expected on Wall Street. Management said the company is benefitting from the current AI boom, with demand for its memory and computer data storage products rising. Micron provides memory and storage for new AI systems around the world. Looking ahead, executives said they expect to report revenue of $6.60 billion for the just-completed first quarter, which is above the $6.02 billion that was expected by analysts. Thanks to its post-earnings bounce, MU stock has now been up 55% since the start of this year and has more than doubled over the last 12 months. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is nipping at Nvidia’s heels. One of its most direct competitors, AMD, as the company is known, has developed a series of microchips specifically for AI models and applications that it hopes will rival Nvidia’s chips and semiconductors. Last December, AMD unveiled a new series of microchips called the “Ryzen 8040” that are aimed at boosting AI applications by up to 60%. Those new chips will be incorporated into laptops and personal computers (PCs). AMD has also launched the new MI300X accelerator microchip that’s used in data centers and servers and competes against Nvidia’s AI data center chips. Companies ranging from Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) to Microsoft have been buying up the MI300X chips, and AMD executives have said that they expect the data center microchips to generate $2 billion in sales for all of this year. The new AI microchips and decent earnings have AMD stock up 87% over the last 12 months, including a 30% gain so far in 2024. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (NYSE:TSM) is arguably the most important company to Nvidia and the entire AI industry. This is because TSMC, as the company is popularly known, makes three-quarters (75%) of the microchips in the world, including those designed by Nvidia, as well as nearly all the chips and semiconductors that power AI technologies. The growing importance of TSMC to the AI and chip industries has its stock up by 52% in the last year, including a 39% year-to-date gain.  During their most recent earnings call, TSMC executives said that the company is well-positioned to capture current and future growth opportunities, especially related to AI. Taiwan Semiconductor is increasingly focused on AI chips and semiconductors as it executes a global expansion plan. The company recently opened its first microchip plant in Japan, moving beyond its home market in Taiwan. It is also developing two new microchip plants in Arizona at a cost of $40 billion. TSM stock has more than tripled over the last five years. On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in NVDA and MSFT.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Government contracts and regulations highly influence space stocks. Yet high-growth initiatives continue to emerge. New 3D printing and materials technologies are increasingly making space stocks more viable. Also, investors should be comfortable with a higher risk due to heavy capital needed for initial lift off. In fact, the space-related market is heading for steady growth in satellite deployment, science applications and exploration. According to a CoherentMI report, forecasted CAGR is 8.9%, from $518.48 billion market size in 2023 to $1.1 trillion by 2030. Let’s examine three best space stocks to buy in April that aren’t far off from their 52-week lows.  Besides SpaceX going public, Rocket Lab USA (NASDAQ:RKLB) has served as the next best exposure to space stocks. Having deflated from its 52-week high of $8.05 by 95% to present $4.11, RKLB is now in discounted territory. The company’s biggest flop happened last September with the failure of its Electron rocket to deliver satellites for Capella Space. To secure more funding and pay off existing debt, Rocket Lab closed the private offering of $355 million worth of convertible senior notes in February. However, in the space sector, failures happen. Despite some setbacks, Rocket Lab managed to beat its previous launch record in 2023 with 10 launches. Likewise, the new record was set for signed launch deals at 18 Electron and 7 HASTE contracts. HASTE is for the emerging suborbital market space. In 2024, Rocket lab is avoiding mission failure, having launched multiple satellites within the “Four Of A Kind” mission for Spire Global and NorthStar Earth & Space. Without any profitable quarters during 2023, Rocket Lab’s gross margin improved from 12% in Q1 to 26% in Q4. Twelve months ahead, 10 analyst forecasts pulled from Nasdaq view the average RKLB price target at $8 versus the current $4.11 per share.  Despite negative public spotlight throughout 2024, Boeing (NYSE:BA) is now 8.7% above its 52-week low of $176.25 compared to present $193. It is a rare market opportunity when wide moat stocks such as BA are so heavily discounted. Playing the key role in the U.S. military machine, Boeing isn’t going anywhere, regardless of scandals or CEO stepping down. As a space stock, the company has been NASA’s key player in developing the CST-100 Starliner to deliver astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS). Within its Defense, Space & Security (BDS) division, the Boeing Satellite Development Center (BDC) deployed over 50 satellites to date. Also, other investors are well-aware of Boeing’s infrastructural role in military and aero-space. So, it is likely that its 52-week low will not be revisited. Not accounting for major airplane crashes or more suspicious whistleblower deaths, 22 analysts pulled by Nasdaq view the average BA price target at $243.78 vs current $193 per share. Spire Global (NYSE:SPIR) has had a massive rally over the year. Presently priced at $12, the stock is up 262% from its 52-week low of $3.31 per share. Although far from being discounted, investors should understand why Spire Global is hot and if the trend is likely to continue.  Not directly involved with launches, Spire delivers space-to-cloud data analytics to track hundreds of satellites orbiting Earth. Having a recurrent service model for both private and government sectors, such as NASA and NOAA, the company handles real-time satellite data and transforms it to an actionable format to customers. Most recently in March, Spire Global partnered with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)to deliver AI-powered weather predictions. The company concluded 2023 with the 10th consecutive quarterly revenue growth. It showed 50% operating loss improvement from $16.3 million in Q4 of 2022 to $8.2 million in Q4 of 2023. Based on insights from seven analysts aggregated by Nasdaq, SPIR could go even higher. The average price target is $22 versus its current $12 per share.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips The technology industry has outpaced nearly another market sector within the last year and has added a tremendous amount of growth to the S&P 500. The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund is considered a benchmark for the tech industry, which has grown by 37% within the last year. The ever-advancing field of generative AI and other innovative technology, such as cloud computing and increased semiconductor production, has led the technology industry down a path of immense profitability. Here are a few investment options within the tech industry that have performed very well recently. They are also strong buy stocks that could continue to grow throughout 2024. Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) is primarily a technology infrastructure company that offers storage and server systems such as full racks, blade servers, security software, subsystems, and rack-mount servers. Its products are used in data centers, artificial intelligence, and cloud computing technology. Super Micro Computer has been one of the best-performing stocks in the market over the past year, growing nearly ninefold during that time due to increased earnings growth and a surge of investors flocking to companies that provide new and innovative tech, especially within the cloud computing and generative AI industries.  On Jan. 29, SMCI released its earnings for the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, in which it stated that total revenue more than doubled to $3.7 billion, and net income rose by 68% compared to the previous year. Management reported that the anticipated revenue for SMCI in the third quarter of FY 2024 is between $3.7 billion and $4.1 billion. Earlier last month, it was announced that Super Micro Computer would be added to the S&P 500 following its scheduled rebalance. SMCI replaced Whirlpool (NYSE:WHR). This move further legitimizes Super Micro Computer as a strong company with further upside potential, which makes it a great option for investors in 2024, even after its impressive share price growth. AppLovin (NADSAQ:APP) is an application software company that provides an advertising infrastructure platform with products such as MAX, Spark, AppDiscovery, SparkLabs, Array, and Adjust. Similar to SMCI, AppLovin has received plenty of positive attention for its involvement in innovation within the generative AI space, which has brought tremendous growth. On Feb. 14, APP repotted earnings results for the fourth quarter of the full year 2023, in which it stated that it beat analyst expectations for total revenue, which increased by 36% year-over-year. Its earnings per share were forty-nine cents per share, which beat by fourteen cents per share. In a press release, AppLovin reported a secondary offering of common stock by KKR Denali Holdings of nearly 20 million shares. It has also announced a share buyback program of $570 million worth of shares.  Over this past year, its share price has more than quadrupled, with continued growth expected due to its strong positioning within the rapidly growing tech industry. It is a solid pick for investors looking for greater exposure within companies that have profited heavily from the expansion of generative AI. ACM Research (NASDAQ:ACMR) is a producer of semiconductor-related equipment. It offers wafer cleaning equipment and electrochemical plating technology. ACM Research is still surprisingly considered an undervalued company, especially in the realm of many other semiconductor-related stocks such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), which have experienced growing popularity and a large increase in overall share price. On Feb. 28, it reported earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023, which stated that net income increased by 64% year-over-year. ACMR also beat analyst predictions for revenue by $21 million and earnings per share by twenty-six cents per share. ACM Research is a strong buy stock within the semiconductor industry. Its share price has more than doubled within this last year, primarily due to its outstanding earnings report for the fourth quarter, which immediately, upon release, propelled its share price by over 40%. It is poised for continued growth with revenue guidance for the full year 2024 of between $650 million and $750 million, topping the full-year 2023 results of $558 million by at least 17%.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips We’re at a crossroads in this current market. Tech and growth stocks continue to soar while undervalued stocks lag. That dynamic has been in play for some time. However, the so-called “Magnificent 7” stocks continue to steal the spotlight away from other very profitable and high-growth companies worth considering. Several companies could produce much better growth than most of the Magnificent 7 stocks. Here are three growth stocks with greater potential than the Magnificent 7, that investors may not want to sleep on. After peaking at around $225 per share, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock has certainly given up some of this year’s gains. Now that the trade is below the $180 per share level, cooler heads have prevailed, and investors are now wondering whether it is time to consider building positions in the #2 chip player position in the U.S. The fact that Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has absolutely overshadowed AMD is no surprise. It remains a stock I’m bullish on, partly due to the company’s recent Blackwell GPU release and its other AI innovations. The thing is, I think the overall AI chip market is big enough for both players. AMD forecasts $3.5B in revenue from MI300 GPU, signaling substantial growth. Analysts predict a 20-30% market share in AI data center GPUs, bolstered by competitive pricing. Additionally, AMD’s AI-compatible CPUs for PCs offer significant growth prospects.  Moreover, renowned leaks suggest AMD’s Zen 5 Ryzen 9000 CPUs could be 40% faster than current models. Details on the impending desktop processor battle are scarce, but sources anticipate significant performance gains for AMD’s next-gen chips. Investing in Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) stock hinges on confidence in Salesforce’s new focus on profit margins and generative AI. Despite Q4 earnings exceeding estimates, fiscal 2025 revenue guidance fell short. However, one upside is that the company will be giving out its first dividend and share buyback plans, signaling that now is a good time for investors to buy and hold this stock for the long term. Anticipated revenue growth in 2024 is picking up, but Salesforce is working on improving efficiencies simultaneously. The company reported it cut 10% of its workforce last year, highlighting management’s goal of improving profitability. Analysts predict further job cuts as this trend continues. Additionally, the company ceased merger exploration, signaling no significant acquisitions are likely on the horizon. This likely means greater cash flow, which should bleed into a higher CRM stock over time. Additionally, rising corporate digital spending benefits Salesforce, known for subscription-based sales, marketing, e-commerce and data analytics software. As the software market continues to see solid growth, this is one of the top ways to play this space, in my view. Surging more than 130% in 2023, pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) currently has more upside, according to analysts. The consensus average price target on LLY stock is $845, implying more than 10% upside from current levels. That’s a reasonable estimate, given the company’s dominant position in the weight-loss drugs market.  The recent approval of Zepbound, among the leading weight-loss drugs, positions Eli Lilly as a company to be contended with in this space. This is a pharma giant with phenomenal growth potential, with earnings per share expected to soar more than 97% this year. Looking to next year, these estimates come in at a still-high 45%. That kind of growth can drive meaningful multiple expansion over retime. Pharmacies continue to encounter supply challenges with Eli Lilly’s GIP/GLP-1 obesity drug, Zepbound, due to “unprecedented” demand. That said, that’s a good thing, at least for investors. This outsized demand should lead to considerable profits as the company scales production. Despite not being on the FDA’s shortage list, pharmacies nationwide struggle to maintain stock. This is a trend that’s likely to continue for some time, though investors would like the company’s production to meet demand at some point soon. LLY stock isn’t cheap by any stretch. However, this company has some solid long-term secular catalysts supporting its valuation. So, for now, this is a stock worth holding onto for at least the next 12 months for investors looking for outperformance in their growth portfolios.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips With Wall Street going wild for anything remotely associated with artificial intelligence, it’s time to add another name to the list: computer memory and storage products specialist Micron (NASDAQ:MU). While it’s not delivering the performance of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) or Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI), MU stock has been a hot commodity, gaining over 55% year to date. It could get even hotter. Recently, Bank of America Securities analyst Vivek Arya assigned a “buy” rating on MU stock along with a price target of $144. The analyst believes that the security could soar on surging demand for AI. Thanks to Micron’s high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chip technology, it could help feed the increasingly intense demands of smart technologies. Additionally, Arya believes that Micron is in an excellent position to increase its market share of the HBM sector from less than 5% to the mid-20% range. According to Mordor Intelligence, the HBM space may reach a valuation of $2.52 billion this year. By 2029, it could hit $7.95 billion, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 25.86%. Moving onto the technical arena, MU stock closed the Wednesday session at $128.01. During afterhours trading, shares gained more than 1%, moving the price tag to $129.49. Based on the “whole number” concept, it’s possible that the bulls will aim to push shares to $130.  Interestingly, the market tends to move tradable assets toward round numbers. The more important levels – such as $130 – could experience significant activity. It may stem from the psychological satisfaction we humans see from “clean” numbers. Now, we’re not here to add to the psychological research but rather to use this knowledge to our advantage. Indeed, many other trading systems have noted this phenomenon and use it to draft profitable tactics. Therefore, the market will almost surely drive MU stock to the next biggest “clean” number, which is $130. Even more compelling, it’s possible that the optimists will try to push MU stock to $140. Looking at Barchart’s Trader’s Cheat Sheet, we see significant resistance barriers running from $130.42 to $137.93. It won’t be an easy ride to $140, that’s for sure. However, if the last resistance line at $137.93 falls, it could be game on for the bulls. With MU stock, there are two clear opportunities available. One is a near-term wager that Micron will reach $130. My idea would be to consider the 12 April 2024 $130 call, which closed at a premium of $2.90 on Wednesday. Here, the bid-ask spread as represented by the midpoint price is relatively narrow at 2.09%. That’s likely because of the huge volume influx. Another idea for longer-term speculation is to consider the 19 July 2024 $140 call. Here, the premium stands at $9 due to the much-longer period till expiration. However, the spread is only 1.08%, which is enticing. Given how fast AI-related enterprises have soared over the past year or so, it shouldn’t take too long for MU stock to reach for this milestone price.  Granted, it’s a higher-risk proposition. But with so much passion for digital intelligence, MU stock should be on your radar.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips On the one hand, April is when spring comes into full bloom. On the other hand, April is tax season during which we pay the piper and settle up with Uncle Sam. However, I’m convinced this is a great month to be an investor, so I’m always looking for A-rated stocks to buy in April. April is historically a good month for the stock market. Since 1945, April has averaged a return of 1.6%, tied only with December as the best-performing month of the year. Some of this can be attributed to Uncle Sam and the tax filing deadline. If you’ve done well on your taxes and are getting a return, congratulations! One of the best things you can do with that money is to put it into the stock market, which brings a potential uptick in stock prices. April also kicks off the second quarter of the year. Companies report their first-quarter earnings in April, providing investors with a bellwether of how the rest of the year will look. Solid earnings reports can drive stock prices higher.  I’m using the Portfolio Grader to find the best A-rated stocks to buy for April. These stocks get their “A” ratings because of their solid performance, earnings growth, analyst sentiment, and momentum. Any of them would be a great pick if you want to splash the market this month. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is revolutionizing the tech industry with its powerful graphics processing units that can power artificial intelligence and machine learning applications. The stock rose nearly 240% in 2023 and its revenue soared to more than $20 billion per quarter, a ridiculously steep increase that pushed Nvidia’s market cap to more than $2.2 trillion. But if you’re betting that Nvidia’s growth is a bubble getting ready to pop, you’re betting on the wrong horse. Nvidia is just getting started. Big Tech stocks are all clamoring to incorporate generative AI into their products. And while it’s still unclear which of these companies will ultimately emerge as king of the heap, Nvidia is in the enviable position of having a virtual monopoly with its generative AI chips.  And that was even before it unveiled its Blackwell GPUs, the latest in Nvidia’s line of AI chip products that should help extend Nvidia’s growth runway through 2024 and beyond. NVDA stock is up 80% in 2024 and gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader. I’m starting to think of Nvidia and Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) going hand-in-hand these days. SMCI  has an immensely powerful position in providing the infrastructure, including server and storage solutions, that a company using NVDA’s chips will need. The stock has risen nearly tenfold over the past year, hitting $1,000 per share. While some skeptics believe that Supermicro is a bubble ready to pop, I still believe that another rally could be at hand. Annual revenue for the AI server market is expected to grow from $39 billion in 2023 to $200 billion by 2027. Supermicro won’t get all that business, but it should see more than its fair share.  SCMI stock is up 255% in 2024 and gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is my top pick for social media stocks that should have an outstanding April. Thanks to its Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp platforms, the company counts nearly half the world’s population as active users. After a horrendous 2022, Meta managed to turn things around in 2023 by getting back to basics: focusing on profitability and its core business. The company’s headcount is down by 22% from a year ago. Meta Platforms showed fourth-quarter revenue of $40.1 billion, up 25% from a year ago on the strength of improved advertising dollars. Income of $14 billion and $5.33 per share improved from $4.6 billion and $1.76 per share a year ago.  Look for Meta to continue to harness the power of AI and machine learning to optimize advertising and bring value to its customers. META stock is up 40% this year and gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader. With over 10,800 locations, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) is the biggest retailer in the world. And it uses that power to its advantage. CEO Doug McMillon describes how Walmart purposefully keeps the prices of its own brands low, which pressures national brands that want to display their goods on Walmart shelves to lower their prices to Walmart as well. This not only appeals to shoppers who are looking to stretch their dollars, but it also undercuts the competition and puts Walmart in a better position to dominate its local markets. Walmart has locations in every state and more than two dozen countries, giving it a massive footprint. And it also has a thriving e-commerce division, which reached $100 billion in sales in 2023.  WMT stock is up 12% in 2024 and gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader. Eli Lilly & Co. (NYSE:LLY) is a top pharmaceutical company with the advantage of being on the ground floor of one of the hottest healthcare developments in years. Lilly sees massive potential with its obesity drug, Zepbound. The National Institutes of Health estimates that 42% of U.S. adults are obese, and there are dozens of diet programs and trends that make billions of dollars from customers who are looking for a way to drop some weight. Zepbound’s solution is an injectable drug that helps people lose weight. About 1 in 3 people who took the drug at its highest dose (15 mg) report losing more than 58 pounds over a 72-week period. The drug is so popular that some pharmacies are reporting shortages.  Analysts say Zepbound could be worth $25 billion a year or more in revenue to Lilly. That massive potential is why LLY stock is up 31% in 2024. It gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader. International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) just keeps rolling along. The company is one of the oldest and best-known computing companies, responsible for generations of advances. While some technology companies come and go, Big Blue has been a mainstay since the early 20th century. Even today, IBM computers handle as many as 90% of all credit card transactions and serve over 90% of financial institutions. Today, IBM is one of the biggest cloud infrastructure providers in the world. And it has one of the best-known names in generative AI, watsonx, which will help attract customers looking for support for AI applications and cloud solutions. For instance, golf fans watching the Masters Tournament this year will be able to see shot-by-shot insights on the Masters website and app, including data-driven projections and analysis for each hole.  IBM stock is up 15% in 2024, and gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader. Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) transformed and disrupted an entire industry when launched its ridesharing business. It opened a path for people who don’t own a taxicab to earn money as a side gig. And it rode that business model to profitability. Today, Uber is a massive company with more than $160 billion market capitalization. And its continuing to grow, expanding into food delivery with its Uber Eats service. It’s expanding into India, the globe’s most populous country. And it’s being added to the Dow Jones Transportation Average. Uber said it computed 2.6 million trips in the fourth quarter, up 24% from the previous year. Gross bookings were up 22% to 37.5 billion, and the company’s revenue was up 15% to $9.93 billion. For the full year, Uber saw $137.8 billion in gross bookings, up 19% from 2022, and revenue of $37.2 billion, a gain of 17% from a year ago.  UBER stock will only continue to grow from here. The stock is up 25% in 2024 and gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader. On the date of publication, Louis Navellier had a long position in NVDA, SMCI and LLY.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock has emerged as Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) main AI market. The focus shifts to how this will affect Nvidia’s market share. Meta (NASDAQ:META) and Microsoft’s (NASDQ:MSFT) planned switch to AMD chips, representing 60% of Nvidia’s sales, indicates significant potential shifts. In the AI surge, AMD trails only Nvidia, which is known for its rapid growth. With AI’s rapid growth, AMD holds promise as the second-largest AI chip player. Considering this, let’s dive into why AMD stock remains an excellent option for investors looking for exposure to this space. AMD stock is up meaningfully on the year (roughly 28% higher), but still clearly trails the likes of Nvidia and other AI stocks. This relative valuation gap has been growing, and makes AMD stock an attractive option for growth-at-a-reasonable-price investors, who have clamored to own this stock at lower levels. Concerns around China’s chip replacement strategy briefly impacted prices, and Nvidia’s release of next-generation Blackwell GPUs certainly altered some investors’ view of the competitive landscape of this industry.  That said, it’s a global game, and though China makes up around 15% of AMD’s sales, there’s a lot to like about the company’s relative positioning in the PC market, which appears to be stabilizing. A recent surge in global PC demand bodes well for AMD’s client processor business. Similar growth prospects loom in server CPU and GPU markets. AMD’s server CPU market share rose to 23% in 2023 from 17.6% a year prior, driven by solid demand for EPYC CPUs, noted CEO Lisa Su. The company noted a rising adoption of EPYC CPUs for inferencing tasks. The company’s server CPU growth is sustained, aligning with a projected 26% annual growth in AI server demand until 2029. AMD experienced a robust demand for AI GPUs, raising its data center GPU revenue forecast to $3.5 billion from $2 billion.  Management expects surpassing this figure because of an enhanced supply chain. These factors position AMD favorably to exceed analyst forecasts. In its Q4 2023 report on January 30, 2024, AMD projected Q1 2024 revenue to come in at $5.4 billion, nearly matching the prior year’s $5.35 billion. The semiconductor company sees a 52% non-GAAP gross margin, slightly higher than 2023’s 50%. When talking about revenue, experts expect a much lower number of around $5 billion. With the potential AI-related advantages mentioned, AMD may surpass market expectations significantly. Its recent decline lowered the company’s valuation, with AMD stock now trading at 49-times forward earnings and less than 13-times sales. While expensive, AMD remains the relative value play in the chip space right now, making this an attractive option if the company can blow out earnings expectations in the coming quarters.  AMD trails Nvidia in AI but possesses potent AI accelerator designs and is leveraging third-party manufacturing solutions. If AMD gains AI market share, it may move up in terms of investor discussions alongside Nvidia. Hence, the shift led to reinvestment in undervalued stocks favors AMD, at least right now. Of course, plenty of downside is possible, if the company disappoints in its coming quarterly earnings reports. However, I remain bullish on this stock for now, and believe the AI market is big enough for two players to benefit. Right now, the market disagrees.

A leading analyst highlights the China headwind in a new note, with potential good news coming. The Apple Analyst: Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives has a Buy rating on Apple and $250 price target. Related Link: Apple Unveiling AI Strategy At WWDC 2024 Will Be A ‘Watershed Moment,’ Says Wedbush’s Dan Ives: Stock Could Go ‘Massively Higher’ To $250 The Analyst Takeaways: Apple faces one of the toughest demand environments in China over the last five years, according to Ives.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips After a big run to start the year, Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock looks to have stalled. But don’t worry. It likely won’t be long before the rally in the chipmaker continues. In the last month, NVDA stock has dipped 5%. The stock has struggled to rise above $950 per share and has retreated each time it hits that level. However, the current pullback comes after Nvidia had a huge run in January and February. Year to date, the stock is up 83% and a leader in the S&P 500 index. The current dip is likely only a temporary breather before NVDA stock again runs flat out. As such, investors would be smart to buy the dip. The rally in Nvidia’s stock that began in earnest at the start of 2023 has pushed the company to some important milestones. Earlier this year, Nvidia’s market capitalization crossed the $2 trillion mark and it is now the third largest publicly traded company in the world after Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). The company’s influence on the market is growing and the main catalyst for NVDA stock continues to be the company’s earnings. Since last summer, the stock market literally pauses in the days ahead of Nvidia’s earnings reports. It’s as if investors and traders are holding their collective breath to see if the company can exceed the lofty expectations that have been set for it. So far, Nvidia hasn’t disappointed and the entire market rallies after the company beats Wall Street’s forecasts. In February, Nvidia reported earnings that covered the final quarter of 2023 that crushed expectations and showed mind boggling growth at the microchip and semiconductor maker.  Fueled by unrelenting demand for its microchips and semiconductors among artificial intelligence (AI) companies around the world, Nvidia reported that its Q4 2023 sales rose 265% year over year, while its profits grew 769% from a year earlier. All metrics topped analysts’ estimates, and the guidance provided was even better. For the just completed first quarter of the year, Nvidia has forecast sales of $24 billion. If achieved, that would be up 234% from sales of $7.19 billion a year earlier. Can Nvidia do it again? There’s no reason to doubt the company at this point. The big question concerning Nvidia on Wall Street is how long can the company continue to exceed the sky high expectations that have been set for it? After all, the comparables the company faces are only getting tougher. At some point, Nvidia will fail to jump the bar that’s been set for its earnings and the stock will crash, right? Maybe not. Nvidia is continuing to pull out all the stops to stay ahead of its competitors and ensure that its earnings run at a blistering pace. In March, Nvidia unveiled its next generation AI microchips at a developer conference. Called the Blackwell series, the first of these new chips, the GB200, is the company’s most powerful technology to date. Specifically, the new GB200 chip includes what Nvidia calls a “transformer engine” that’s designed to run transformer based AI, one of the core technologies underpinning chatbots such as GPT-4. Nvidia is already receiving huge pre-orders from companies such as Microsoft and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). At the same time, Nvidia has signalled its intention to become less of a microchip provider and more of a platform provider going forward. To that end, the company introduced new revenue-generating software called Nvidia Inference Microservice (NIM) that it will charge a subscription fee for enterprise customers to access. And, Nvidia continues to expand globally, recently announcing plans to build a $200 million AI center in Indonesia as it grows throughout Asia. Nvidia currently controls about three-quarters (75%) of the AI chip market worldwide. That dominance shows no signs of decreasing. If anything, Nvidia’s market share is likely to increase as it begins to deliver its Blackwell series of microchips later this year. While the company’s earnings and stock have produced blockbuster gains over the last 18 months, there’s every reason to believe that the growth will continue. The bottom line is that Nvidia has the expertise and the products to remain the foundation of the AI revolution. For this reason, NVDA stock is a buy.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips If you’re investing under the assumption that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is infallible and invincible, think again. As the company shows cracks in the armor, AAPL stock gets a “D” grade and we’re not giving it a confident recommendation today. We’ve already pointed out some problems with the seemingly almighty Apple. For example, iPhone shipments fell by approximately 33% year over year in February. In the first six weeks of 2024, iPhone sales declined 24% YOY. Stick around, as there’s more evidence that, so far, Apple is having a less-than-stellar year. As of April 5, AAPL stock was down 8.65% year to date. That’s definitely not a magnificent performance for a Magnificent Seven stock. It’s a sign that everything isn’t necessarily going well with Apple. And here’s another sign: Apple is now resorting to layoffs.  Remember, Apple CEO Tim Cook previously declared that mass layoffs would be a “last resort.” Yet, here we are and Apple is laying off 614 employees in California. Apparently, this unfortunate news came after Apple gave up on Project Titan, the company’s attempt to build an electric vehicle. Nearly 2,000 employees were working on that project, so don’t be surprised if more workers are let go at some point. It might feel strange to witness Apple failing at something. Yet, we have to be forthright and acknowledge that Project Titan was a titanic failure that will cost some people their jobs. You’d think Apple’s management would learn their lesson from this unfortunate experience. You might also think that Apple would stick to its core businesses, such as selling smartphones, for a while. Yet, very soon after Project Titan’s failure, Apple is jumping headfirst into personal robotics, of all things. Reportedly, Apple is developing robots to follow people around in their homes, in hopes that this will be the “next big thing.”  Wedbush analyst Dan Ives is highly skeptical of Apple’s new personal-robotics endeavor. He contends that Apple should focus on artificial intelligence as CEO Tim Cook’s “legacy is going to be AI.” Ives argues that Apple’s foray into household robots would be a “black-eye moment” and a “horror show” for the company. As Apple scraps Project Titan and starts laying off workers, it’s clear that the company isn’t invincible. Plus, it’s risky for Apple to jump into the personal-robotics field. As Ives suggests, Apple really ought to devote its capital and effort to AI rather than to household robots. Overall, it looks like Apple is going through a rough patch. Until there are clear indications that the rough patch is finished, it’s hard to be confident about AAPL stock. So, we’re assigning a “D” grade to the stock and investors can choose to stay on the sidelines for now.

      "(RTTNews) - Apple Inc. (AAPL) has recently announced a significant change in its App Store regulations, allowing developers to incorporate retro game console emulator apps on its platform. Apple's strategic decision to embrace emulation apps is perceived as a preemptive measure to retain users amidst the EU's ruling mandating the allowance of third-party app stores. This decision has been communicated to developers via email. The updated guidelines not only permit developers to offer game emulators for iOS, but they also allow retro game emulator apps to provide downloadable games. It is noteworthy that developers of emulator apps bear full responsibility for the software within their apps, ensuring compliance with the guidelines and relevant laws. This implies that only companies owning the rights to supported games may release emulators ultimately. By integrating game emulators into the mini-apps and game streaming section, developers can now openly list them on the App Store while adhering to safety guidelines. This move is expected to deter users from exploring alternative distribution channels.  Additionally, this policy shift opens up opportunities for Android emulator developers to introduce their apps to Apple devices, thereby expanding the emulation ecosystem on the platform. Overall, Apple's decision to embrace game emulators on the App Store signifies a significant shift in its approach, allowing users to relish classic titles from past decades on modern devices.\n",
      "(RTTNews) - Apple (AAPL) is gearing up to beat its rivals in the AI game by upgrading its devices with the latest technology. The tech giant has recently signed a deal, worth up to $50 million, with Shutterstock to license millions of images, video and audio content to train its AI large language models, according to Apple Insider. The alleged deal could improve the image generation and editing capabilities of iPhones, by enhancing the AI image recognition technology. Moreover, iPhone users could take advantage of improved voice recognition and automatic transcription with the help of video and audio content from Shutterstock, whose data is also currently being used by Alphabet, Inc's (GOOG) Google, Amazon (AMZN) and Meta Platforms (META) for developing their AI engines. This announcement follows similar ongoing negotiations by Apple with various publishers such as Conde Nast IAC, and NBC to use their content from news articles to train AI models.  According to a report by Reuters, Apple is also in talks with Photobucket to utilize its over 13 billion photos and videos to help AI in generating appropriate images in response to text prompts. The California-based company's Senior VP of Worldwide Marketing, Greg Joswiak, has frequently hinted on social media platforms that the upcoming WWDC conference will be \"Absolutely Incredible,\" as it will be primarily focused on the newly added AI features to the devices.\n",
      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips The Magnificent 7 stocks were in a league just over a year ago. Nowadays, the group has fallen through, with many folks narrowing down the exclusive basket to six, now five or four. At this pace, we may be left with just one Magnificent stock standing as Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) continues its epic rally on the back of the AI boom. Let’s not be so quick to give up on the companies within the group that have lost their way. Long-term investors should be willing to give them at least a few years (let’s say three) to let them pick up traction again. Remember, we should not look to the past year of magnificence when picking individual names from the cohort. Instead, we should look to the stocks we think could be most magnificent over the next year or two, regardless of how they’ve fared in the past quarter or year. Here are three that I think are equipped for a magnificent rest of 2024. Meta Platforms is showing no signs of losing its luster. The stock has added more than 52% in year-to-date gains to its impressive past-year surge. Even at new highs of $527 and change, I still find META stock incredibly cheap relative to its AI- and metaverse-powered growth prospects.  At writing, shares of Meta Platforms trade at 26.3 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E), not fitting my definition of an expensive stock, especially for a firm leveraging generative AI more effectively than most in its industry. Looking ahead, AI could easily continue paving the way for new highs. As more people purchase their first virtual reality headsets, perhaps Meta’s metaverse may begin to be seen as a source of strength rather than an expense builder. In any case, I wouldn’t give up on the stock here. It’s still cheap at new highs, in my books. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the Magnificent Seven companies that some critics may think should be removed from the group. I’m not one of them. The company is still innovating, perhaps at a much faster pace than investors believe. As Apple Vision Pro launches into new markets later this year, while the firm looks to finally reveal some of the finer details of its AI ambitions, perhaps it’s too soon to shed your portfolio of AAPL stock. A recent Bloomberg report suggested that Apple is looking into creating home robots after ditching its Apple Car plans. That’s an intriguing report, but not everybody’s convinced by the potential of robots to fuel growth for the tech giant. Dan Ives of Wedbush stated such a move would be a “black eye moment” for Apple. Harsh words. But I think he’s right in that Apple should be emphasizing AI more than experimenting with new hardware concepts.  Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock was the first out of the Magnificent Seven group. But whether it can work its way back in is another question entirely. I think it can, especially as Elon Musk looks to prove to the world that Tesla is not just an automobile company but a tech company on the cusp of disrupting big markets with its innovations. Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood is a Tesla believer, having picked up TSLA stock numerous times in recent months. A robotaxi event scheduled for August 8 will be a pivotal moment for Musk and the future of his electric vehicle (EV) empire as it looks to reverse course after a horrid past two years. Now down 60%, I have to say shares seem a tad too oversold, especially for those who believe that Tesla has a front-row seat to the full self-driving revolution. In short, Tesla isn’t magnificent right now. But come August, I think it could prove its doubters wrong. On the date of publication, Joey Frenette owned shares of Apple.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips You don’t have to be a daredevil to score big gains in the stock market. Sure, high-risk, high-reward plays can supercharge your portfolio if you nail the timing just right on these plays. But for investors who prefer to keep their blood pressure in check, there’s an underrated strategy that lets you have your cake and eat it too. I’m talking about buying into low-beta, high-reward stocks. These companies are essentially the best of both worlds. They provide plenty of long-term upside potential, but also are limited in terms of their downside risk. With low-beta stocks, the heavy lifting is already done by the company’s solid fundamentals. You can kick back and let compounding work its magic year after year. Of course, you’ll still want to keep some truly low-risk ballast like bonds or cash in your portfolio for balance. But why resign yourself to low single-digit returns across the board? By sprinkling in a few of these low-beta growth darlings, you can have your portfolio deliver much higher returns over the long-run. Frankly, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) is one of the most obvious picks if you’re hunting for a compounder with muted downside risk compared to the broader market, alongside the potential to deliver market-thumping returns over the long-haul. This conglomerate has both an impeccable reputation and a stellar historical track record of execution. These are two essential ingredients for keeping a stock afloat during periods of turbulence, while allowing a given stock to soar when tailwinds are blowing.  What’s not to love about Berkshire? The company has the flexibility to nimbly reallocate capital as trends and opportunities shift. Rigid index funds lack that maneuverability. Moreover, Berkshire is invested in a bevy of stalwart blue chips with incredible staying power – companies that will still be thriving decades from now. Its largest holding, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), has admittedly come under fire recently for missing the AI train. But recent leaks point to the tech titan working on a robust on-device AI solution for Siri that could deliver solid performance. And let’s not forget that Apple continues to beat Wall Street’s expectations and remains a fan favorite among Gen Z. The company’s hardware products, which include iPhones and Macs continues to see impressive growth. And Apple’s software ecosystem is still gaining market share hand over fist. But Apple is just the tip of the iceberg for Berkshire’s portfolio. The company also owns BNSF Railway, a railroad operator that would command a king’s ransom if it were a publicly-traded entity on its own. With such an incredible mix of cash-gushing businesses powered by the investment prowess of the Oracle of Omaha himself, it’s no wonder Berkshire has so consistently beaten the market. O’Reilly (NASDAQ:ORLY) is an automotive parts retailer, and I’ve been pounding the table on the auto parts sector for a while now. Why? Well, the civilian vehicle fleet has been aging at a rapid clip. The average car on the road is already a staggering 13.7 years old in 2024, and that number will likely only continue climbing. High interest rates are dissuading consumers from making big-ticket purchases that come with hefty monthly payments. That dynamic bodes very well for companies like O’Reilly, since folks are more inclined to repair and maintain their existing vehicles rather than buy new ones.  O’Reilly’s financials back up this bullish thesis too. Analysts see O’Reilly’s earnings per share rocketing from around $42 in 2024 to $111 by 2033. Revenues are projected to swell from $17 billion to $27 billion over that same stretch. With growth like that, I’d argue the stock has a lot more gas left in the tank to continue delivering stellar market-beating returns. Don’t just take my word for it though. O’Reilly has an impressive historical track record, having compounded shareholder wealth by 179% over the past five years. For a mature company operating in the decidedly un-sexy auto parts sector, that’s an astounding feat. Brown & Brown (NYSE:BRO) is an insurance broker experiencing robust growth thanks to a potent one-two punch of rising rates and an aggressive acquisition strategy. On the pricing front, the company has been able to capitalize on firming insurance premiums. That has been a boon for its business, since Brown & Brown receives commissions based on the policies its clients purchase. Plus, Brown & Brown has been actively strengthening its core business and expanding its international footprint through strategic M&A. The company’s acquisitions have allowed it to widen its moat and provide more services to its clientele base consisting mainly of small businesses. A recent peek under the hood reveals just how well this growth strategy is paying off. Brown & Brown’s organic revenue growth remains in the double-digits. Meanwhile, the company’s balance sheet is solid, with ample capital to fuel future growth.  Brown & Brown’s revenues tend to be remarkably steady, since clients need to maintain coverage through thick and thin. That quality makes it one of the low-beta, high-reward stocks that can garner market-beating returns.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips 2024 is shaping up to be a tumultuous year for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). The tech behemoth and smartphone market leaders had been forced to contend with stock price downgrades from banks following lower consumer demand, and now face a landmark lawsuit amid accusations of building an industry monopoly. Apple has firmly denied the allegations, but this has failed to stop comparisons being drawn between the firm and Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) behavior in the 1990s, which resulted in a lawsuit and requirements that the company modify its more monopolistic practices. On Wall Street, there’s already been some damage done to Apple’s stock price. The first quarter of 2024 saw AAPL tumble more than 8%, and the prospect of a costly reprimand could bring a fundamental change in the way that Apple operates which opens the door to stronger smartphone market competition. While the outcome of the lawsuit could hit Apple’s pockets, fundamental shifts in business operations could carry major ramifications for its market dominance. Should Apple be forced to make products more interoperable with other brands and provide more open services, consumers may be free to mix and match brands on an unprecedented scale. This may open the door to the following key smartphone stocks to grow into Apple’s market share:  Unlike Apple, Google parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL,NASDAQ:GOOG) has gotten off to a strong start in 2024, posting growth of around 10% in the first quarter. Back in Q4 2023, Alphabet reported its fastest quarter for revenue growth since early 2022, with sales accelerating 13% from $76.05 billion year-over-year. Despite this impressive expectation-beating performance, share prices briefly slipped due to weaker Google ad revenue. Recently, Alphabet’s stock rallied after reports suggested Google may be readying to put its artificial intelligence (AI) search services behind a paywall. Crucially, AI has been an area where Google has been quick to adopt while Apple’s interest in the emerging technology remained more hesitant. Not only could this offer a crucial fresh revenue stream for Alphabet, but it could also see AI services become a key feature of Google’s next generation of Pixel smartphones, which are readying for launch later this year. With Android as the closest rival of Apple’s iOS smartphone operating system, any challenges to the latter’s attempted smartphone industry monopoly will see Google’s market position improve. Additionally, should Apple be ordered to create cross-functionality throughout its range of smartphone products, we could see a surge in demand for Android products among iPhone users.  Another stock that outperformed Apple in Q1 2024 and could benefit from a de-monopolization of the smartphone market is South Korean firm Samsung Electronics (OTCMKTS:SSNLF). While Samsung experienced slow growth throughout the opening weeks of the year, the recent news that the tech giant could be in line to become a supplier to semiconductor leaders Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) saw a rapid 5% jump in stock value. Currently, Nvidia is testing Samsung’s new range of high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips in what may be a lucrative partnership. Samsung’s advantageous position in the global chip market recovery has seen the firm’s stock price grow of late, and many securities firms are forecasting an operating profit of over 5 trillion won ($3.7 billion) in Q1 2024, up significantly from the 640 billion won ($476 million) recorded one year prior. If these figures are achieved, they would represent Samsung’s largest operating profit since the third quarter of 2022. Samsung’s position in the smartphone market may be another cause for investor optimism in the wake of Apple’s ongoing difficulties. The firm recently revealed the Galaxy ring in January at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. With the Galaxy ring, Samsung is set to enter the smart wearables market while innovating beyond traditional smartphones.  Although it can be difficult to monitor the long-term consumer appetite for smart wearables, the fallout of Apple’s lawsuit could see the Galaxy ring win a new audience among iPhone users. Yes, Nokia ADR (NYSE:NOK) may be trading at just 5% of its market peak during the Finnish firm’s heyday at the turn of the century, but there’s still plenty for investors to be optimistic about for a stock that’s continued to defy expectations in recent years. In Q1 2024, NOKIA grew a healthy 4%, and the stock has recently earned the attention of meme investors who have sought to buy into Nokia through a sense of nostalgia and high retail investor sentiment. Despite the company’s enduring popularity, times have been tough of late for Nokia. Q4 2023 sales of 5.7 billion euros represent a 23% year-over-year decline, while operating profit dropped 27% year-on-year to 846 million euros. Nokia’s recent hardships have prompted a 600 million euro share buyback scheme in early 2024, and telecommunications operator cutbacks and a slowdown among investments in India have caused the company to forecast more difficulty over the year ahead.  These forecasts make Nokia a riskier opportunity for investors, but it’s important to note that the firm’s slowing sales have already been factored into the market, and it’s also worth highlighting that Nokia is continuing to win new admirers amid growing ‘dumb’ phone market sentiment. While it’s been hard for Nokia to compete with Android and iOS market leaders, the firm’s power of nostalgia is seeing more users opt for the app-free offerings of Nokia’s streamlined handsets. While the lure of Nokia’s meme stock status and ‘dumb’ phone popularity could help the company to outperform its expectations in 2024, it may depend on the firm’s relationship with HMD, which has long-manufactured phones for Nokia but may soon begin using its own branding. Either way, Nokia remains a stock that’s worth tracking as an unpredictable 2024 could deliver plenty of market twists and turns.

      "Remarks from Federal Reserve officials alongside new economic data significantly shaped investor sentiment over the last week. The U.S. economy continues to demonstrate resilience, with the manufacturing sector returning to expansion after 16 months of contraction and the labor market adding 303,000 new jobs in March, surpassing economist expectations. Buoyed by this positive economic momentum, recent public statements from Federal Reserve officials have tempered expectations of an imminent interest rate cut, with Fed governors reiterating the need to see more positive data on disinflation. Wall Street saw a varied performance this week, with uncertainty regarding monetary policy taking the spotlight. Energy stocks, as tracked by the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLE), notably stood out as oil prices surged to their highest levels in over six months, inching closer to $90 a barrel. Apple’s Robotics Ambition  Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is reportedly shifting its focus from electric vehicle ambitions to home robotics, reflecting its continual search for the next big innovation. Initiatives include a mobile robot and a sophisticated tabletop device with a display repositioning arm aimed at redefining smart home technology. Analysts have expressed differing opinions on the possibility of Apple venturing into the realm of personal home robots. Disney's Board Wins Vote Disney Co. (NYSE:DIS) shareholders overwhelmingly supported the company's current board, decisively defeating activist shareholder nominees from Trian and Blackwell. This result solidifies CEO Bob Iger‘s leadership as Disney aims to focus on growth, value creation and maintaining its position in the entertainment industry. Demand Overwhelms Supply  Eli Lilly Co. (NYSE:LLY) faces challenges meeting the high demand for its weight loss drugs Mounjaro and Zepbound, with shortages reported on Amazon Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) Pharmacy.

(NASDAQ:NKLA), an electric truck manufacturer, has outperformed major companies like Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Rivian Automotive Inc. (NYSE:RVN) and Lucid Group Inc. (NASDAQ:LCID) in stock performance terms so far in 2024. This growth comes after a tough 2023 for Nikola that saw stock value dips, recalls and leadership changes. Nikola’s focus on hydrogen fuel cell trucks contributes to its share price recovery, in contrast with the broader EV market’s downturn.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Laying a strong financial foundation early in life is crucial when choosing stocks for young investors. Taking advantage of the power of compounding allows even modest investments to grow significantly over extended periods. In other words, small, regular contributions can snowball into a significant nest egg over time. The historical performance of the S&P 500 index, averaging around a 10% annual return with dividends reinvested, exemplifies the wealth-creation potential of equities. Thus, the key is to invest wisely, choosing assets, especially robust stocks, with the potential for long-term growth. However, sifting through many stocks and navigating the world of ETFs can feel overwhelming. This article simplifies some of the processes, especially for young readers. Today, we’ll explore three stocks for young investors to build wealth steadily in the years ahead. Known for its unparalleled long-term track record, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) is led by the legendary investor Warren Buffett. Investors eagerly follow Berkshire Hathaway’s annual shareholder meetings, where Buffett and colleagues share sage wisdom. Over the past six decades, Berkshire Hathaway stock has appreciated at an impressive 20% compound annual growth rate, outperforming the S&P 500 by a wide margin. The power of compounding has resulted in remarkable returns for shareholders, making it a compelling choice among our stocks for young investors.  Berkshire focuses on acquiring high-quality companies with strong competitive advantages and strong balance sheets. Management released the fourth quarter and full 2023 results in late February. Net earnings came in at $17.36 per share compared with $8.24 for the same period 12 months ago. Moreover, full-year earnings per share (“EPS) for 2023 was $44.27 versus a loss of $10.33 for 2022. In addition to a jump in operating earnings, the company’s cash holding surged to record levels. So far in 2024, BRK-B stock has advanced 16%, changing hands at 21.9 times forward earnings. Meanwhile, BRK-B’s 12-month median price forecast stands at $453.61, giving an upside potential of 9% from current levels. For young investors, owning a piece of Berkshire Hathaway can be a smart move toward building long-term wealth. Leading e-commerce platform provider Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) is next among our stocks for young investors. The company benefits significantly from the sustained shift towards online shopping worldwide. Fourth quarter revenue grew 24% year-over-year (YOY) to $2.14 billion, translating to even stronger 30% growth after adjusting for the sales of its logistics businesses. Adjusted EPS also surged, reaching $0.34 compared to $0.07 in the prior-year quarter. Free cash flow more than quadrupled YOY as the company moved deeper into positive cash flow territory. E-commerce is projected to continue strong growth in the coming years, while Shopify sits at the heart of this trend, providing merchants with an all-in-one platform. Given its expanding margins, loyal customer base and commitment to innovation, analysts forecast a 35% revenue growth in 2024.  Yet, SHOP stock has lost 4% year-to-date (YTD), offering a better entry point for new investors. However, we should note that shares still command a premium at 14x trailing sales. Meanwhile, Wall Street’s 12-month price target of $85.00 suggests a potential upside of around 14% from current levels. While Shopify’s stock price will likely be volatile the rest of the year, long-term investors could regard $70 as a better entry point. As one of the most actively traded ETFs globally, the SPDR S&P 500  ETF (NYSEARCA:SPY) is the final name on our list of stocks for young investors. The SPY fund tracks the performance of the benchmark S&P 500 index, which measures the stock performance of the largest publicly-traded 500 companies stateside that make up around 80% of the overall U.S. stock market’s value. SPY offers broad exposure to these U.S. businesses’ growth and profitability potential, mitigating single-stock concentration risk. Due to its capitalization-weighted structure, large, well-established firms hold a substantial weighting within the index, influencing their overall performance. Launched in 1993 as the first US-listed ETF, SPY holds over $530 billion in assets. The five largest names in SPY include  Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), accounting for a quarter of the fund’s roster. SPY has gained 8% YTD, while the fund’s top 10 holdings have significantly outperformed the broader market. Yet, the current valuation appears slightly expensive, with trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-book (P/B) ratios of 22.0 and 4.5, respectively. A potential decline towards $500 or below during the upcoming earnings season would mean a more opportune entry point for long-term investors.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips When Warren Buffett buys a stock he tends to move decisively. It doesn’t mean all of the companies will be massive purchases like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) turned into, hogging up 45% of Berkshire Hathaway‘s (NYSE:BRK-A)(NYSE:BRK-B) portfolio. Instead, he will take meaningful positions, whether it’s dollars spent or as a sizeable percentage of the company’s. Buffett doesn’t hesitate to spend billions of dollars on a company he favors, though. While you likely can’t do that in your own portfolio, following his lead on his purchases still makes sense. In the six decades Buffett has helmed Berkshire Hathaway, he has generated returns of 4.38 million percent for investors compared to 32,000% for the S&P 500. Those are investments worth emulating! So if you want to ride his coattails, these are the three best Warren Buffett stocks to buy in April Buffett only bought three stocks in the fourth quarter. One of them was oil company Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY). In his annual letter to shareholders, the Oracle of Omaha extolled the praises of CEO Vicki Hollub. He wrote that under her capable leadership, “Occidental is doing the right things for both its country and its owners.”  Now investors actually have a choice of oil companies to buy as one of the other three stocks he bought was Chevron (NYSE:CVX). I own the integrated oil and gas giant in my own portfolio but I find Occidental a compelling purchase at these prices. The Permian basin specialist trades at a discount to its larger peer on both a price-to-earnings and price-to-free cash (FCF) basis. That means investors are getting a bargain on the profits Occidental makes as well as on the excess cash it generates. It’s also notable that at the end of 2023, Berkshire Hathaway owned 27.8% of the oil stock. It has SEC permission to buy as much as half of Occidental. And while increasing his stake is possible, Buffett was clear he had no intention of buying the whole thing. “Though we very much like our ownership, as well as the option [to materially increase its stake], Berkshire has no interest in purchasing or managing Occidental,” he wrote. Although American Express (NYSE:AXP) wasn’t one of the stocks Buffett bought last quarter, the credit card giant still holds a considerable portion of his heart. Enough to call out the stock in the shareholder letter. He pointed out that as good as the company is, in the past it has gone off the rails. It tried to enter verticals not related to its wheelhouse and failed spectacularly. It was also mismanaged. Buffett underscored, though, that is “definitely” not the case now.  Yet owning a stock even if you don’t buy more shares is a declaration of support for the business. And the company rewarded him (and other investors) for his devotion by increasing its earnings and dividends. AmEx is likely to increase its payout this year by 16%. For the past decade, the credit card leader has raised the dividend by a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 11%. Equally important, FCF has grown at an 8.5% CAGR. With an FCF payout ratio of just 10%, there is plenty of room for additional dividends and growth along the lines of what Buffett is expecting for the coming year. Here you’re getting a five-for-one deal. Buffett owns five Japanese banking giants, each of which was worthy of being mentioned in the annual letter. They are are Itochu (OTCMKTS:ITOCF) (OTCMKTS:ITOCY), Marubeni (OTCMKTS:MARUF),  Mitsubishi (OTCMKTS:MSBHF), Mitsui (OTCMKTS:MITSF), and Sumitomo (OTCMKTS:SSUMF) (OTCMKTS:SSUMY). These are also investments Buffett is all too willing to be a passive, long-term owner of. While he increased his stake in them last year after visiting with the management of each, Buffett said he promised them he would not increase his ownership interest beyond 9.9% of outstanding shares. Berkshire Hathaway now controls about 9% of the shares of each, so don’t expect to see him buying much more. That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t buy them. Buffett highlighted how management not only was not as aggressive as their United States counterparts in lining their own pockets but they were all far more shareholder-friendly than U.S. bank managers.  Only about 5% of the banks’ earnings are allocated to dividends. They prefer to allocate more towards building their businesses and repurchasing shares. That’s value creation Buffett admires and you should, too. On the date of publication, Rich Duprey held a LONG position in CVX stock.

      "News broke recently that Google (NASDAQ:GOOL) was in talks with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to integrate its Gemini AI into iPhones. The deal would be a huge boon for Google as it would likely be very lucrative, while also enhancing the reputation of the company’s AI, which has previously been plagued with public image issues. For Apple, it would allow the company and its products to stay ahead of the AI curve. When OpenAI released ChatGPT 3 to the public at the end of 2022, it set off an arms race in Silicon Valley. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is partnered with OpenAI and is the current king of the hill; the company's stock is up almost 50% in a year. Apple and Google, on the other hand, have struggled to keep up. Google, in a rush to keep up with Microsoft, released its answer to ChatGPT, Bard. Rebranded to Gemini, Google's AI platform has been plagued with issues. Prone to hallucinations, the LLM has been a flop up to this point. Apple has fared even worse. The once-largest company lacks an AI platform altogether. How the innovative tech behemoth was caught so unaware can only be speculated on, but the damage to Apple's image is real. The company's stock is up less than 4% in a year while the market is up nearly 30%. Although the details are still being hammered out, a deal between these two companies would be a huge boost for both. Google's stock jumped 5% on the day the news broke and is up another 3% since. Apple's stock had a more modest 0.5% bump on the day but has continued to slide since, due to other bad news coming from the company.  For Google or Apple bulls excited by the news, Direxion offers the Direxion Daily GOOGL Bull 2X Shares (NYSE:GGLL) and the Direxion Daily AAPL Bull 2X Shares (NYSE:AAPU) which seek daily investment results, before fees and expenses, of 200% of the performance of the Class A shares of Alphabet Inc. and the common shares of Apple Inc., respectively. For the bears, Direxion offers the Direxion Daily GOOGL Bear 1X Shares (NYSE:GGLS) and the Direxion Daily AAPL Bear 1X Shares (NYSE:AAPD) which seek daily investment results, before fees and expenses, of 100% of the inverse of the performance of the Class A shares of Alphabet Inc. and the common shares of Apple Inc., respectively.

      "With interest rates remaining at their highest levels in over two decades, and with U.S. Treasury bonds comfortably exceeding a 4% yield, an increasing number of investors are turning their attention to the realm of corporate bonds. In this landscape, they seek not only promising yield opportunities but also the strategic advantage of diversifying away from equity investments. The Financial Times recently reported that inflows into corporate bond funds have surged to $22.8 billion in 2024, marking the first positive start to a year since 2019. Corporate bonds come in two main types: investment-grade and high-yield. Investment-grade bonds are issued by financially stable companies, while high-yield (or speculative grade) bonds come from riskier firms but offer higher returns. Rating agencies like S&P, Fitch and Moody’s determine which category a bond falls into based on the issuer’s ability to repay debts. Ratings range from AAA (very safe) to D (in default).  For example, companies like Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Eli Lilly Company (NYSE:LLY) and Walt Disney Co. (NYSE:DIS) are rated as investment grade. Conversely, firms like AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. (NYSE:AMC), Office Property Income Trust (NYSE:OPI) and Navient Corporation (NASDAQ:NAVI) belong to the speculative-grade world. Read also: Top 10 US High-Yield Corporate Bonds With Returns Over 20% In April 2024 The cutoff between investment-grade and high-yield is at the BB+ rating. Anything below BB+ is considered high yield, while BBB- or higher is investment-grade. In general, the riskier the bond, the higher the potential return. Investment-grade bonds tend to offer lower yields because they are safer bets, with stronger financial health and better chances of repayment.  However, even within the realm of investment-grade bonds, there are opportunities to find attractive yields from companies with solid fundamentals. This allows investors to earn better returns without taking on excessive risk, compared to investing solely in ultra-safe U.S. Treasuries. Benzinga used the Public.com bond screener to discover which investment-grade corporate bonds offer the best yield as of April 2024.

The goal here is to increase the performance of its “mission-critical and public safety networks.” GCT Semiconductor CEO John Schlaefer said the following about the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed with Aramco: “We look forward to working with Aramco and leveraging our advanced 4G and 5G capabilities with future-focused AI-driven modem features to help develop the local ecosystem and provide reliable and fast communication for their key applications in Saudi Arabia and the broader region.”  A focus of this collaboration will be chipsets and modules for LTE, 5G and the NTN spectrum. This will allow for the “localization of wireless end-user devices and IoT manufacturing” in Saudi Arabia. GCTS stock is experiencing heavy trading on Friday following its deal with Armaco.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Cinemark (NYSE:CNK) stock is in the news Friday after the movie theater chain was granted a rare double upgrade from Wells Fargo analyst Steven Cahall. Wells Fargo bumped shares of CNK stock up from an “underweight” rating to an “overweight” rating. That’s worth noting as the analyst consensus rating for CNK shares is a hold based on 10 opinions. To go along with that upgrade, Cahall increased the firm’s price target for CNK stock from $13 per share to $23. That’s a potential upside of 22.7% over its previous closing price. It’s also above the analyst consensus price prediction of $18.40 per share. Here’s what the Wells Fargo analysts had to say about Cinemark in a note to clients obtained by StreetInsider:  “Q1 DBO came in 6% above our est. The beat wasn’t on a breakout performance, instead, several films outperformed — a sign that consumer demand is robust w/ legs to next year.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips In a new SEC filing, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) revealed that it had laid off over 600 of its employees after abandoning its Apple Car project. The job cuts were Apple’s largest since the peak of the pandemic. In the wake of the news, Apple and AAPL stock are attracting a great deal of attention today. According to documents filed with California regulators, Apple’s job cuts will be implemented starting on May 27. Although the firm did not provide any details about which workers were given pink slips, the Apple layoffs were disclosed shortly after the tech giant decided to terminate its autonomous electric vehicle project. Consequently, there is a great deal of speculation that most of the dismissed employees were working on the now-defunct EV project. However, some of the workers who had been involved with the EV initiative are now helping to develop Apple’s AI systems.  The iPhone maker is considering getting involved in developing “home robotics” products, Bloomberg reported on April 3. Specifically, the firm has explored creating a robot that can accompany consumers in their homes as well as a stationary home assistant, the news service stated. On March 21, the Department of Justice sued Apple, alleging that the firm had developed “an illegal monopoly in the smartphone market.” Specifically, the regulator alleges that AAPL has taken steps to prevent competition from arising and then uses the lack of competition to hike prices on its products. On a positive note, investment bank Evercore recently reported that AAPL’s revenue from its App Store jumped a higher-than-expected 13% last month compared to March 2023. Heading into today, AAPL stock had retreated 1.5% in the previous five days and was down 12.3% so far in 2024.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Augmented reality (AR), still in its early stages, is set to grow rapidly as recent innovations bring new products to market and ultimately reduce costs. Estimating the market value of augmented reality is challenging, yet conservative predictions suggest it could reach up to $58 billion by 2028, with $38 billion in sales expected this year alone. That growth makes AR stocks a hot opportunity to capitalize on long-term tech trends still in their relative infancy. With the emergence of any new technology, a flood of new companies, startups and innovators are entering the market, seeking investor attention. But not all will succeed. For those interested in strong buy AR stocks, sticking with well-known, reputable companies is the safest bet today. Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), a leading augmented reality manufacturer, is unlikely to allow new market entrants or current competitors to usurp its position. Its collaborative effort with Samsung and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) reinforces its dominance in hardware and signals a promising future as the augmented reality markets evolve. The partnership plans to develop a comprehensive mixed-reality platform, capitalizing on Qualcomm’s technological expertise, Samsung’s hardware prowess and Google’s investments in augmented reality tools. While we’re waiting for a definitive product announcement, industry analysts predict the collaboration will result in a series of headsets offering novel virtual reality experiences, which could significantly boost Qualcomm’s revenue.  In addition, Qualcomm is continuously upgrading its broad virtual reality product array, including headsets. Equipped with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon processor, these products feature the most advanced WiFi technology and eye-tracking capabilities, driving forward innovation in the augmented reality domain and setting new benchmarks for the industry. Though a ways off from its past $3 trillion market cap, Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) ventures into augmented reality remain a top prospect for investors looking for strong buy AR stocks. The company has impressively sold as many as 200,000 Vision Pro headsets already, despite its hefty $3,499 price tag. Sales are expected to increase as the product’s capabilities become evident to early adopters, and the cost of units eventually declines. A potential issue on the horizon is the possibility of the Vision Pro cannibalizing sales from other Apple products, particularly tablets and iPads, which are already experiencing a sales decline. Apple finds itself at a pivotal moment, anticipating the stabilization of Vision Pro sales and determining whether this new hardware and augmented reality technology will be a temporary trend or replicate the groundbreaking impact of the iPod in the mid-2000s. Regardless, Apple currently stands as the leading augmented reality stock, making it an excellent choice for investors seeking a blue-chip entry into the burgeoning market. Meta (NASDAQ:META) closely trails Apple but might soon overtake it as a leader in the augmented reality (AR) market. A major consumer review has placed Apple’s Vision Pro and Meta’s Quest Pro on equal footing, rating them both at four stars. However, Quest Pro’s much lower price point positions the product not merely as a cheaper alternative to Apple’s but as a cost-effective innovator independent of the brand-name weight Apple carries. That distinction makes Meta a compelling AR stock option. Beyond the Quest Pro, Mark Zuckerberg and his team are reportedly working on projects that could significantly impact their AR efforts. In mid-January, Zuckerberg announced significant investments in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) chips. The move supports Meta’s AI development and suggests a major commitment to building a “massive compute infrastructure” likely to enhance AR platforms, particularly with AI integration.  Matching Apple in the realm of blue-chip AR stocks, Meta represents a reliable investment to tap into emerging trends within the developing AR sector.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Could Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) get kicked out of the elite “Magnificent Seven” club this year? Apple is no longer a market darling. We’ve assigned a “D” grade to Apple stock due to company problems. Apple is a reputable brand that has delivered shareholder value. AAPL stock has been underperforming in 2024 compared to other “Mag-7” stocks. Apple’s current situation is not as “magnificent” as it seems, feel free to explore other technology firms. Large-cap technology stocks generally did well in this year’s first quarter. Yet, Apple stock declined 7.63% in 2024’s first three months. Does this mean there’s a terrific buying opportunity with AAPL stock? Not necessarily. Apple is having issues in China, and this could help to explain why the market is losing confidence in Apple.  Here’s a startling statistic about Apple. Believe it or not, iPhone shipments plummeted by approximately 33% year over year in February. This is important, as $72.6 billion of Apple’s $383.3 billion in 2023 total revenue came from China sales. China is crucial to Apple, but the company appears to be having trouble selling its smartphones there. Reportedly, in the first six weeks of 2024, iPhone sales declined 24% YOY. If Apple isn’t able to solve this problem soon, there could be implications for the company’s top-line and bottom-line results. Even for a giant company like Apple, waging a battle against the U.S. government is a gargantuan task. Yet, Apple is evidently embroiled in a headline-grabbing lawsuit brought by a powerful government entity. Here’s the lowdown. As Yahoo! Finance reported recently, the U.S. Justice Department has filed a lawsuit against Apple based on antitrust allegations.  Attorney General Merrick Garland accused Apple of maintaining “its power not because of its superiority, but because of its unlawful exclusionary behavior.” The idea behind the lawsuit is that allegation that Apple makes it practically impossible for competitors’ apps and devices to succeed. However, Apple has reportedly vowed to fight the Justice Department’s antitrust lawsuit. Is it a good move for Apple to push back against U.S. regulators? Only time will tell, but it’s almost a certainty that Apple will have to expend time, effort and capital to fight this lawsuit. Plus, Apple may sustain reputational damage along the way. This year so far, AAPL stock has been stuck in a rut even while some other technology stock have raced ahead. Meanwhile, Apple’s iPhone-delivery slowdown in China is a major cause for concern. Meanwhile, Apple’s battle with U.S. antitrust regulators could be protracted and costly. Therefore, Apple stock isn’t necessarily a bargain just because it’s down; we’re calling it “cheap for a reason” and giving the stock a not-so-magnificent “D” grade today.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips China is a conundrum. With 900 million people, the country is the world’s biggest consumer market and United States companies love tapping into it. Whether it’s a new expansion opportunity or just a way to stave off slowing growth in more mature and saturated markets, companies eagerly do business there. Yet it’s problematic, too. Just ask these tech stock titans. Foremost is China’s use of slave labor. Human Rights Watch says the government uses Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslim communities in forced labor camps. Products including car parts, solar panels and apparel from businesses such as PDD Holdings‘ (NASDAQ:PDD) Temu and Schein are regularly sold in the U.S. And American companies as wide-ranging as Nike (NYSE:NKE) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) have endured scrutiny for tainting their supply chains by using forced labor products. The ongoing war in Ukraine also helped raise tensions between Washington and Beijing that spilled over into trade issues. President Biden imposed restrictions on the sale of semiconductors and advanced technology to China which retaliated with restrictions of its own. Not just in computer chips but by subsidizing local companies to challenge sales by U.S. corporations. Other businesses are simply prohibited from operating there. Twitter and Facebook are two companies banned over free speech fears. These three tech stocks facing China challenges face very high hurdles to spur sales growth.  One of the most high-profile fallouts from heightened trade tensions is China blocking Intel‘s (NASDAQ:INTC) chips from beiung used in government computers and servers. Reminiscent of the arguments U.S. politicians are using to ban TikTok or force its sale, China issued a list of “safe and reliable” CPUs, databases and operating systems companies could use. The products were all from Chinese companies. Also caught up in the ban are chips from Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Microsoft‘s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Windows operating system. But it’s a heavy blow to Intel, which was looking to China expansion to revitalize its growth efforts. Nearly 75% of Intel’s revenue comes from outside the U.S. China represents 27% of the chipmaker’s $54.2 billion total revenue, or almost $15 billion. The country also represents 15% of Advanced Micro’s $23 billion revenues. Intel’s stock is down 23% year to date as a result of disappointing guidance issued earlier this year. As trade war hawks in both political parties rail against China in an election year, don’t expect INTC stock to run much higher. It’s not just in the U.S. where the fervor for electric vehicles (EV) is subsiding. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) saw its market share in China slip to 6.6% in the first two months of 2024 from 7.6% last year as overall EV sales slowed. Coupled with increased competition from Chinese manufacturers like BYD (OTCMKTS:BDDYF), Nio (NYSE:NIO) and Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI), the going is getting tough for Tesla.  The EV maker reported first-quarter deliveries tumbled 8.5% to 386,810 vehicles where analysts had expected 457,000 deliveries. It also marked a 20% slide in sales sequentially. However, Tesla’s consolation prize was regaining the title of world’s largest EV maker after BYD reported deliveries plummeted 43% to 300,411 vehicles. All EV manufacturers are now locked in a price-cutting war that will likely decimate profits for the companies. Tesla slashed prices on its Model 3 and Model Y cars in China earlier this year. It also began offering cash discounts on Model Ys beginning Feb. 1. Now the EV maker is offering additional incentives on cars in China, including insurance, paint colors and financing options. It’s likely its rivals will respond as they did to Tesla’s earlier buyer enticements. Tesla stock is down 34% year-to-date and could go lower as sales slow and discounting heats up. Drop this and the other tech stock titans we mentioned. The third tech stock facing China challenges is Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). It saw iPhone shipments tumble 33% in February, according to Bloomberg News. There were only 2.4 million devices shipped that month but the number was affected by China’s Lunar New Year holiday. As Apple is the only cross-border company with a sizable market share in China, it bore the brunt of the decline. The tech giant has been working overtime to smooth relations in the country. CEO Tim Cook recently traveled to China to meet with government officials and open a new flagship store in Shanghai. He promised to increase Apple’s investment in China in the long run. With the new iPhone 16 due out later this year, Cook wants to ensure the road to sales is paved before its debut.  Apple also recently reached a $490 million settlement with plaintiffs in a class-action lawsuit. They alleged Cook lied to shareholders in 2019 by concealing just how bad the iPhone was selling in China. Apple surprised the market by slashing quarterly revenue forecasts by $9 billion on declining demand in China. The situation is emblematic of the ongoing difficulty U.S. companies face when doing business there. Apple stock is down 12% so far this year. This and the other tech stock titans we have mentioned need to be dropped soon.

According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, Apple's vision for the future could include an autonomous robot butler that would assist users at home. The company has redirected resources from its abandoned car project towards creating a mobile, in-home robot. One of the projects being worked on is a mobile robot that would follow users around their homes. The other is an advanced tabletop device that uses robotics to move a display around. Bloomberg's sources, who are employees familiar with the matter, have said that Apple's hardware engineering division and AI group are leading the robotics work. The project is overseen by AI head John Giannandrea and home product executives Matt Costello and Brian Lynch. Apple's home robot could potentially compete with Amazon's Astro, which is a mobile virtual assistant that provides home security monitoring.  As for the table-top device, Gurman has said that one concept is for the device's display to mimic the head movements of a person on a FaceTime video call. However, Apple has encountered technical challenges related to balancing the weight of a robotic motor on a small stand, and some Apple executives have debated whether to develop such a device. These robotics projects are still in the initial stages of research, and it is unclear whether any of them will be released to the public.\n"

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips While Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock continues to grab headlines for being the single-biggest loser so far in 2024, there’s one major investor who thinks the electric vehicle (EV) maker is due for a recovery: Cathy Wood. The Ark Invest manager believes that Tesla’s more than 30% drawdown is just a road bump before CEO Elon Musk’s brainchild soars to new highs. How high you might ask? Wood has a $2,000 price target on TSLA stock. For context, the stock currently trades for $171 per share. Wood recently discussed her optimism for Tesla, arguing that the company is still positioned strongly for the all-electric future. “Now is not the time to run for the hills,” Wood said in an interview with CNBC.  Ark Invest recently bought up millions of dollars worth of Tesla ahead of the company’s first-quarter earnings call last week. Unfortunately, the company’s financial results were nothing short of disappointing, further digging Tesla into the red. Still, Wood believes that Tesla’s future is bright. The fund manager thinks that Tesla will hit its stride when it eventually rolls out its robotaxi business, which she estimates could contribute to $10 trillion in revenue by 2030. Wood is a long-time Tesla fan, having once maintained a price target of $5,000 per share for TSLA stock. Despite Wood’s faith, much of Wall Street has abandoned Tesla. Indeed, the EV maker has already shed more than $240 billion in value in 2024, with some analysts even claiming that the “Magnificent Seven” is now the “Fab Four,” cutting Tesla, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) from the roster. Not for nothing, Tesla has largely failed to meet expectations this year. In its recently posted Q1 financial results, the company announced a year-over-year (YOY) decline in global vehicle deliveries — for the first time since 2020.  The company has seen a sharp pullback in EV demand, attributable to a number of possible headwinds, including increased competition in China. “[It] was a messy first quarter,” noted Guggenheim Securities analyst Ronald Jewsikow. “The demand is slowing, China competition is strong, and then Europe hasn’t grown for five quarters now for Tesla. Structurally, there’s emerging risks in all three regions that, even as we move beyond a very messy first quarter earnings result, there’s reasons for concern.” Whether this once-upon-a-time EV darling reclaims its seat among new tech giants, remains to be seen.

      "(RTTNews) - Dummy photos of Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 16 models were leaked on social media platforms, showing some additional features on the models such as a capture button, vertical rear camera and action button. The images, posted by Sonny Dickson, on X/Twitter showed dummy models of the iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Pro, iPhone 16 Plus, and iPhone 16 Pro Max. Dummy models, made from aluminum, are usually used by accessory makers to visualize about the final product. The leaked images showed that the latest Capture button will feature on the right side of all the models, which can be used to quickly capture videos and photos. It also showed a vertical rear camera array on iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus models, instead of the existing diagonal rear camera feature introduced with the iPhone 13 model.  Also, it indicated that all four models of iPhone 16 will be equipped with an Action button on the left side of the device. The button was initially introduced on the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max models to replace the mute switch and launch shortcuts. Moreover, the display size of the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max was shown to have increased from 6.1- to 6.3 inches and 6.7- to 6.9 inches, respectively. The tech giant's most-awaited iPhone 16 is expected to be launched in this fall. The company is expected to share more information about the models at WWDC 2024 to be held in June.\n",
      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Investment managers tend to flock to a select group of outperforming stocks that drive consistent returns. The stocks top money managers can’t live without generally hail from sectors like technology, healthcare and consumer staples. However, tech reigns supreme, hosting stocks that permeate most portfolios. In particular, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) represent core technology holdings found among an overwhelming majority of money managers. For instance, Apple constitutes Warren Buffett’s top position at Berkshire Hathaway, making up over 40% of its holdings. Meanwhile, Ken Fisher, Mairs and Power, Philippe Laffont’s Coatue Management and Fidelity’s Contrafund all share top stakes in Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon as well. Exciting AI and metaverse plays like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) entice more risk-tolerant managers. However, Microsoft, Appl and Amazon remain the cherished stocks top money managers can’t live without thanks to their dominant positions and immense growth runways in cloud computing, e-commerce and beyond. This article explores why these big tech companies represent such a significant allocation across top investment managers’ portfolios. With its strong fundamentals and competitive edge, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is undoubtedly one of the stocks top money managers can’t live without. As many portfolio managers have wisely realized, Microsoft is exceptionally positioned for long-term outperformance. This is especially obvious when taking into account the near monopoly the company holds across some of the company’s key business segments.  Powering Microsoft’s success is its cloud dominance. The tech titan’s robust cloud platform remains unrivaled, fueling its Q2 2024 revenue growth to $62 billion, up 18% year-over-year. Such financial strength confirms Microsoft’s near monopoly status in major tech sectors. Plus, with sturdy operating income up 33% to $27 billion for the quarter, Microsoft has the backing to continue expanding its cloud, AI and metaverse lead. Adding to its upside potential, Microsoft is making big metaverse moves — evidenced by its monumental $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard last October. This deal fortifies Microsoft’s supremacy in gaming while allowing for tremendous metaverse monetization ahead. With gaming revenue already up 61% in Q2 2024, Microsoft is clearly on track to deliver metaverse profits down the road. Given its cloud dominance, metaverse momentum and exceptional growth metrics this quarter, Microsoft epitomizes one of the key stocks top money managers can’t live without for both present returns and future-forward gains. Its coveted brand and dominant position in consumer technology make Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) one of the favored stocks top money managers can’t live without. The iPhone maker continues to ride on hardware sales and services revenue, surpassing Wall Street estimates. In its latest earnings report for the first quarter of fiscal 2024, ending Dec. 31, 2023, Apple posted over $119 billion in quarterly revenue, an increase of 2% YoY. Fueled by robust iPhone demand during the holiday season, Apple even faced supply chain constraints that limited sales growth. Still, the results beat expectations. This resilience confirms why Apple remains a favorite among institutional investors and top money managers.  Bolstering its hardware ecosystem further, Apple recently unveiled a mixed-reality headset called Vision Pro in January 2024. The $3,499 premium device with both AR and VR capabilities targets creative professionals and showcases Apple’s ambitions in futuristic technologies. Although niche for now, it expands Apple’s total addressable market. With immense brand loyalty and an installed base exceeding 1.8 billion active devices globally, Apple retains pricing power and stable revenues. Top money managers see these qualities as enduring competitive strengths no matter the economic climate. Additionally, Apple’s services segment hit an all-time revenue record of $23.1 billion last quarter, up 11%. Offerings like Apple Music, iCloud, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade and more drive this high-margin recurring revenue stream. Such resilience makes Apple one of the stocks top money managers can’t live without, even amidst market uncertainty. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has firmly established itself as one of the stocks top money managers can’t live without thanks to its dominant position in global e-commerce and cloud computing. The company reported staggering net sales of $574.8 billion in 2023, up 12% year-over-year. Operating income also soared to $36.9 billion, triple that of the previous year. Driving this growth is Amazon’s core online retail segment, which continues to make up a significant portion of total sales. However, its true crown jewel is Amazon Web Services (AWS) — the company’s cloud computing arm. AWS raked in revenue of $91 billion in 2023, with operating margins hitting a superb 30%. With the global cloud market expected to hit $1.6 trillion by 2030, AWS provides an immense growth runway. Geographically, too, Amazon still has plenty of room to expand. Online shopping only accounts for 16% of total U.S. retail sales, a number that Amazon has greatly influenced. By securing nearly 40% of all U.S. e-commerce spending, Amazon is poised to benefit tremendously as more shopping moves online. Given these outstanding fundamentals and growth prospects, it is no wonder that money managers view Amazon as a core long-term holding. Nearly every major mutual fund has a sizable stake in Amazon stock. With dominant positions in two high-growth markets, Amazon remains undoubtedly one of the stocks top money managers can’t live without.

      "(RTTNews) - Apple (AAPL) announced that it has successfully fixed an outage issue on its App Store on iOS and MacOS devices.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Ken Fisher of Fisher Asset Management comes from investing royalty. His father, Philip Fisher, wrote the investment classic “Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits” and whom Morningstar called “one of the great investors of all time.” He was a long-term, buy-and-hold investor who, like Warren Buffett, believed the best time to sell a stock was “almost never.” Many of those attributes were passed down to his son, who manages $265 billion in assets under management (AUM). Despite its size, Fisher Asset Management has notched some impressive gains over the past decade. The firm’s 10-year annual returns are north of 58%, while over the last five years, Fisher returned 63%. In just the last 12 months he is up to 24%. Although he has a large portfolio containing well over 900 companies, these are the three stocks dominating this investing icon’s portfolio today. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) recently slipped to fifth place as the most valuable company in Fisher’s portfolio, but its performance so far this year has been stellar. AMZN stock is up 20% year to date and more than 76% higher over the past year.  Because the online retailer is so integral to the economy, it was added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average. It’s not just because of its e-commerce platform but also its cloud services business, which provides the backbone for the internet presence of numerous companies. And it continues to improve itself. Cost-cutting measures and integration of artificial intelligence (AI) are paying benefits to Amazon. Strong revenue and better profit margins over the past few quarters are just some of the tangible results of its efforts. Perhaps most notable is the surge in advertising revenue, up 27% last quarter to $14.7 billion. It is already the third-largest ad platform behind Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). Fisher owns 41.8 million shares of Amazon stock worth $7.6 billion, making it the fourth-largest position in his portfolio at 3.7% of the total. With an average purchase price of around $54 per share, Fisher has seen his investment more than triple in value. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the biggest position Fisher owns. It represents 5% of his portfolio. Few stocks are as closely associated with AI as Microsoft. Having integrated OpenAI’s ChatGPT generative AI technology into all aspects of its operations, the tech giant is receiving significant dividends. AI contributed 600 basis points of growth to Microsoft’s Azure cloud services business last quarter, double what it had done just one quarter prior. It is also helping Microsoft land more and bigger deals for longer contractual periods of time.  Clients like Azure. It allows them to grow their transition to the cloud at their own pace. The hybrid environment lets them choose the level of service they want and where they want it. They can choose between on-premises, in the cloud or a combination of both. Expect to see AI’s growth rate and contribution to Microsoft accelerate in the coming quarters. Fisher owns 25.4 million shares of MSFT stock worth $10.7 billion. He’s generated gains of 291% so far with his average purchase price of $107 per share. The No. two holding in Fisher Asset Management is Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Despite all the headwinds the consumer electronics stock faces, Apple has tripled Fisher’s investment from the average buy-in price of $51 per share. Yet the headwinds are legion. Most notable is the Justice Dept. suing Apple for antitrust violations. Although some of the allegations seem ludicrous, such as operating a monopoly when it has but a 57% share of the domestic smartphone market, it will be a distraction for management as it fights back against the charges. Apple also has its work cut out for it in China, one of its biggest markets but also one that has seen sales slow dramatically. Its iPhone sales reportedly plummeted 33% in China in January and February, according to Bloomberg News. Of course, March tends to be the strongest month of the three in the quarter, so we will need to see how the iPhone fared then.  The consumer tech leader has its next iteration of the smartphone coming out later this year. The iPhone 16 should also have some form of Google’s own AI technology accessible so it could be a big seller. Apple stock is down 9% year-to-date, but no one suggests the party is over by a long shot.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Microchip and semiconductor concern Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has led the market ever since the current rally began in autumn 2022. Its run has been incredible. Since October 2022, NVDA stock has increased 695%. The company’s share price has risen an astounding 1,765% over the last five years. The growth has pushed Nvidia’s market capitalization to above $2 trillion and made it the third largest publicly traded company in the world after Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). The key to the success of NVDA stock has been the rising demand for the company’s chips and semiconductors, which are used to power artificial intelligence models and applications. The massive worldwide demand has led to a surge in Nvidia’s sales and profits. For the final quarter of 2023, Nvidia reported that its sales increased 265% from a year earlier and its profits grew 769% year over year. The company’s earnings reports have become a highly anticipated and closely watched event across the entire stock market. So who will be the next Nvidia? Which companies are positioned to steal its crown? Here are three AI stocks that will leave Nvidia in the dust. Shares of Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) are running circles around Nvidia right now. MU stock has risen by 34% in the past month after the company announced financial results that beat Wall Street forecasts and provided upbeat forward guidance driven by AI demand. Micron, which makes memory and storage for computers and specializes in USB flash drives, announced in March earnings per share of 42 cents compared to a loss of 25 cents that was expected among analysts who cover the company.  Revenue amounted to $5.82 billion versus $5.35 billion, which was expected on Wall Street. Management said the company is benefitting from the current AI boom, with demand for its memory and computer data storage products rising. Micron provides memory and storage for new AI systems around the world. Looking ahead, executives said they expect to report revenue of $6.60 billion for the just-completed first quarter, which is above the $6.02 billion that was expected by analysts. Thanks to its post-earnings bounce, MU stock has now been up 55% since the start of this year and has more than doubled over the last 12 months. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is nipping at Nvidia’s heels. One of its most direct competitors, AMD, as the company is known, has developed a series of microchips specifically for AI models and applications that it hopes will rival Nvidia’s chips and semiconductors. Last December, AMD unveiled a new series of microchips called the “Ryzen 8040” that are aimed at boosting AI applications by up to 60%. Those new chips will be incorporated into laptops and personal computers (PCs). AMD has also launched the new MI300X accelerator microchip that’s used in data centers and servers and competes against Nvidia’s AI data center chips. Companies ranging from Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) to Microsoft have been buying up the MI300X chips, and AMD executives have said that they expect the data center microchips to generate $2 billion in sales for all of this year. The new AI microchips and decent earnings have AMD stock up 87% over the last 12 months, including a 30% gain so far in 2024. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (NYSE:TSM) is arguably the most important company to Nvidia and the entire AI industry. This is because TSMC, as the company is popularly known, makes three-quarters (75%) of the microchips in the world, including those designed by Nvidia, as well as nearly all the chips and semiconductors that power AI technologies. The growing importance of TSMC to the AI and chip industries has its stock up by 52% in the last year, including a 39% year-to-date gain.  During their most recent earnings call, TSMC executives said that the company is well-positioned to capture current and future growth opportunities, especially related to AI. Taiwan Semiconductor is increasingly focused on AI chips and semiconductors as it executes a global expansion plan. The company recently opened its first microchip plant in Japan, moving beyond its home market in Taiwan. It is also developing two new microchip plants in Arizona at a cost of $40 billion. TSM stock has more than tripled over the last five years. On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in NVDA and MSFT.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) became the first company to reach the trillion-dollar milestone. A few years later, Apple had company. Most Magnificent Seven stocks have valuations exceeding $1 trillion, and other stocks look poised to join them. The $1 trillion valuation implies sizable gains for the investments on this list. The jump may require a 30% to 50% increase for these promising tech stocks. Some of them have the potential to become trillion-dollar stocks by the end of the year, while others may reach the milestone by 2030. These are some of the top tech stocks set to join the trillion-dollar club. Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is the easiest choice on this list. The semiconductor giant has the largest market cap of these picks and comes in with a $633 billion market cap. The company’s 50 P/E ratio and artificial intelligence (AI) tailwinds can give it the extra momentum it needs to attain trillion-dollar status.  The stock is surrounded by enthusiasts, as it is currently rated a Strong Buy. The lowest price target still implies some upside, while the average price target indicates a 16% gain is in the cards. The highest price target of $1,720 per share suggests the stock could gain an additional 26% from current levels. Broadcom’s recent acquisition of VMware has already translated into higher revenue growth. Revenue increased by 34% year-over-year (YoY), and the company believes it can exceed $50 billion in fiscal 2024 revenue. The corporation helped itself toward this goal by repurchasing $8.29 billion worth of shares. Visa (NYSE:V) is a fintech company that offers credit and debit cards. The company makes a small percentage of every credit and debit card transaction. Many investors use Visa’s financial reports as an indicator of broader U.S. economic performance. Visa gave its investors and broader market participants reasons to cheer in its latest earnings report. Revenue increased by 9% YoY in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. GAAP net income was up by 17% YoY, reaching $4.9 billion. Those growth rates helped the company bring in a 56.6% net profit margin. Visa stock is up by 76% over the past five years and has momentum on its side. The stock is up 7% year-to-date and 21% over the past year. The stock trades at a $572 billion market cap, more than halfway toward the trillion-dollar milestone. Visa shares trade at a 32 P/E ratio and offer a 0.75% yield.  Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) would have to more than quadruple to reach a $1 trillion market cap, so investors will have to be very patient with this one. The stock has a $224 billion market cap and a 48 P/E ratio. Shares are up by 86% over the past five years. Adobe generates recurring revenue from its popular software products. Creatives and businesses use Adobe’s products to create captivating graphics and videos. The company’s video editing tools are some of the best in the industry. Adobe recently reported Q1 fiscal 2024 results. Revenue reached a record $5.18 billion. That’s 11% higher than the same period last year. Diluted EPS came to $1.36 on a GAAP basis. Adobe closed the quarter with $17.58 billion in remaining performance obligations, a healthy backlog. The company tapped into its financial strength to repurchase 3.1 million shares in the quarter.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips You’re at the right place if you’re seeking stocks for indirect crypto exposure. While Bitcoin (BTC-USD) ETFs are witnessing unprecedented inflows and nudging towards all-time highs, not all investors are convinced of crypto viability as a long-term investment. For instance, Vanguard Group executives view Bitcoin as too speculative for inclusion in buy-and-hold portfolios (hence their lack of interest in launching a Bitcoin ETF). But, even for crypto skeptics, opportunities for indirect crypto exposure and traditional stock stability abound. Investing in companies with significant involvement in blockchain-related activities provides indirect exposure to crypto while allowing for diversification across various applications beyond blockchain, such as identity verification and contract settlements. The rising interest in artificial intelligence has overshadowed blockchain technologies, yet companies in this space present numerous investment opportunities with substantial long-term growth potential. These investments allow those hesitant about direct cryptocurrency investments to benefit from Bitcoin’s performance. They may also provide superior returns compared to direct cryptocurrency holdings over an extended period. Crypto’s popularity is surging in Latin America, with countries like El Salvador integrating Bitcoin into their legal tender system. MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI), an Argentinian e-commerce giant, is contributing to this trend by introducing its own cryptocurrency, akin to PayPal’s (NASDAQ:PYPL) strategy, to offer shareholders indirect crypto exposure. In addition to its proprietary Mercado coin, MercadoLibre is capitalizing on the broader blockchain movement by providing a digital wallet that enables crypto trading across multiple assets, including Bitcoin.  MercadoLibre’s value extends beyond its indirect crypto exposure to diversify shareholder interests, as it remains a significant force in Latin America’s wider eCommerce sector. The company has reported consistent revenue and net income growth over the last five quarters, with sales nearing $15 billion by the end of 2023. Moreover, MercadoLibre’s management excels at managing debt, a notable achievement among tech and rapidly expanding eCommerce companies. This financial prudence is crucial for navigating the economic instability in Latin American markets, safeguarding the company and its investors. Among its multiple revenue streams, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) assists business owners with incorporating blockchain technology into their daily operations. The tech stock distinguishes itself by focusing on blockchain integration’s essential infrastructure and security aspects, providing the backbone to adopt, integrate, and manage the tech across various applications. Broadcom is diversifying its revenue streams by moving towards blockchain services and addressing previous concerns about revenue concentration, especially following its VMware merger. Previously, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) contributed to more than 20% of Broadcom’s revenue through its 5G and wireless component segments. However, with the synergies from VMware’s cloud computing and a focus on blockchain technology, Broadcom is lessening its dependence on revenue from a single source. Investors should note that integrating VMware will incur about $1 billion in transaction costs in the short term. Nevertheless, like adopting blockchain technology, this temporary volatility is a worthwhile investment for indirect crypto exposure. SBI Holdings Inc (OTCMKTS:SBHGF), a vast Japanese conglomerate, operates across various sectors, including financial services, asset management, healthcare data, and biotechnology. However, the company’s indirect crypto exposure potential primarily stems from its “crypto-asset business.” This venture integrates a variety of crypto-related and blockchain initiatives to enhance the SBI Group’s financial ecosystem in preparation for an increasingly digital finance landscape. The company has committed up to $100 million in investments to global crypto startups, offering essential funding to smaller firms challenged by the high interest rates that render debt financing exceedingly costly. Moreover, investors can take comfort in SBI’s diverse range of services, contributing to its steady profitability, a claim supported by its decently high dividend yield.  Shares dipped late last year amid accusations of stock manipulation that, thus far, haven’t been borne out by investigators. Shares are slowly returning to past highs, but it isn’t too late to get indirect crypto exposure from this unique stock.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Sometimes, you have to expand your geographic horizons to find the best deals in the financial markets. A case in point is Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) shares, which are trading at a discount right now. Don’t expect Baidu stock to be underpriced for much longer, though, as the company could soon strike a deal with a famous smartphone manufacturer. Based in China, Baidu is a search-engine market dominator that also specializes in artificial intelligence technology. You might not know this, but Baidu also launched the first 24/7 robo-taxi service in China. It’s a fascinating company that’s not a darling on Wall Street – but that’s exactly why value seekers should be in a mood to buy BIDU stock now. How cheap is Baidu stock now? It’s been as high as $150 multiple times during the past several years, but recently only traded at around $105. During a time when the U.S. market is hyper-focused on the “Magnificent Seven,” Baidu is an undervalued business. Baidu’s GAAP trailing 12-month price-to-earnings ratio is 13.51x, versus the sector median P/E ratio of 19.52x.  Baidu, like the “Mag-7” companies, is heavily involved in AI technology. Baidu isn’t in financial trouble. You might think the company is in bad shape, based on the share-price action. However, Baidu’s fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 revenue actually grew 6% year over year to 34,951 RMB. In addition, Baidu’s full-year 2023 revenue increased 9% YOY to 134.6 billion RMB. Remember, investors shouldn’t try to compare Baidu’s revenue growth to that of U.S.-based Magnificent Seven companies. China’s economy, without a doubt, has faced significant challenges and this makes Baidu’s sales growth all the more impressive. Another pillar of the bull case for Baidu stock is the company’s potential agreement with well-known smartphone manufacturer Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). If you’re still on the fence, this news item ought to convince you to invest in Baidu while the company is still undervalued. Here’s the scoop. According to The Wall Street Journal, Apple “held preliminary talks with” Baidu about the possibility of using Baidu’s generative-AI technology in Apple’s devices in China.  This team up, if it happens, would benefit both companies. Apple’s AI-enhanced devices would be more likely to satisfy China-based regulators’ inspections and requirements. As for Baidu, the company would have a powerful, capital-rich and globally recognized partner. Could this be the best tech-sector deal of 2024? No, I’m not talking about the potential deal between Baidu and Apple, though that would certainly be monumental if it happens. Rather, I’m referring to the unbeatable deal you can get right now with Baidu stock. The shares are reasonably valued, and Baidu recently demonstrated solid revenue growth. Hence, I encourage you to think globally and, before the opportunity passes you by, put some Baidu shares in your portfolio.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips The semiconductor stocks could stay hot in the second quarter as investor hype and enthusiasm over generative artificial intelligence (AI) looks to continue. Undoubtedly, some of the more value-conscious investors out there may wonder how hard the next tech correction could hit once the AI frenzy has a chance to cool off. Given the pace of industry developments, the AI and semiconductor rallies may have the fuel they need to keep running for many quarters. As much hype has surrounded the AI-facing semiconductor stocks, I’m still not sure “euphoria” is the right word to describe the latest round of industry action. Of course, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) may be one of the exceptions, given it’s managed to swing home run after home run. In any case, I believe there is value in the semiconductor scene for those willing to broaden their horizons a bit. These underpriced semiconductor stocks are worth considering. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) may have developed a reputation as a lagging chip company that’s struggled to keep up. Still, the company (and its stock, which is up 75% since its early 2023 lows) is in the process of coming back. As the firm’s big bets look to rake in a potentially sizeable return, Intel may just be in line to defy expectations as it continues investing aggressively to turn a corner.  Undoubtedly, it’s easy to dismiss CEO Pat Gelsinger’s ambitious commentary and his firm’s long-term plans. However, as the firm makes all the right bets in the right places (AI, foundry expansion and driving efficiencies), it’s becoming harder to label Intel as one of those legacy companies no longer able to grow quickly. Intel isn’t on its way out. It’s ready and willing to spend to get back on the growth track. As the firm looks to seize the AI opportunity with its own accelerators, perhaps more of the enthusiasm surrounding today’s hotter AI chip stocks will work its way over to INTC stock. It’s still an uphill battle on the road to recovery, but the firm’s chances seem to be improving with every ambitious new investment. That alone may make the firm worth backing as it keeps loosening the purse strings while staying on its toes. Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) stock may very well be getting cheaper as it rises, as the firm makes the most of the AI-induced surge in memory demand. Micron may have plenty of overseas rivals, but as far as large U.S. memory chip makers go, Micron is a standout player at this point in the AI race. Not only do you need high-powered AI accelerators to run the latest and greatest large language models (LLMs) but you’ll also need plenty of memory, specifically high-performance memory.  When it comes to top-of-the-line memory chips, Micron’s a titan in its own right, as it looks to play its vital role in helping companies get up to speed with modern AI-enabled hardware. The company’s HBM3E memory, in particular, has been an incredibly hot seller that the firm can’t seem to produce enough of. As demand outweighs supply for memory (and all other parts that go into powering AIs), it’s tough to bet against MU stock, even after a parabolic melt-up. At around 23 times forward price-to-earnings, Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) stock seems quite undervalued given its chip-making dominance. The firm builds chips for AI juggernauts Nvidia and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), so any gains in these respective AI giants are sure to drive shares of TSM. At this juncture, investors may be overemphasizing geopolitical risks associated with Taiwan Semiconductor. Of course, not everybody will be comfortable as China-Taiwan relations erode further. Regardless, I don’t think geopolitics should be the sole reason to avoid TSM stock like the plague — not while it’s continuing to gain on the backs of some heavyweights in the chip world. As the AI boom paves the way for high double-digit sales growth this year (and perhaps the year after), TSM stands out as one of the most undervalued AI chip plays in the entire semi industry.  Who knows? Perhaps any subtle improvement in China-Taiwan relations could act as another driver of shares. On the date of publication, Joey Frenette held shares of Apple.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips It’s true that even the most successful large banks and billionaire investors make mistakes. Many of them, for example, have piled large amounts of their money into Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), whose shares dropped 12% so far in 2024. So you might not get rich by copying a few picks made by huge banks and billionaires. But, as I’ve pointed out in the past, these investors do have good track records in general. They have access to top-notch research, and they often receive a great deal of information from company insiders. Therefore, you can certainly do worse than emulating the moves made by these investing gurus. With that said, here are three stocks top investors are buying. In the fourth quarter of last year, Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, Norges Bank, acquired 18.1 million shares of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), while JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) added over 7 million shares. Also importantly, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) bought 3.23 million shares of the firm while Fisher Asset Management, owned by multi-billionaire investor Ken Fisher, acquired over 428,000 shares of the name. So AMZN is certainly one of the stocks top investors are buying. Then, in January Canadian bank RBC Capital identified AMZN as a leading pick in the internet space. The bank cited its belief that the firm’s cloud business’ growth will increase this year. Additionally, RBC expects the growth of AMZN’s e-commerce business to enable its EBIT to beat analysts’ average estimate. Finally, RBC is bullish on the firm’s new ad business and its opportunities in the AI space. JPMorgan bought nearly 7.5 million shares of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock in Q4, while Norges Bank added 9.2 million shares of the name. And, multi-billionaire David Tepper added about 2,720 shares, increasing his total ownership of the firm to 1.7 million shares. Moreover, Goldman Sachs bought nearly 3.26 million shares and RBC Capital acquired almost 1.24 million units.  On March 26, investment bank Wedbush Capital reported that, based on its research, it believed that the growth of MSFT’s revenue from its AI tools was increasing. The bank now expects that 70% of MSFT’s users will eventually utilize its AI tools, up from its previous outlook of 60%. The bank expects the company’s revenue from the technology to reach a positive turning point next year. Multibillionaire hedge fund owner David Tepper bought General Motors (NYSE:GM) stock for the first time in Q4, purchasing 265,000 shares of the American automaker.  Moreover, Norges Bank acquired 2.1 million shares, and Goldman Sachs picked up a huge 5.2 million units. Two Sigma Advisers acquired 1.385 million units of GM in Q4. Finally, Citadel Advisors, owned by multi-billionaire Ken Griffin, bought 2.6 million shares of the name in Q4. In December, Japanese bank Mizuho raised its rating on GM stock to “buy” from “neutral.” As reasons for the change, the bank cited reductions in GM’s fixed costs, changes that will boost the profitability of its EV lineup, and a suspension of its investments in its Cruise autonomous unit. Additionally, Mizuho was pleased with the $10 billion of share buybacks which the firm expects to carry out this year. On the date of publication, Larry Ramer held a long position in AMZN.

      "The “Magnificent Seven” is a term coined to describe big tech giants such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), Meta (NASDAQ:META), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). Each of these stocks gained at least 49% in 2023 and have strong competitive advantages. Here, I have shortlisted one Magnificent Seven stock, Alphabet, to see if it is a good buy right now. Overall, I am bullish on Alphabet due to its attractive valuation, the AI megatrend, and its expanding profit margins. Alphabet is the parent company of Google, the largest search engine platform globally. Valued at $1.93 trillion, Alphabet generates a majority of its sales from online ads on its search engine and YouTube, which Google acquired more than a decade ago. Moreover, Alphabet sells applications, digital content, and in-app purchases via the Google Play store. In recent years, Alphabet has entered high-growth segments such as public cloud and artificial intelligence, diversifying its revenue streams in the process. Shares of Alphabet went public in August 2004 and have since returned a monstrous 5,637%. It means a $1,000 investment in GOOGL stock soon after its IPO would be worth close to $60,000 today. In this period, the S&P 500 Index (SPX) returned “just” 600%.  Despite an uncertain macro environment in 2023, Alphabet increased its sales by 9% year-over-year to $307 billion. Its top-line growth accelerated to 13% in the December quarter, surpassing $86 billion. A focus on cost optimization meant the company’s cost of sales rose by only 5% to $23.6 billion, while operating expenses stood at $25 billion, up 11%, allowing the tech giant to report an operating income of $23.7 billion, up 30% compared to the year-ago period, indicating a healthy margin of 27%. A high operating margin translates into free cash flow, which can be deployed to reinvest in organic growth, enhance shareholder wealth, and target accretive acquisitions. In Q4, Alphabet reported free cash flow of $7.9 billion, while the number was much higher at $69 billion in 2023. Similar to other tech heavyweights, Alphabet allocated $62 billion to share buybacks for its Class A and Class C shares last year and ended 2023 with $111 billion in total cash. Alphabet is among the leading players in the artificial intelligence space. In fact, the company is deploying AI capabilities to improve its portfolio of products from Search to ads. In the last year, Alphabet launched AI-powered products such as Bard and Gemini, which should fuel the next generation of advances.  While Gemini has encountered some issues, the platform is engineered to understand and combine text, images, audio, video, and code while running on devices ranging from smartphones to data centers. Alphabet emphasized that it is experimenting with Gemini in Search, making SGE (Search Generative Experience) faster for users. By integrating AI with Search, Alphabet serves a wide range of information requirements. Bard is Alphabet’s conversational AI tool that is powered by Gemini Pro. Available in 40 languages and 230 countries, Bard will remain a key platform for Alphabet, going forward. Alphabet ended 2023 with more than $15 billion in annual subscription revenue, primarily driven by YouTube. Today, YouTube Music and YouTube Premium are available in more than 100 countries, and these platforms enjoy a highly engaged user base. Generally, recurring sales allow a company to generate steady cash flows across market cycles. Alphabet’s increase in subscription sales over the years showcases its ability to deliver high-value offerings to a wide range of users.  Another subscription service offered by Alphabet is Google One, where you pay to store your photos, videos, files, and other data. Google One is experiencing strong user growth and has attracted almost 100 million subscribers to date. Turning to Google Cloud, the business increased sales by 26% year-over-year in Q4 to $9.2 billion. The segment is now reporting consistent profits, ending Q4 with an operating income of $864 million, indicating a margin of 9%. For FY 2023, Google Cloud sales rose 26% to $33 billion, accounting for more than 10% of total revenue. Google Cloud aims to integrate Gemini to widen its base of enterprise customers which should also drive engagement rates higher. Alphabet claimed strong demand for its vertically integrated AI portfolio will create new opportunities for Google Cloud across its product portfolio. Out of the 37 analyst ratings given to GOOGL stock, 29 are Buys, eight are Holds, and none are Sells, indicating a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average GOOGL stock price target is $165.28, indicating upside potential of 6.7% from current levels. Analysts tracking GOOGL stock expect adjusted earnings to expand from $5.80 per share in 2023 to $6.81 per share in 2024 and $7.85 per share in 2025. So, priced at 22.8x forward earnings, Google stock is not too expensive, even though it trades at a higher multiple than peers, as its bottom line is forecast to grow by more than 15% annually in the next two years.  Alphabet is a company firing on all cylinders. Despite its massive size, the tech behemoth continues to grow revenue and earnings at an enviable pace while improving profit margins. Additionally, its investments in AI should equip Alphabet with the resources to gain traction in the highly disruptive market over time. Disclosure\n",
      "When so much critical infrastructure is based in one place, the dangers of disruption to supply chains can run high. The market reaction to Taiwan’s powerful earthquake on Wednesday showed how companies in the semiconductor supply chain have been ready for this moment for years. The 7.4 magnitude earthquake struck at around 8 a.m. local time, with the epicenter nearly 100 miles away from the capital, Taipei. Around a dozen people were reported to have been killed in the quake. Most of the casualties were in Hualien, the closest city to the epicenter, with reports of many trapped and injured and widespread damage. Hualien City, Taiwan earthquake9 killed and 934 injured after 7.4-magnitude earthquakekilling nine people and injuring at least 934, according to Taiwan's fire department.India stand with Taiwan🇹🇼🇮🇳#Taiwan #Tsunami pic.twitter.com/gnZZmp4HGU The market reaction was muted, with the main Taiwan Weighted index finishing just 0.6% lower.  The impact could have been much worse, however, if critical semiconductor manufacturing infrastructure had been damaged. The country’s leading producer of chips is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM). Its shares were up 1.6% after the company said its safety operations had functioned normally. It issued a statement: “TSMC’s safety systems are operating normally. To ensure the safety of personnel, some fabs were evacuated according to company procedure. We are currently confirming the details of the impact.” Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU), which operates four production facilities in Taiwan, was up 3.1% at $126.53. Micron said in a statement: “We are evaluating impact to our operations and supply chain. We will communicate changes to delivery commitments to our customers after this evaluation is completed.”  It’s expected, though, that both companies will restart at least some production in the coming days. Modern buildings, particularly those situated in regions that are prone to such natural disasters, are designed to withstand higher magnitudes of shock than those experienced on Wednesday. Let us offer one Hail Mary for the victims of the massive earthquake that has struck Taiwan. #OneHailMarycampaign #Taiwan #earthquake Image Courtesy: Reuters pic.twitter.com/p32yduCGtf However, some were less optimistic. “Tech enthusiast” Fabrizio said on X: “Some of TSMC’s high-end chips, such as the 3nm A17 Pro in the iPhone 15 Pro and ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ Max, require round-the-clock operations and a stable vacuum environment for several weeks. As a result, some high-end chips already in production are likely to have been spoiled. Spencer Hakimian, founder of Toulou Capital Management, said on X: “The world is 4.5x more dependent on Taiwan for advanced semiconductors than Europe was on Russia energy imports before the war in Ukraine. “Any disruption to TSMC's production due to the earthquake in Taiwan will have immediate effects on prices, GDP, supply chains, etc. on the rest of the world.”  Investors in the U.S. appeared unperturbed by the possible supply chain disruptions. The VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NYSE:SMH), which includes holdings in TSMC, rose 0.7%. And what about TSMC’s customers? Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), which TSMC in its earnings filings calls “Customer number one,” gained 1% to $170.28, while “Customer number two,” which most people take to be Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was down 0.2%.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Stocks may already be off to a rough start this month, but it’s not too late to consider getting out of the tech stocks to sell in April. The reasons for this are twofold. First, the market could continue to change direction. Now that there’s greater uncertainty about when the Federal Reserve will begin lowering interest rates, volatility may continue for the stocks most sensitive to interest rates, which includes high-growth tech stocks. Second, beyond macro factors, with many top names in tech, there are company-specific concerns that should warrant a fast exit. Some of these problem-plagued tech names have already started to decline due to such issues. However, even in these situations, it is far too early to say that the dust has settled. With this in mind, let’s take a look at the following seven tech stocks to sell in April. Interestingly enough, two of them are “Magnificent Seven” components.  Most of the “Mag 7” stocks have been in the green thus far in 2024, but not Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Shares in the iPhone maker have experienced a moderate move lower since the start of the year. Weak demand for the company’s iconic product, especially in China, has weighed heavily on shares. In addition, there’s an antitrust suit filed against Apple by the U.S. Department of Justice, and 15 U.S. state attorney generals. Following the recent AAPL stock slump, some may be saying that this tech giant has become a buy on the dip. Largely, due to the possible emergence of a generative AI catalyst for shares. Still, the above-mentioned headwinds will continue to persist in the near-term. Apple is expected to next report earnings sometime in early May. With some analysts anticipating disappointment with Apple’s upcoming fiscal results, AAPL may be on the verge of another pullback. Thanks to “AI mania,” IBM (NYSE:IBM) shares have finally broken from a more than decade-long slump. Yet while those early to the gen AI trade in “Big Blue” have profited, not only is it too late to pounce on this opportunity. The AI catalyst may now be excessively priced into IBM stock. As I argued last month, investors are perhaps overestimating how much gen AI-related growth will boost the tech giant’s overall operating performance. Sure, this may be merely a case of splitting hairs, if “AI mania” is set to continue.  But if “AI mania” is fading, and a changing market drives a sell-off for AI stocks, IBM could reverse course. Irrespective of an “AI bust,” if IBM’s growth fails to re-accelerate in the coming quarters, a sell-off could still occur. With major downside risk in mind, consider IBM one of the tech stocks to sell in April. Just like IBM, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is another “old school” tech name that has experienced a big rally thanks to all the excitement surrounding the rise of gen AI. Over the past six months, the chip maker’s shares have rallied by nearly 24%. That said, some negative factors have started to weigh on INTC stock. This includes a recent China chip crackdown, but a larger concern has to do with Intel’s foundry business. Intel’s plans to become a major foundry, or third-party manufacturer of semiconductors for “fabless” chip designers, have been a key component of its overall turnaround plans. However, with this unit reporting big losses, and not expected to hit breakeven until 2027, the Intel turnaround appears to be taking longer-than-expected. With shares trading as if a turnaround has already happened, at 32.1 times forward earnings, INTC may be in for a de-rating, as investors reset expectations. Slowing growth and a rich valuation is what makes Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) one of the tech stocks to sell in April. Since the pandemic, this e-commerce software company has scaled up significantly. Reporting around $1.6 billion in revenue during 2019, last year Shopify’s top line came in at over $7 billion.  However, after this significant scale-up, which has also resulted in a move to consistent profitability, things are slowing down for Shopify. Revenue increased by around 26% last year, but top-line growth is expected to decelerate to around 20% this year and next year. Earnings growth is also decelerating. This calls into question the super-high valuation of SHOP stock. Shares today trade for a staggering 76.2 times forward earnings. Potentially at risk of being “priced for perfection,” following Shopify’s upcoming earnings release on May 2, the stock could experience a heavy post-earnings sell-off. Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW) is another situation where the market put the cart before the horse, with regard to potential AI-related tailwinds for this cloud data company. As you may recall, SNOW experienced a big run-up in price between November and February. However, the direction of SNOW stock changed dramatically starting on Feb 28. As I recently discussed, that’s when investors bailed on Snowflake, following the company’s latest quarterly earnings release, which coincided with the surprising news of Snowflake CEO Frank Slootman’s resignation. Yet even after SNOW’s more than 32% drop since this spate of disheartening news, more downside may lie ahead. Shares trade for 163.6 times forward earnings. AI optimism may enable shares to sustain this valuation today, but as Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co. analyst Brian White recently argued, skepticism about the AI catalyst could increase. In turn, this could lead to significant multiple compression for shares.  Atlassian (NASDAQ:TEAM) is a purveyor of project management software. Its products include Jira, Confluence, and Trello. Again, like many other enterprise software stocks, TEAM late last year and early this year received a major boost thanks to the AI trend. Just like similar plays, this boost has long since peaked. TEAM stock has slid 17.6% lower since the start of the year. Admittedly, it may be an overstatement to say that this represents a major sell-off. However, another round of big price declines may be just around the corner. Why? Post-market on April 25, Atlassian will release its latest quarterly results and guidance. Even if the company delivers an earnings beat, updates to guidance could fall short, much like what happened last quarter. To avoid getting caught holding the bag in the event of a post-earnings sell-off, consider TEAM one of the tech stocks to sell in April. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) continues to take a big tumble. The latest move lower for the EV maker’s has been driven by disappointing quarterly deliveries data. Reported deliveries of 386,810 vehicles came in below already walked-back expectations. Softening demand and falling margins have been at the root of the TSLA stock sell-off. These major negatives are likely to continue in the near-term. Clearly not immune to the cyclicality of the auto business, there’s now even more reason to question why TSLA’s  massive valuation premium to other automotive stocks.  Previously, I’ve argued that an opportunity may emerge to snap up this Mag 7 component at a “can’t miss” price. However, at around $165 per share, TSLA has a ways to go before reaching the buy zone, which is around $100 per share. In the meantime, exit any existing Tesla stock positions, and wait for this ideal entry point.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips In a politically divisive ecosystem, about the only thing we can achieve bipartisanship on are Nancy Pelosi stocks. Yes, the former House Speaker herself represents a lightning rod for controversy. Yet she seems to know her way around the market. That’s not surprising. Love her or not love her (let’s not get too negative here), we must respect her shrewd gamesmanship and intellect. Of course, depending on where you land in the political spectrum, you’re going to disagree with that last point. That’s okay. The point is you can’t be a complete fool to be elected to Congress. Well, maybe I shouldn’t have said that. Let’s move on – below are still-relevant Nancy Pelocy stocks still worth buying in the second quarter. Falling under the broader technology ecosystem, Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) plies its trade in the software infrastructure space. Specifically, it’s one of the top names in the cybersecurity realm, an increasingly important arena. While we talk a great game about rising innovations such as artificial intelligence, they also potentially leave us vulnerable to nefarious activities.  Fundamentally, it’s one of the Nancy Pelosi stocks to buy for the obvious reason that cybercriminals will continue committing crimes. What’s worse, AI could lower the threshold for budding hackers, making enterprise security all the more relevant. Therefore, it’s not at all surprising that in the last fiscal year, the company beat all four quarterly bottom-line targets. For the current fiscal year, analysts anticipate earnings per share of $5.50. That’s a significant increase over last year’s print of $4.44. On the top line, they believe revenue could reach $7.98 billion. Again, that’s a noticeable bump (15.8%) over fiscal 2023’s $6.89 billion tally. It’s easily one of the Nancy Pelosi stocks to buy in Q2. Consumer technology giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) needs no introduction, if only for the reason that there’s a very good chance you own one of its products. If viewership metrics are anything to go by, there’s also a solid chance you’re reading this on an Apple device. Naturally, AAPL stock makes for a solid investment despite pressures against the economy. Yes, discretionary spending faces significant headwinds. That’s not a shocking statement after years of high inflation and high borrowing costs. Nevertheless, Apple has a social cachet that can’t be ignored. People need its products even though technically, they don’t need it. Such a backdrop has led to consistent profitability. Last fiscal year, Apple beat all its quarterly bottom-line targets. For the current fiscal year, analysts are looking for EPS of $6.56. That’s a decent bump from last year’s metric of $6.13. On the revenue front, we’re not looking at great numbers: an average estimate of $387.95 billion against last year’s print of $383.29 billion. Still, for overall stability, AAPL could make a solid case for Nancy Pelosi stocks to buy.  Another big play among Nancy Pelosi stocks that requires no introduction, I’m definitely using Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) products to write this story. So, you know who to blame. In all seriousness, Microsoft’s Software as a Service (SaaS) is an indispensable asset in the business or academic world. You can play around with other platforms but when things need to get done, Microsoft is the name (almost) everyone turns to. Yes, the spotlight centers on the company’s major investments in AI. So far, this directive has proved very lucrative. Nevertheless, I like Microsoft for its everyday relevancies: the aforementioned SaaS as well as its practically universal operating system and cloud-computing network. It’s difficult to imagine life without the tech juggernaut. Unsurprisingly, it has been consistently profitable. For fiscal year 2024, analysts are seeking EPS of $11.65, well above last year’s print of $9.81. Notably, even the least-optimistic projection stands at $11.40. For revenue, we’re talking about $244.22 billion, up a massive 15.2% from last year’s haul of $211.91 billion. I think it’s a buy, irrespective of the Nancy Pelosi connection. Even with the vaunted category of Nancy Pelosi stocks, you come across some tricky narratives. For me, that would be American Express (NYSE:AXP). Don’t get me wrong – I think it’s a fine company. You never leave home without it, am I right? Still, with so many Americans indebted (to the tune of over $1 trillion), I’m a bit concerned about credit-card companies.  Let’s get that out of the way first. Having said that, let me also say that if I had to invest in a credit card company, it would be AXP stock. Why? American Express generally caters to a wealthier clientele. And so, even with rising plastic delinquencies, AmEx customers should be the least impacted. It’s still a tricky play though. In the first and fourth quarters last year, the company missed analysts’ EPS targets. Looking to the end of fiscal 2024, experts believe that AmEx will post EPS of $12.80. That’s up noticeably from last year’s print of $11.21. For revenue, we’re looking at $66.15 billion, up 9.3% from 2023’s tally of $60.52 billion. To start, Disney (NYSE:DIS) is one of the Nancy Pelosi stocks that the namesake legislator has been selling. It’s understandable. While the entertainment giant – which features an enviable content library along with a portfolio of theme parks and resorts – commands a massive brand, it has also struggled since late 2021. Still, a clear recovery is in play. Since the beginning of the year, DIS stock gained over 35% of equity value. Over the past 52 weeks, it’s up more than 23%. Sure, at this point, it does trade at 75.81X trailing-year earnings. As well, it runs a sales premium of 2.52X last year’s revenue. Nevertheless, it’s also possible that the entertainment leader is attempting to return to its throne. I think it’s worth considering. In Q1 2023, Disney met the analysts’ EPS target of 93 cents. From Q2 to Q4, the positive earnings surprise came out to 8.4%, then 17.1%, finally culminating at 23.2%. That’s earnings growth if I’ve ever seen it.  For fiscal 2024, analysts are looking for EPS of $4.68 against last year’s result of $3.76. Given the trend, it’s a solid wager. The former House speaker has both bought and sold shares of tech juggernaut Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Most recently, she has trimmed her exposure to GOOGL stock. Still, even without her direct show of support, I think it’s one of the Nancy Pelosi stocks to consider. Yes, GOOGL has enjoyed a solid run, moving up 48% in the past 52 weeks. There could still be more gains to be had. One of the criticisms against Alphabet is that it’s not particularly winning the generative AI game. Microsoft’s investment in OpenAI and its chatbot ChatGPT has taken the world by storm. Alphabet’s Gemini (previously called Bard) is okay but doesn’t have first-mover advantage. Still, as I argued previously, Alphabet could eventually tweak its platform to become a true AI winner. It practically owns the internet so an exploitable synergy exists. For fiscal 2024, covering experts believe EPS will reach $6.81. That’s a big jump from last year’s print of $5.80. Also, they’re looking for revenue to land at $342.34 billion. Again, we’re talking a large gap from last year’s result of $307.39 billion. Finally, we come to the riskiest idea among Nancy Pelosi stocks, financial technology (fintech) stalwart PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL). It’s so risky that she decided to sell it. I can understand the decision and I’d say it’s worked out for her. While PYPL is up more than 5% since the beginning of the year, it’s down 14% in the trailing year. Obviously, that’s not encouraging amid wider tech bullishness.  Still, I’m not ready to abandon ship on PYPL just yet. For example, with the Covid-19 crisis imparting massive changes in the workforce, the gig economy could rise higher than expected. That would certainly be the case as more companies demand a return to the office. It’s also interesting to note that PayPal has performed quite well last year against bottom-line targets. For fiscal year 2024, analysts are looking for EPS of $5.07. That’s a bit disappointing compared to last year’s result of $5.10. However, revenue might land at $31.86 billion. If so, that would be a 7% bump from last year’s tally of $29.77 billion. It’s worth looking into if you’re a contrarian.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Warren Buffett once remarked, “Price is what you pay. Value is what you get.” It’s a caution to investors to not just look at the cost of what a stock is charging you to buy it but to understand what you will receive for your money. Penny stock investors quickly learn that lesson. They may be able to scoop up a lot of shares of thinly traded companies only to lose their entire investment in a pump-and-dump scheme. Meanwhile, an investment in Buffett’s own Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) 10 years ago would have set you back a cool $187,000 for a single share but today is worth almost $632,000. Which was the better price to pay? Who got more value for their money? Oscar Wilde phrased it a bit differently. “[A cynic] knows the price of everything and the value of nothing.” The sentiment remains the same. So, if you come across a high-priced investment, don’t dismiss it out of hand as not worth the cost. It may be a great deal regardless. Below are three stocks priced above $1,000 and worth every penny.  Semiconductor stock Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is steadily transforming itself from a chipmaker for mobile devices into an infrastructure solutions company. The closing of its acquisition of VMWare last year should be what finally allows it to happen. Broadcom expects about half of its revenue to come from infrastructure software this year. The chipmaker has been a serial acquirer ever since Avago bought Broadcom in 2016 for $37 billion. It kept the Broadcom name and the Avago ticker symbol. In the seven years since that deal, the company sought to transition away from the cyclical chip business into the more steadfast software market. It gobbled up CA Technologies, Symantec and Brocade. Now VMWare pushes it towards completion. Yet, Broadcom still heavily relies upon its mobile chip customers, most notably Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). The tech giant represented 20% of Broadcom’s revenue for the past two years, though it is likely to be a smaller percentage going forward. One share of AVGO stock will set you back around $1,300. But shifting away from the mercurial semiconductor business will offer Broadcom greater clarity into where its revenue comes from and where the business is heading. Grab this one before it’s gone! Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) is currently priced at more than $2,800 a share, but a 50-to-1 stock split in June should bring the restaurant chain’s stock down into the $50 to $60 per share range. As nothing else changes about the business, the Mexican food company is still a growth stock to buy.  The force that drove CMG stock 63% higher last year and 225% over the past five years was the addition of drive-thru lanes at its restaurants. A surprisingly simple solution that really became imperative during the pandemic, adding Chipotlanes to its stores increased mobile digital orders. Customers could slip in and out quickly, improving Chipotle’s restaurant productivity, profit margins and returns. In the fourth quarter, Chipotle opened 121 new locations, 110 of which had a drive-thru window. It is also retrofitting existing locations. Of the 3,400 restaurants in operation, the company expects as many as 1,000 to have a drive-thru installed. Wall Street expects CMG earnings to grow at a 33% compound annual rate over the next five years. That makes its forward price-to-earnings ratio of 44 not wholly unwarranted. It’s likely earnings will expand at an even faster rate as more Chipotlanes are installed. Industrial toolmaker W.W. Grainger (NYSE:GWW) is a new member of the $1,000 per share club, but this is a long, steady grower that puts the S&P 500 to shame. Over the past decade, GWW stock has given a total return of nearly 300% compared to the broad market index’s total return of around 180%. Investors have long appreciated Grainger’s extended dividend history and increases for over 50 years, making it a Dividend King. In the last 10 years, the industrial supplier’s dividend increased at about 7% CAGR while it grew free cash flow (FCF) more than 8% annually. With an FCF payout ratio of less than 25%, there is plenty of room for another 50 years of increases.  The company operates in two segments: high-touch solutions (HTS) and endless assortment. Silly names, but descriptive of what its maintenance, repair and operations (MRO) customers need. The former is for customers with complex buying needs who shop at its Grainger stores, while the latter is its e-commerce platform where customers can find millions of products. W.W. Grainger derives over 80% of its $16.5 billion in annual revenue from the HTS segment, and with growing demand, GWW stock is worth the price tag it carries.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Identifying opportunities and risks within the ever-evolving stock market landscape is crucial for investors aiming to make informed decisions. This research examines three well-known tech stocks and finds strong arguments for selling them before the next market correction. Let’s start with the first one. It’s a massive social media platform with great user engagement stats, but its growth trajectory is unpredictable due to its dependency on outside variables like world events and algorithm tweaks. While leading the way in machine vision technology, the second company needs help making money because it depends too much on declining end sectors, especially semiconductors and consumer electronics. Due to its inadequate diversification strategy, the corporation is more susceptible to industry changes. Lastly, the third company is well-known for its innovation and market leadership. However, it sees a drop in revenue from its core goods as the competition for tablets grows. Swings further hamper sustained growth in the wearables and accessories market.  When one delves into the complexities of these tech behemoths, one finds underlying weaknesses that call for prudence. Reddit (NYSE:RDDT) depends on user engagement metrics for measuring growth and use, such as Weekly Active Unique (WAUq) and Daily Active Unique (DAUq). For instance, in Q4 2023, the global DAUq increased by 27% year-over-year (YoY). Here, the U.S. fraction is expanding by 34% YoY, and the rest of the world is growing by 21% YoY. Similarly, in Q4, the U.S. experienced a 14% sequential rise, while the rest of the globe saw an 8% gain. Global DAUq growth was 11% compared to Q3. An inflection point may be identified by comparing the YoY and consecutive increases in the user metrics. Fundamentally, Reddit’s user engagement ratings are unstable because of external influences, including global events, societal shifts and adjustments to search engine algorithms. For example, the platform’s growth is highly dependent on outside factors, which makes steady growth uncertain. While certain occurrences, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, led to a rise in user growth, when the pandemic’s impacts decreased, there were subsequent drops. Crucially, logged-out users make up a sizable amount of Reddit’s incremental user growth; these individuals do not earn at the same pace as logged-in users. As of 2023, 75% of the new users recruited since July 2023 were logged out. Hence, this has presented difficulties for revenue generation and monetization.  When comparing quarterly and yearly results, Cognex‘s (NASDAQ:CGNX) revenue decreased in almost every end market. The markets with the largest decreases were semiconductors, consumer electronics and logistics. For example, revenue in Q4 2023 fell by 18% from Q4 2022. Meanwhile, sales from China fell even more throughout the quarter, indicating a challenging economic climate. Moreover, Cognex’s revenue problems were exacerbated by its overreliance on end sectors experiencing severe downturns, such as semiconductors and consumer electronics. The reduction in income from these areas shows the company’s poor diversification strategy and susceptibility to swings in particular industries. Even if the performance of some end markets, such as packaging and the automotive industry, was comparatively steady, it could not offset the losses in other industries. In 2023, revenue fell in every area, with China seeing the biggest drop. China’s revenue fell even more in Q4 2023, indicative of the challenging economic climate there. Hence, Cognex’s performance in global markets, especially in China, indicates difficulties adjusting to shifting market dynamics and economic uncertainty. Overall, the company is susceptible to geopolitical and economic issues in strategic geographic regions, as highlighted by the drop in revenue from China. With $7 billion in revenue for Q1 2024, Apple‘s (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPad revenue saw a notable 25% YoY fall. One fewer sales week and a difficult comparison with introducing new iPad models in Q1 caused this dip. Additionally, despite the iPad’s performance and adaptability, competitors’ more reasonably priced tablet options pose a greater threat to the company’s share of the tablet industry. The drop in iPad sales highlights Apple’s inability to maintain tablet category growth. Even if iPads are still well-liked by some groups of people, such as professionals and students, the income is dropping. This suggests that retaining market share and customer interest may take time and effort. Furthermore, Apple may need help generating demand for its iPad goods as the market becomes more competitive and tablet replacement cycles extend. Hence, this would limit the company’s ability to develop quickly in this market.  Finally, the Wearables, Home, and Accessories segment’s erratic revenue reveals a flaw in Apple’s capacity to sustain steady growth in this product area. For the company, wearables and accessories are a significant top-line source. Therefore, their susceptibility to seasonal fluctuations and launch cycles makes quick expansion difficult.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips The Nasdaq is absolutely on fire. The broad macroeconomic picture has been about as good as it could get for growth stocks. The economy is not too hot and it’s not too cold. Inflation is coming down, and the Federal Reserve may be set for interest rate cuts later this year, even as asset prices remain strong. As a result, traders are piling into Nasdaq stocks. We’ve seen momentum trades break out to the upside in categories such a semiconductors and artificial intelligence. This all makes sense from a macroeconomic perspective. But not all of these surging Nasdaq stocks are going to see continued prosperity. In fact, many appear to be setting up for steep declines once the current hype cycle wears off. These are seven Nasdaq stocks to sell before they really start to tank.  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a great example of how investors have assigned high valuations to many leading Nasdaq stocks for years. Investors have viewed Apple as a safe haven. There was no need to worry about its lofty valuation because it had a dominant hold on the smartphone market. It was considered a defensive stock and folks bought AAPL shares without any concerns around interest rates or a potential recession. You could say that Apple has an effective tax on the communications market. The problem should be evident now that the government is taking aim at its purported monopoly on high-end smartphones. Apple’s defensive nature has been called into question. Only time will tell if the government succeeds in limiting Apple’s allegedly monopolistic powers or perhaps even breaking up the company entirely. Regardless, 27 times earnings seems excessive for a business that has barely grown in recent years and which has a huge amount of exposure to the struggling Chinese market. Apple stock is suddenly quite a terrifying thing to hold at this elevated starting valuation. Traders should use the antitrust lawsuit news to exit AAPL stock before its overvaluation is exposed.  At first glance Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) might not seem like the most obvious Nasdaq stock set to plummet. After all, hasn’t Tesla already dropped dramatically, at least, in comparison with the rest of the market? The thing is, however, that Tesla was starting from an exceedingly high valuation. It had a triple-digit price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio at various points in recent years. That’s a simply ludicrous level for what is, at its core, a car manufacturing company. Tesla has now pulled back to about 50 times earnings which is less egregious than before. But 50 times earnings is still a huge number for an automotive firm. Furthermore, there’s no guarantee that those earnings will grow either. If anything, with the price cuts and mountains of competition in the EV space, earnings could be set for a considerable decline in coming years. Elon Musk’s erratic behavior on social media could also dissuade potential Tesla buyers. Multiple analysts have also downgraded TSLA stock recently.  All this suggests that the Tesla stock could plunge much further in a Nasdaq bear market. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is one of the companies that has been central to the recent artificial intelligence (AI) and semiconductor themes. AMD has been a longtime rival to Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) across various markets. Traders are hoping that AMD will be able to cash in on some of the same trends that have powered Nvidia’s exponential rise over the past year. Many bears have been quick to say Nvidia is a bubble stock selling at an unfathomable valuation. However, say what you will about the sustainability of Nvidia’s business, but it is earning a ton of money right now. AMD by contrast has been far slower in launching its AI products. And as a result, its profitability is limited to say the least. While AMD now has a nearly $300 billion market capitalization it is earning less than $1 billion per year of net income. This puts it at a shocking 345 times trailing earnings. Shares also go for 13 times revenues and a jaw dropping 260 times free cash flow. These are figures that make even the dot-com stocks of the 2000 bubble look reasonable by comparison.  Perhaps the AI boom will be strong enough and persist long enough that even the second-tier slow-to-market companies like AMD will eventually cash in. If not, however, AMD stock seems set for a crash so large it will be recorded in the history books. It might be a surprise to hear that Costco (NASDAQ:COST) is a Nasdaq stock at risk of major downside. What’s Costco doing on the Nasdaq in the first place? While the Nasdaq is mostly tech-oriented growth stocks, there are some names from other sectors as well, including club retailer Costco. Indeed, COST stock is part of the flagship Nasdaq 100 Index. And like many of its peers, Costco has become wildly overvalued. Costco recently reached $750 per share. That’s a gigantic move given that the stock was under $500 not all that long ago. In total, the stock is up 54% over the past year. This has pushed COST stock up to a baffling 46 times this year’s estimated earnings. Meanwhile, analysts are projecting just 5% revenue growth for the year and the firm just missed earnings last quarter. As a brick-and-mortar retailer there’s only so much Costco can do to grow. It has already built stores in most of the best possible locations. Costco is not a particularly strong player in e-commerce, limiting growth from that channel as well.  It’s a mature company that has significant limits to growth. Investors are about to discover that paying 46 times earnings for a slow-growing retailer usually doesn’t end well. A tech company may be able to grow its way out of this sort of inflated P/E multiple. A big box store almost certainly will not. Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST) is another one of the more surprising companies in the Nasdaq 100 Index. Despite not being a tech company, however, Monster has certainly proven to be a quality growth stock over the years. Shares are up more than 400% over the past decade. However, Monster may now be living off its past accomplishments. The energy drink market is saturated. The U.S. market and various international markets now have tremendous distribution of energy drinks and there are fewer new consumers left to reach. Monster also benefited from strong consumer spending as the economy came roaring hot out of the lockdowns. But that tailwind will let up at some point, particularly as consumers struggle with the impacts of higher inflation and food prices. Monster also faces more competition. In particular, Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) has created a highly competitive product that has shown absolutely sizzling growth in recent years. In many ways, Celsius today could be what Monster was 10 or 15 years ago.  Monster is now a mature company with a much slower growth rate. As such, MNST stock’s 35 P/E multiple is far too high as it runs out of juice. Compared to many of the companies on this list, Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) might seem like a relative value at around 25 times earnings. The travel and hospitality company has built a strong platform around sharing homes and apartment rooms. The company also did a tremendous job of maintaining its business’ core advantages during the Covid disruption and it has fully cashed in on the travel recovery trend of the past few years. But the growth is coming to an end. Airbnb is no longer a plucky newcomer. Nowadays, most savvy travelers are quite familiar with Airbnb and either regularly use the platform or have rejected it for one reason or another. Growth will be much harder to come by as Airbnb can’t grow simply from word-of-mouth advertising anymore. There’s also increasing pushback as Airbnb’s prices have escalated. Oftentimes Airbnb is more expensive than just using a hotel nowadays. Consumers are complaining about excessive fees, cleaning costs, and so on.  Finally, there’s a great deal of regulatory pushback. Cities like New York and Barcelona have put severe limitations in place on Airbnb’s business model. It’s not just a couple of huge cities, either. Increasingly even cities in emerging markets such as Medellin, Colombia are greatly limiting the short-term rental market. Combine a slowing travel sector, increasingly expensive product, and mounting regulatory pushback – that’s a recipe for significant declining Airbnb share price. Do you remember the weight loss drug phenomenon from last fall? How GLP-1 drugs were going to wipe out packaged foods companies, alcohol producers, and more? The knives were also out for the healthcare companies that treated people with obesity and diabetes. Fast forward six months, and it’s as if that risk never happened. Diabetes monitoring and management company Dexcom (NASDAQ:DXCM) is a leading example of this. Dexcom shares fell more than 30% last fall as analyst suggested that fewer people would use the company’s glucose monitoring solutions thanks to the weight loss drugs. Some people were suggesting that the whole diabetes management field might become obsolete.  The claims around the speed and efficacy of the weight loss drugs were probably hyperbolic to a degree. That said, there is something real. The GLP-1 drugs are still gaining momentum – more people are taking these drugs as doctors are becoming comfortable with prescribing them. As long as the trend toward GLP-1 drug usages continues, that should help limit the population of folks dealing with chronic diabetes. This, in turn, will have an impact on Dexcom’s available market for glucose monitoring solutions. DXCM stock has regained all of its losses since last year. That seems overdone given the longer-term questions to the business model. As if that weren’t enough, Dexcom shares are trading for more than 60 times forward earnings.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips In March, I discussed three reasons why most investors should never buy bank stocks. Banks’ balance sheets and income statements need to be simpler for most do-it-yourself investors to understand. However, if you must invest in the banking industry, narrowing your focus to dividend aristocrat bank stocks makes sense. Dividend aristocrats are S&P 500 companies that have increased their annual dividend for 25 or more consecutive years. Currently, only 68 companies make the cut. But unfortunately, no bank stocks are on the list due to the 2008 financial crisis. There are asset managers and insurance companies, but no banks. That said, some have increased their dividends over the past decade. These are the ones that investors ought to focus on. Should we not go through another financial crisis over the next 15 years, bank stocks could return to dividend aristocrat territory. These three are on their way, and have increased their annual payout over the past 10 years. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) has increased its dividend by 159% over the past decade, from $1.58 in 2014 to $4.10 in 2023, a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10%. Over the past decade, its payout ratio hit a high of 40.5% in 2020 and a low of 24.7% in 2021.  The bank’s CEO, Jamie Dimon, praised some of Donald Trump’s economic policies at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland in January. “Take a step back, be honest. He was kind of right about Nato, kind of right on immigration. He grew the economy quite well. Trade tax reform worked. He was right about some of China,” Financial Times reported Dimon’s comments. Although Dimon has said he’s a Democrat, it’s clear that he wants what’s best for himself and his bank. If that means easier banking regulations from a Republican administration, it’s easy to see why he would say this. It’s in his best interests. However, regardless of which party is in power, Dimon will still run America’s largest bank by assets, with $3.4 trillion as of April 2, 2024. If there is a “too big to fail” American bank, JPMorgan is it. It yields a respectable 2.31% and could soon be back on the list of dividend aristocrat bank stocks. With $2.54 trillion in assets, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) is the second-largest U.S. bank. Although it might be smaller than JPM, its dividend payout isn’t half bad. It has increased its dividend by 667% over the past decade from 12 cents in 2014 to 92 cents in 2023, a CAGR of 22.6%. Over the past decade, its payout ratio hit a high of 38.5% in 2020 and a low of 20.69% in 2018.  Bank of America is Berkshire Hathaway’s (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) second-largest holding in its $371 billion equity portfolio. The holding company owns 13.1% of the bank, a stake valued at $38.7 billion. Only it and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) account for more than 10% of Berkshire’s portfolio. Buffett’s next-largest bank stock is Capital One Financial (NYSE:COF), which accounts for just 0.5% of Berkshire’s portfolio, with a stake of 3.3% in the credit card provider. Capital One is currently attempting to acquire Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS) for $35 billion. Discover is one of America’s largest credit card companies. There is plenty of opposition to the transaction because of what it might do to fees while ratcheting up the risk in America’s financial services industry. Buffett loves dividends. Based on its annual dividend payout of 96 cents a share, Berkshire will receive approximately $992 million in dividends from its BAC investment in 2024. U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) has increased its dividend by 99% over the past decade from 97 cents in 2014 to $1.93 in 2023, a CAGR of 7.1%. Over the past decade, its payout ratio hit a high of 59.02% in 2023 and a low of 31.33% in 2014. It’s the weakest of the three banks on this list, with assets of $650.7 billion as of April 2, 2024, less than half the assets of Citigroup (NYSE:C), the fourth-largest by assets. Compared to both JPM and BAC, whose stocks are up 15.6% and 10%, respectively, year-to-date (YTD), it’s significantly underperforming, down 1.5% for the year.  But while it’s the ugly duckling of the three on this list, now might be a good time to buy its stock. On March 28, HSBC analysts upgraded USB stock to “Buy” from “Hold,” while increasing their target price by $6 to $53, 20% higher than where it’s currently trading. HSBC expects the bank’s profitability to improve in 2025, leading to an already attractive tangible return on common equity (ROTCE). Part of the issue with USB is that it’s in no-man’s land, caught between being “too big to fail” and the smaller regional banks. In 2024, due to the black cloud created by New York Community Bancorp’s (NYSE:NYCB) commercial loan losses, regional bank stocks suffered greatly. But yielding 4.53%, USB does have one of the highest yields amongst America’s largest banks.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is in the crosshairs. The consumer electronics company is under attack for antitrust violations. The Justice Dept. and 16 states are going after Apple stock for allegedly maintaining an illegal monopoly in the smartphone market. You know the thing that makes users value Apple’s ecosystem so highly? That all Apple products work seamlessly with one another without issue? Yeah, that’s what the government wants to tear down. Because the iPhone and Macbook are all in sync with iCloud, that makes it too hard for consumers to switch away from Apple and that apparently is not a good thing. Yet there are more allegations than just being too good at what it does, so let’s see if Apple stock can thrive if the government is trying to make it wilt. On Mar 21 Justice Dept. 16 state and district attorneys filed an antitrust lawsuit against Apple. According to the complaint, the tech giant monopolizes the smartphone market, or tries to do so, by undermining “apps, products, and services that would otherwise make users less reliant on the iPhone, promote interoperability, and lower costs for consumers and developers.”  Texting or sending pictures to Android devices, for example, isn’t as seamless as it is between Apple users. And Apple was famously sued by Fortnite maker Epic Games over fees developers pay and how they’re paid. That case, by the way, was largely found in favor of Apple. The court ruled Apple just can’t prevent app developers from publicizing there are other payment systems within the app instead of going through Apple. According to U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland, Apple leverages its monopoly power to “extract more money from consumers, developers, content creators, artists, publishers, small businesses, and merchants, among others.” Curiously, the complaint goes even further by alleging Apple’s sinister plan even stops parents from giving their kids Android phones! The scope of Apple’s power seemingly knows no bounds. Not surprisingly, trial lawyers smell money and leapt at the chance to ride the Justice Dept.’s coattails. At least three class-action lawsuits against Apple have been filed in response to the government’s allegations. Apple stock naturally (and in my opinion, rightly) says it will fight all of the charges. Noting the federal lawsuit “threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets…We believe this lawsuit is wrong on the facts and the law, and we will vigorously defend against it.”  The company adds it is a “dangerous precedent, empowering government to take a heavy hand in designing people’s technology.” Yet if these allegations are true, then Apple has to be one of the worst monopolists ever. The iPhone only has a 57% share of the U.S. market and 20% globally. That alone suggests the Justice Dept. is stretching the definition a bit thin. And while we might wish Apple products were more compatible with Android devices, must companies be forced to make their products work with their competitors’ devices? After all, you’re not going to find much compatibility between Chevy and Ford (NYSE:F) parts. It should also be noted that Justice Dept. lawyers don’t stay up-to-date on what is occurring in the tech world. They charge Apple with “suppressing mobile cloud streaming services” blithely unaware that Apple changed its policies around that issue earlier this year. The feds also say Apple’s CarPlay infotainment app will takeover a vehicle’s screens and sensors for an iPhone-like experience but apparently ignore a carmaker’s ability to limit the interface. General Motors (NYSE:GM), for instance, has blocked all phone-mirroring services.  Apple has sufficient financial wherewithal to fight this government intrusion and overreach, which will undoubtedly drag on for years. Apple stock, though down 11% year-to-date, will shrug off this lawsuit. The stock did fall sharply on the news. The tech company’s woes stem more from slowing sales, tough competition and a China market preferring more homegrown options. The antitrust lawsuit is an unneeded distraction but not one investors should be overly concerned with.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Being the king of AI chip stocks, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is surely a piping hot stock every long-term growth investor is itching to own. Surging nearly 250% in 2023, Nvidia stock is up more than 85% year-to-date, and showing not signs of slowing down anytime soon. Of course, most of this drastic valuation increase has to do with Nvidia’s stranglehold on the high-performance computing market. The company’s AI semiconductors and GPUs are the dominant option for companies worldwide looking to create AI applications and run interfaces in this high-growth space. Until that changes, this rally really does look unstoppable. Today, most sectors, whether it’s from in technology or elsewhere, are looking to pivot into AI or integrate AI into their processes. Analysts predict the AI market could reach $2 trillion by 2030, with plenty of value being accrued to the current dominant leader in this space. Here’s why I think Nvidia’s current multiple has been validated by the market, and could actually represent a reasonable level, given the company’s noted ability to outperform in terms of its fundamentals.  Tech giants everywhere are collaborating to counter Nvidia’s AI dominance. This speaks to the company’s dominant position in this space, resulting in the formation of the Unified Acceleration Foundation (UXL). The coalition, including Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and others, aims to develop open-source software enabling AI code to run universally. This group targets a mature project phase by year-end. After reaching a $2 trillion market cap, Nvidia stock is more driven to create AI-focused hardware that can be even better than its existing H100 and H200 chips. Despite Nvidia’s dominance with CUDA architecture, rivals are developing alternatives amid chip scarcity. UXL aims to create open-source solutions for AI and computing, seeking collaboration from chipmakers and cloud giants—Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) rumored partnership with AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) is yet another example of competitive interests lining up against Nvidia stock. I think this reality is largely bullish for Nvidia right now. It showcases the company’s dominance, and while other lower-priced options are necessary, means that Nvidia’s positioning in the high-performance computing space will be hard to challenge. I think Nvidia’s moat is only getting wider, with the release of its recent Blackwell GPU the latest innovation to turn heads. The previous year, Nvidia dominated the AI chip market with an estimated 90% share, leading to remarkable earnings. In its latest quarter (Q4 of fiscal 2024, ending in January), revenue surged by 265% to $22 billion, with operating income soaring by 983% to nearly $14 billion. This growth was fueled by a 409% increase in data center revenue, driven by AI GPU sales. The company’s free cash flow skyrocketed by 430% to over $27 billion, surpassing AMD’s $1 billion and Intel’s notable $14 billion. Despite the competition’s new GPU releases, Nvidia’s AI advantage likely propelled it ahead, ensuring robust cash reserves for continued innovation and market leadership. Moreover, the company now sits in third place in the race to be the world’s most valuable company, just behind Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft.  Despite this rapid growth, Nvidia’s stock has appreciated over the past year. Key valuation metrics like the price-earnings ratio and price-to-free-cash-flow ratio indicate favorable investment potential, coupled with its leading position in a thriving industry and substantial cash reserves. During an Nvidia event last week, Jensen Huang introduced Blackwell, Nvidia’s revolutionary GPU architecture, poised to redefine computing. Named after David Blackwell, this ambitious project marks a significant milestone in Silicon Valley’s history. Nvidia exceeded Q4 earnings estimates, soaring revenue by 265% to $22.1 billion. The company anticipates 2024 sales of around $24 billion and an implied bottom line of $5.41 per share. Analyst Timothy Arcuri raised Nvidia’s price target to $1,100, citing an expected surge in demand. Arcuri likened the framework to a centralized distribution system akin to an app store, foreseeing significant revenue potential from licensing Nvidia’s AI Enterprise software at $4,500 per GPU per year. He advocated for capitalizing on any short-term declines as buying opportunities. Nvidia has clearly emerged as a leading AI stock, and while some of the stock’s recent rise can be tied to hype, most of this company’s performance is fundamentals-based. Indeed, despite surging roughly more than three-fold over the past 18 months, this is a stock that still looks reasonably-valued based on its forward-looking prospects.  The data center and professional visualization segments saw remarkable sales growth of over 400% and 100% year-over-year. Additionally, Nvidia announced its inaugural quarterly dividend, offering investors promising fundamentals and growth prospects, particularly in the AI sector. For long-term investors, Nvidia remains the go-to option in this space. I just don’t see that changing, for at least the next decade. Accordingly, I think investors would do well to consider this stock on dips moving forward.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips There are many paths investors can take to profit on Wall Street but one of the best strategies is buying dividend stocks. History shows that income stocks outperform all other stocks. Going as far back as 1930, there has never been a losing decade for dividend stocks on the S&P 500. Dividend Aristocrats are the cream of income-generating stocks. These are companies that not only pay a dividend but have raised their payouts for 25 years or more. Moreover, to qualify for the list, they also have to be a component of the S&P 500 index. Only 67 stocks out of the thousands that trade on the market have made the cut. Yet the list is always changing. Some companies cross that 25-year threshold and received the crown. Others fall by the wayside because they can’t maintain their payments. Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) was kicked out earlier this year after it slashed its payout to save money. Below are seven of the best stocks close to becoming Dividend Aristocrats. Consider buying them for your own portfolio.  Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is the largest defense contractor with virtually all of its $67.6 billion in annual revenue derived from government contracts. The military and aerospace leader is involved in all the major military programs. It builds F-16 and F22 fighter jets, F-35 stealth fighters, the Patriot missile systems, Javelin anti-tank weapons systems, Black Hawk helicopters, Trident ballistic missiles, and NASA’s Orion spacecraft. Many of these weapons and defense systems are also sold to foreign governments. Not surprisingly, constructing the global war machine is extremely profitable. LMT stock’s net earnings last year totalled $6.9 billion, or $27.55 per share, up 21% from last year. The defense giant pays a dividend that totals $12.60 per share annually and yields a healthy 2.8%. As Lockheed generates generous amounts of free cash flow, some $6.2 billion in 2023, the dividend is well covered. And with a free cash flow (FCF) payout ratio of 49%, there is plenty of room for future growth. Last October, Lockheed raised the dividend for the 21st consecutive year. It only needs to do that four more times to reach Aristocrat status, which seems easily within the defense behemoth’s reach. Everyone knows Clorox (NYSE:CLX) for its namesake bleach but the consumer products leader has a portfolio of other brands including Pine-Sol cleaners, Kingsford charcoal and Glad storage bags. Clorox products tend to be the leading brands in their respective markets and generate 80% of its $7.4 billion in annual net sales from brands holding  the No. 1 or No. 2 market share position.  After a rough couple of years following the pandemic boom, Clorox then suffered a major cyberattack last August that disrupted supply chains, interfered with production and caused product shortages. Now CLX stock is on the mend. Shares are up 6% in 2024 and it is enjoying 20% non-GAAP organic sales growth for the first half of its current fiscal year. The consumer products company is rebuilding inventories ahead of schedule, driving top line growth and rebuilding margins. Gross margins jumped 730 basis points in the fiscal second quarter, hitting 43.5%. There is still work to do but Clorox’s dividend remains secure. The bleach maker has increased the payout for 21 straight years and with a free cash flow payout ratio of 62%, there is sufficient cushion for additional growth and expansion. Chipmaker Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is the third stock on the brink of becoming a Dividend Aristocrat. The smartphone chip supplier for both Android and iOS devices also has a 21-year record of raising its dividend, which yields 1.9% annually. We’ve been focusing on the free cash flow payout ratio with these candidates because companies can only do so much with the money they have left over after paying their bills. Rewarding shareholders with dividends is one of them. For Qualcomm, it uses just 35% of its FCF meaning there is little danger of the dividend being cut.  That’s because the chipmaker’s business is booming. Perhaps not so much as rival Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), but fiscal first quarter results showed revenue jumped to $9.9 billion primarily due to 16% growth in its handset chip business. Even as the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 15 ramp settles down, Samsung’s Galaxy S24 smartphone should provide the next leg of its road higher. The chipmaker is also benefiting from a recovery of demand in China. Sure, QCOM stock is no Nvidia but it doesn’t have to be and it remains a solid semiconductor stock to buy. Footwear maker Nike (NYSE:NKE) has been a laggard in 2024 with its stock down a harsh 15%. It is one of the worst-performing S&P 500 stocks due to stiff competition from competing shoemakers, like Deckers Outdoor (NASDAQ:DECK) Hoka brand and Adidas (OTCMKTS:ADDYY). Business in China is also slow. Yet things may be changing up for the sports apparel company. Although it is still sorting through focusing on direct-to-consumer outlets versus the wholesale market, China is rebounding. Fiscal third-quarter earnings showed currency-adjusted sales up 6% there with revenue across the nine months of its fiscal year running 8% higher. NKE stock is down 28% from its recent high but now trades at some of its lowest levels in years. On a price-to-sales basis, the stock is about where it was a decade ago, and it’s no different with its price-to-earnings ratio.  Some might say the discount is appropriate because of its slowed momentum but it continues to produce substantial cash flows. While Nike has raised its dividend for 22  years running, over the past five years it has been increasing it at a 10% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR). FCF has expanded at a similar CAGR and with a 41% FCF payout ratio, NKE stock’s dividend has more room to move. Electric power utility Southern (NYSE:SO) should be a surprise member of the soon-to-be Dividend Aristocrat list. Utilities are cherished for their stable growth and dividend payments, which is why they were often considered widows-and-orphans stocks. Southern is a gas and electric utility generating power for across much of the south, appropriately enough. It also operates nuclear power facilities and put Plant Vogtle Unit 3 into operation last July. The plant is the first new construction facility in the U.S. in over 30 years. It anticipates putting Unit 4 into service some time in the second quarter. Over the past decade, SO stock delivered 135% total return for investors. While that is below the average of the S&P 500, you don’t buy into utilities for their growth momentum but the surety of its dividend payments. Southern’s dividend yields 3.9% annually and the company has grown the payout for 22 consecutive years. Nuclear power is back into vogue. An all-of-the-above solution is needed as energy demands exceed the capacity of renewables. Expect SO stock and its dividend to keep growing.  At this mature stage of its lifecycle, it remains surprising to see Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) reinvent itself once again. As InvestorPlace’s Louis Navellier recently noted, the tech giant may be the ultimate artificial intelligence (AI) growth play for the next decade.” Having integrated AI into the very fabric of its operations, MSFT stock is now joined at the hip with this technological leap forward. Microsoft invested billions of dollars in OpenAI and put its ChatGPT generative AI to work in Bing search, the Office suite of products and its fast-growing Azure cloud services business. It has given the tech leader a new lease on life and accelerated its potential. Microsoft is now the world’s most valuable company with a $3.1 trillion valuation. This potential could equally apply to the dividend, which Microsoft has increased every year after initiating the payout in 2003. The company generates massive FCF, so $63 billion worth last year. It’s grown FCF 9% annually for the past decade, an amazing achievement considering this company’s size. That puts its FCF payout ratio at just 33%, which ensures investors will enjoy future increases for years to come. The last stock to consider buying before it becomes a Dividend Aristocrat is another utility, this one serving the New England states of Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire. Eversource Energy (NYSE:ES) is on the doorstep of aristocracy after raising the payout in February by almost 6% to 71.5 cents per share. That gives it a 24-year history of increasing its dividend. This time next year could see it rubbing elbows with its royal neighbors. Investors might see their holdings significantly higher too. After a steady climb higher, ES stock stagnated during the pandemic and has since been in decline. It’s down 40% from its March 2020 high. The stock is down 24% in the last year alone. The regulated utility is reeling from exiting several offshore wind projects last year and took a $1.6 billion charge in the fourth quarter. It is also in the process of selling its 50% interest in the Sunrise Wind project in New York.  Eversource had been one of the first utilities to pursue wind energy projects but decided to completely abandon them two years ago. It should be fully free of the clean energy option when the Sunrise Wind project goes through. Now it will focus completely on its utility operations and can finance their transmission and distribution growth projects that will better earn a steady regulated return. The stock is already up 13% from its 52-week lows. With a narrow focus on core operations, analysts are upbeat it can continue growing its dividend and rewarding shareholders.

      "(RTTNews) - Apple Inc. (AAPL) has announced its plan to showcase iOS 18, along with updates for its entire product lineup, at the upcoming developer's conference in June. According to rumors circulating in the tech community, the iOS 18 update will be available for all iPhone models that support iOS 17. However, some older iPad models may not be compatible with iOS 18. MacRumors, a popular website that covers news and rumors related to Apple products, recently obtained an image from an anonymous source who claimed to have received it from an iOS engineer. Although MacRumors is not able to verify the authenticity of the image, they believe that it will be included in the iOS 18 Apple Design Resources. If the image is genuine, it suggests that iOS 18 will borrow design elements from visionOS, a cutting-edge operating system that powers the Vision Pro headset. Earlier this year, The Verifier, an Israeli website, reported that iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 would feature design elements inspired by visionOS. The Vision Pro headset's OS boasts a high level of depth translucency, with glass-like buttons that have reflective edges. MacRumors maintains that this recent leak confirms past rumors, indicating that the Apple TV app on iPadOS 18 will have a translucent navigation bar. In addition to these design changes, reports suggest that iOS 18 will also introduce new AI features, potentially incorporating Google's Gemini technology. Apple is expected to showcase iOS 18 at the WWDC on June 10, with the first beta release following shortly thereafter. Overall, Apple fans have much to look forward to with the upcoming product updates and features.\n"

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips When it comes to picking stocks, all of us want to ensure capital gains and steady returns. While the market cannot be timed, it is possible to pick stocks that have the potential to keep thriving, no matter the circumstances. Some companies have established themselves so well in the industry that no pandemic, war, or inflationary pressures can tamper its growth. Such blue-chip stocks to buy for under $500 in April can be an ideal addition to your portfolio before the companies announce results. Starting with $500? Buying these blue-chip gems right now will ensure you make the most of the upside in the coming months. While a few are nearing their 52-week highs, some are nearing the 52-week lows, giving you a chance to grab them at a discount. These stocks can survive any hail or storm and will end 2024 on a high note. Tech dinosaur Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the best blue-chip stocks to own. Trading at $424, the stock is up 14% year to date (YTD) and 47% in the year. Known for the operating system, Microsoft has become an integral part of our lives. It offers a wide range of products and services that cater to individuals and businesses. The Magnificent Seven stock could soar over $500 this year.  Its timely investments in OpenAI have helped the company integrate AI into its products and services which has reflected in the strong financials. Also, it launched AI for cybersecurity professionals this month. The company’s cloud business is one of the biggest revenue generators. It has shown a 24% growth in the recent quarter and came in at $33.7 billion out of the total company sales of $62 billion. Companies are willing to pay for their AI tools. So this is proof that it has been successful in the integration of AI into its products. Additionally, MSFT saw profit margins expand in Q2 and reported a net profit margin of over 25%. And, it can expand the margins further while steadily growing revenue. Finally, the company is well-positioned for the present and the future. Its AI prowess will ensure that it makes the most of the business opportunities. As one of the most valuable firms, Microsoft stock is a solid addition for all types of investors and will continue to reward them. A lot of people think Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is in trouble but don’t make the mistake of believing them. The company is indeed facing a lot of challenges at this point, but it has the potential to bounce back. While it has seen a drop in iPhone sales in China, it could only be temporary, and the sales could pick up soon. Also, the company is working on updating the operating system to iOS 18 and integrating AI into its phones. A dip in quarterly sales doesn’t mean that the company is losing the market. In fact, Apple has enough liquidity to keep going, and its services segment is growing at a record pace.  Down 8% YTD, APPL stock is getting close to its 52-week low of $159 – a solid chance to load up. Trading for $170 today, it has been on a downward spree since announcing quarterly results. With a drop in inflation, we can expect an improvement in consumer spending. So this could lead to an improvement in iPhone shipments. Also, the company is in talks to build the Gemini AI engine in its phone. While there hasn’t been a huge leap in terms of product features and improvements in the iPhone for several years, the company could bring something new this year and change the narrative. In short, it is too soon to give up on Apple stock right now. It is an attractive play with the potential to reward patient investors. E-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has come a long way from its humble beginning as a bookseller. The company is so much more than just an e-commerce business and has gained significant market share through its cloud services, Amazon Web Services (AWS). Currently, AWS holds a 31% market share. Amazon has always used AI to enhance customer experience, an investment that is paying off. It will invest an additional $2.75 billion in Anthropic, an AI startup company to advance its commitment towards generative AI.  AMZN stock is a blue-chip gem you should buy and hold forever. The company is one of the largest e-commerce companies and it provides everything online, including cars. Its cloud business is thriving and the advertising segment is going to become huge in the next two years. With the number of people visiting Amazon, marketers will be ready to pay for a top spot on the platform and this will ensure higher advertising revenue. The company will also spend $150 billion on data centers over the next decade to maintain its position in the cloud sector. When it comes to innovation, Amazon is the best out there. It reported impressive fourth-quarter results driven by holiday sales. Currently, the stock is trading at $180. While it is close to the 52-week high of $183, it could exceed $200 this year.

      "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips The stock market is dragging Monday’s losses into Tuesday as Treasury yields rise to their highest level all year. Why are stocks down today? Well, it appears investors are continuing to show concerns that interest rate cuts may not arrive until the second half of the year. With jobs data coming in strong this morning, as inflation proves more stubborn that predicted, some economists believe the Federal Reserve is being granted further leeway to hold off cutting rates. This includes former Fed president Dennis P. Lockhart.  “As long as the economy is tolerating this level of interest rates and the progress is slow at best in disinflationary terms, I don’t see them moving,” Lockhart told Yahoo Finance, referring to the chance of a rate cut at the upcoming Fed policy meeting. At the time of writing, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are down 0.74% and 0.93%, respectively. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is on track to be the day’s biggest loser, however, it is down 0.98% heading to the bell. The 10-year Treasury yield is trending around 4.37% today, its highest level in 2024, potentially reflecting a sort of “flight-to-safety” trade as investors ditch relatively high-risk stocks for guaranteed fixed-income assets. This marks the second straight day of losses for the widely watched indices, fueling concerns that stocks’ strong first-quarter performance may be erased in a cold second-quarter reversal. Once-darling electric vehicle (EV) maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) continues to lead the bears, down more than 5% today after announcing it delivered fewer cars than expected in its first quarter.  Tesla is the biggest S&P 500 loser this year, having shed nearly 40% of its weight, equivalent to more than $230 billion in lost value. With Tesla, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) underperforming the market this year, some analysts have started dropping the “Magnificent Seven,” the name for the top seven tech stocks. Instead, replacing the term with the “Fabulous Four,” consisting of just Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). “If you’d have told me eight weeks ago that Apple and Tesla would be down as much as they are, oh and by the way, you’re punting when you’re going to do the rate cuts and you’re getting less rate cuts, I would have assumed the market would be down,” Ryan Detrick, Chief Market Strategist at Carson Group, told the Wall Street Journal.
