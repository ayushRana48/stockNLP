2,AMZN,3 Biggest Value Investing Mistakes,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-biggest-value-investing-mistakes-143700118.html,"(0:30) - Learning from Warren Buffett’s Mistakes (11:10) - Stocks To Keep On Your Watchlist (26:00) - Episode Roundup: IBM, AMZN, CVX, BAC, AAPL Podcast@Zacks.com  Welcome to Episode #363 of the Value Investor Podcast. Everyone makes mistakes in investing, even the world’s greatest living investor, Warren Buffett. He’s been investing for over 80 years so there are bound to be a few blow ups along the way. What can we learn from his biggest mistakes? 1.       Buying in a difficult industry where there are few moats 2.       Holding the company too long, even when the business has changed or its not performing 3.       Buying an expensive stock Berkshire Hathaway first bought shares of IBM in 2011 around $170 a share. By 2018, Berkshire had sold out of the investment in the range of $140 to $150. Berkshire took a loss. Buffett later said IBM wasn’t performing as he thought it would and that’s why he got out. But it took him 8 years to finally exit the position completely. During that period, IBM’s earnings fell year-over-year in 2014, 2015 and 2016 with little rebound in 2017 and 2018. Should Buffett had sold earlier when falling earnings became more than just a 1-off at IBM? Berkshire Hathaway bought Bank of America in the third quarter of 2017. It still owns a big position. Earnings at Bank of America popped during the pandemic, rising to $3.56 in 2021 from $1.87 in 2020. But earnings are expected to fall this year by 9%. Bank of America is still cheap with a P/B ratio of just 1.1. Is Buffett making a mistake in still holding Bank of America? Berkshire Hathaway first bought Amazon shares in the first quarter of 2019. It’s a small position in the equity portfolio. At the time, many were confused by the purchase because Amazon sported a sky-high P/E ratio and didn’t seem to be a traditional “value” stock. Amazon is cheaper now, with a forward P/E of 44. Earnings plunged in 2022, but they have been rebounding. In 2023, Amazon made $2.80 per share and the Zacks Consensus is looking for $4.08 in 2024. Shares are up 105.2% since the last day of the first quarter of 2019 through Apr 2, 2024. That’s beating the S&P 500, up 84.4% during the same time. Was Amazon too expensive when Buffett bought it in 2019? Berkshire Hathaway first bought shares of Chevron in the fourth quarter of 2020 and then bought a bigger position in 2021. At the time, Chevron was dirt cheap on a fundamental basis. It remains cheap, with a forward P/E of 12. Chevron shares are up 90.3% since the last day of the fourth quarter of 2020. That easily beats the return of the S&P 500 during that same time of 39.1%. Does it pay to buy the dirt-cheap stocks like Chevron over the long term? Berkshire Hathaway first bought shares of Apple in the first quarter of 2016. It has since become a cornerstone of the Berkshire business and is the largest position in the equity portfolio. Shares are no longer cheap, however. When Berkshire originally bought, Apple was trading around 10x forward earnings. It is currently trading at 25.8x. But earnings growth has stalled out the last few years. Apple made $6.11 in fiscal 2022 and $6.12 in fiscal 2023. It’s expected to see some growth in fiscal 2024 as the Zacks Consensus is looking for $6.55. Is Apple flashing the warnings signs that maybe it’s business is changing? Tune into this week’s podcast to find out.  "
3,AMZN,"Amazon's AI Eyesore. After Just Walk Out Fail, Should Investors Be Worried?",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazons-ai-eyesore-just-walk-143000045.html,"Amazon has pushed back on that claim, but the company does seem to be largely stepping back from its Just Walk Out technology, which at the time of launch appeared to be as disruptive as anything else that had come out of Amazon. Licensing it to other retailers also seemed like a viable, potentially multi-billion-dollar revenue stream. Those hopes now seem totally dashed. So what does all this mean for investors considering Amazon stock? Let's dive in. Whether or not it's true that 70% of Just Walk Out transactions were verified in India, Amazon is pulling the technology from its Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods grocery stores in the U.S. A little more than half of Amazon Fresh stores had Just Walk Out installed only recently. The technology will remain in the Amazon Go convenience stores. Rather than using Just Walk Out, Amazon is leaning into its smart Dash Carts, which have a scanner and screen contained in the shopping cart so they can track your purchases as you shop and show you how much you've spent. Amazon sees these carts as a more reliable and practical solution, and they give shoppers the ability to see how much they're spending as they shop, which Just Walk Out does not do. Under CEO Andy Jassy, who took over from Jeff Bezos in 2021, Amazon has focused more on cost-cutting and driving profitability rather than innovating -- its historical strength. Scaling back the Just Walk Out technology seems like a logical step under that regime as the technology was not living up to its promise. But it also represents a significant failure in an area of artificial intelligence where Amazon seemed to have an advantage. Other signs have emerged that call Amazon's AI strategy into doubt. The company just announced it was cutting several hundred jobs at its Amazon Web Services cloud computing division, a sign that growth in that segment may not be living up to expectations. Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this: "
4,AMZN,"Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is favoured by institutional owners who hold 62% of the company",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-com-inc-nasdaq-amzn-140022347.html,"Significantly high institutional ownership implies Amazon.com's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions A total of 25 investors have a majority stake in the company with 46% ownership Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute. In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Amazon.com. Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices. We can see that Amazon.com does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Amazon.com, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too. Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Amazon.com. From our data, we infer that the largest shareholder is Jeffrey Bezos (who also holds the title of Top Key Executive) with 9.0% of shares outstanding. Its usually considered a good sign when insiders own a significant number of shares in the company, and in this case, we're glad to see a company insider play the role of a key stakeholder. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 7.4% and 6.0% of the stock. Our studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder. While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too. While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves. I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions. The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 27% stake in Amazon.com. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders. While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. "
5,AMZN,Amazon Eyes Record High as It Rebounds From Post-Pandemic Rout,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-eyes-record-high-rebounds-133410160.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Wall Street investors are finally doing what analysts have been recommending all along: buying Amazon.com Inc. Most Read from Bloomberg The shares of the e-commerce and cloud computing giant rose as much as 1.2% to $187.29 on Monday, putting the stock on track to surpass its closing high of $186.57 set in July 2021, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. While fellow mega-cap technology behemoths including Meta Platforms Inc., Microsoft Corp., and Nvidia Corp. have breached record highs in recent months, Amazon has lagged the pack as it nursed itself back from a post-pandemic selloff of about 57%. The stock has long been the most loved equity by brokers, with 67 analysts urging investors to buy and the remaining two with a hold-equivalent rating. However, investors have looked for more than just analysts’ recommendations to come back around. To win over investors, the company has been relentlessly cutting costs and restructuring its business, while demand for AI is also starting to boost its bottom line. Amazon Web Services, its once fast-growing cloud unit, also showed signs of re-acceleration in the last quarter, assuaging some fears of a demand slowdown. Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak said that that upside to retail profits is giving more confidence in the e-commerce giant’s ability to deliver strong Ebit and free cash flow in the coming years. Nowak hiked the price target on the stock to $215 from $200 in a note dated Sunday, implying a 16% increase from the last close. Analysts on average have a target of about $209, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek ©2024 Bloomberg L.P. "

7,AMZN,3 Millionaire-Maker Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-millionaire-maker-artificial-intelligence-111500783.html,"According to Grand View Research, the AI market hit a valuation nearing $200 billion in 2023 and is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% through 2030. The trajectory will see the industry reach nearly $2 trillion by the end of the decade, suggesting that the market is nowhere near hitting its ceiling and it's not too late to invest in AI. So, here are three millionaire-maker artificial intelligence stocks to buy right now. In its most recent quarter (the fourth quarter of 2024, which ended in January), Nvidia's revenue increased by 265% year over year to $22 billion. This monster growth was primarily thanks to a 409% increase in data center revenue, reflecting a spike in AI GPU sales. Nvidia remains on a promising growth path, and earnings per share (EPS) estimates seem to support its potential. AMD was slightly late to the AI party as Nvidia beat it to the market. However, AMD is investing heavily in the industry and has formed some lucrative partnerships that could take it far in AI over the long term. AMD's earnings have yet to reflect its investment in AI. However, its recent quarterly earnings suggest it's moving in the right direction. In its fourth quarter of 2023, AMD's revenue rose 10% year over year to $6 billion, beating analysts' expectations by about $60 million. The company's AI-focused data center segment posted 38% revenue growth. The company has leading positions in multiple tech areas, including e-commerce, the cloud market, gaming, consumer products, and more. However, all eyes have been on Amazon's AI efforts over the last year. As the operator of the world's biggest cloud service, Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company has the potential to leverage its massive cloud data centers and steer the generative AI market. In 2023, AWS responded to increased demand for AI services by introducing a variety of new tools. Amazon is even using AI to boost its retail site and announced an AI shopping assistant dubbed Rufus ahead of its latest earnings release. Amazon is moving to become a major threat in AI over the long term, but it also has a lucrative retail business that makes its stock too good to pass up. Amazon's earnings are expected to reach nearly $7 per share over the next two fiscal years. In a similar calculation to Nvidia and AMD, multiplying that figure by the retail giant's forward P/E of 43 yields a stock price of $301, which could see its shares increase by 65% by fiscal 2026. As a result, Amazon is a millionaire-maker stock worth considering in 2024. Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this: "
8,AMZN,3 Ground Rules I Now Set When Shopping on Amazon,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-ground-rules-now-set-110015861.html,"Some people may not get a lot of good use out of their Amazon Prime memberships. But I can say with certainty that the $139 annual fee I pay for the program is not money I'm throwing away. Amazon is one of those sites you might easily browse when you're bored or waiting around for a friend. I used to do the same, but I don't anymore. The reason? There's just too much temptation. As a Prime member, I can order any item for free two-day shipping. A $12 t-shirt here or an $8 hat there may not seem like a big deal. But in the course of a year, those little purchases can add up. So now, I only visit Amazon when there's a specific item I need. And when I do, I don't browse the daily deals. I just stick to the item or items I'm looking for. Similarly, I won't shop on Amazon during special events, like Prime Day, unless there's a reason to. Otherwise, I know I'm likely to be tempted to buy something. I've found that Amazon sells a variety of decent-quality clothing items at low prices. So on occasion, I'll be tempted to purchase a new fleece jacket to go running in, or new socks or pajamas. But as someone who tends to keep her clothing for a really long time, my new rule is that I can't buy clothing on Amazon unless it's to replace something specific in my closet. The way I see it, if I'm not replacing an item I already own, then the item in question is probably something I don't actually need. If there's an item on Amazon I need in a pinch, I may have to order it for two-day delivery, which I get for free as a Prime member. But for non-urgent purchases, my new rule is to always see if the item in question is available via the Subscribe & Save program. The program allows you to set up items to ship to you automatically at different intervals, such as once a month, once every other month, and so forth. And you'll generally snag a discount on the things you're buying if you use Subscribe & Save. So if there's no rush for your new face cream or toothpaste or vitamins, why not save money on them? Shopping on Amazon may hurt your finances if you aren't careful. It pays to do what you can to avoid impulse buys on the site. And it pays to seek out savings where you can, such as looking to the Subscribe & Save program for the things you don't need immediately. If you feel that your Amazon spending has been excessive lately, you may want to implement your own set of rules for shopping on the site. You may find that it does your finances a lot of good. "
9,AMZN,Can This Discount Retail Company Beat Amazon At Its Own Game?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/discount-retail-company-beat-amazon-104500251.html,"If most companies bought five commercial slots during the Super Bowl only to run the same ad five times, it would seem like a waste. When Temu did it this year, it was just a reminder of its business model. The Chinese e-commerce challenger is trying to become a household name among American consumers by focusing on sheer volume rather than quality to increase its market share. Is Temu's low-cost platform a threat to Amazon's e-commerce profitability? And will it become a staple of U.S. shopping or fade away after the hype dies down? The answer to these two questions could give a hint as to the long-term investment potential of PDD's stock. However, this did little to damage Amazon at the time, as the company's sales rose 20% in 2019. AliExpress, on the other hand, never achieved real mainstream consumer popularity in the United States. This was partly due to a propensity for scammers, but mainly a lack of successful marketing. Today, AliExpress fills a niche as a popular platform for ""dropshippers""  facilitating the resale of large quantities of Chinese goods on Amazon for a generous mark-up. Temu specializes in offering the cheapest possible version of every good a consumer can imagine. This business model isn't anything new, especially not to the American customer base. Between AliExpress, Chinese fashion retailer Shein, and domestic e-commerce company Wish, American shoppers know the reality of ""you get what you pay for."" The introductions of these platforms have all been shrugged off by Amazon's business model of premium services through Amazon Prime and a well-managed e-commerce store. As such, it's unlikely that Temu will steal much revenue from Amazon, as the two companies approach online retail in fundamentally different ways. Temu does, however, pose a threat to the aforementioned dropshippers, as it essentially cuts them out of the process. Instead of American customers buying a needlessly marked-up Chinese product on Amazon through a reseller, they can now go straight to the source with Temu. With estimates showing nearly 70% of all products sold on Amazon are made in China, Temu could ultimately offer all of those same products for cheaper by subverting Amazon resellers. Don't worry too much about Amazon, though. The customers who generate the most revenue for Amazon e-commerce are those focused on quality products at competitive prices. And Amazon's focus on Amazon Web Services and cloud computing ensures its trajectory will remain positive. It's clear from Temu's website that it does not currently offer the inventory that would attract such shoppers. Currently, there exist three major threats to Temu's longevity and relevance in the e-commerce space. The first is tensions between the U.S. government and Chinese companies, particularly ByteDance and its TikTok platform. With the U.S. Senate currently reviewing a bill that would force ByteDance to divest TikTok, the U.S. is signaling a renewed willingness to hamstring Chinese corporations that wish to take advantage of the U.S. market. Temu could one day become another TikTok should U.S. regulators decide to review its data harvesting, tariff evasion, and political connections. The second risk lies in Temu's unsustainable business model. Currently, it is impossible to determine the amount of money Temu is making or losing, due to PDD Holdings' nebulous reporting of operating profit. However, several analysts postulate the company is losing anywhere between $500 million and $1 billion annually on Temu. This can be attributed to Temu's unprofitable pricing, which is purposely rock-bottom to win over customers in the short term. The company also presently lacks the warehousing infrastructure needed to expand and accelerate sales within the United States. The third risk is an age-old one in the world of emerging businesses -- reputation. Business owners, customers, and investors all rely on the reputation of a company to determine its value, and Temu's reputation has suffered since entering the mainstream e-commerce space. A C+ rating from the Better Business Bureau and several complaints to the Federal Trade Commission regarding copyright infringement and counterfeit products make the site questionable at best. I would unequivocally say no. Though PDD Holdings has shown strong performance over the last couple of years, its long-term potential is dubious at best. For starters, American investors can only purchase American Depository Receipts tied to PDD on the New York Stock Exchange. This means no amount of money spent investing in PDD will ever correlate to public ownership rights. This isn't an issue when investing in reputable foreign companies, but it is especially risky considering the nature of China's business environment. As a command economy under a communist regime, ADRs in China are subject to heavy government interference, should the company step out of line with the party.

10,AMZN,3 Supercharged Tech Stocks to Buy Without any Hesitation,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-supercharged-tech-stocks-buy-101500335.html,"Some already have shown their strength in recent times, advancing even after their top performances last year. So, just because a stock has gained in the double or even triple digits doesn't mean it's too late to buy that particular player. It's essential to take a look at the company's earnings track record, future prospects, and market position. Using these as a guide, investors can determine whether the stock has what it takes to generate more gains. These days, if a company has a strong presence in the high-growth area of artificial intelligence (AI), it scores extra points. (The AI market is expected to reach more than $1 trillion by the end of the decade.) Let's check out three supercharged tech stocks that easily pass this test, making them stocks to buy without any hesitation. Just recently, Nvidia announced much-anticipated news: It plans to release its new Blackwell architecture, which includes six technological innovations, later this year. Among these innovations are the world's most powerful chip and a second-generation transformer engine that will help Blackwell support double the computing power of its predecessors. The Blackwell platform also allows users to run generative AI at as much as 25 times lower cost and energy consumption compared to the previous platform. This has helped Meta grow revenue and profit, and the tech company reached a new level of strength recently, saying it's confident it can continue to grow and reward investors; so it launched its first dividend. Meta is going all in on AI. Eventually, users of its products and services can rely on AI tools there to enrich their experiences. With all of this in mind, Meta is dirt cheap for 25 times forward-earnings estimates. The e-commerce and cloud-computing giant struggled with higher inflation back in 2022 but quickly turned things around by revamping its cost structure -- a move that should help Amazon excel in any environment. Last year, Amazon's revenue climbed in the double digits, and it returned to profitability after a loss in 2022 -- the company's first net loss in almost a decade. Moving forward, Amazon should benefit from its dominance in the high-growth businesses of e-commerce and cloud computing, as well as its presence in AI. Amazon is using AI to improve its operations, leading to cost savings, and the company is selling AI products and services to clients through its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business. Both of these efforts should result in earnings growth in the near and long term. That's why Amazon doesn't look expensive today, trading at 42 times forward-earnings estimates. It's a stock I'd buy with no hesitation. Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this: "

12,AMZN,"This ""Magnificent Seven"" Stock Just Hit an All-Time High and Could Soar a Lot More, According to 4 Wall Street Analysts",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/magnificent-seven-stock-just-hit-095000304.html,"It wasn't all that long ago that many investors had seemingly given up on Meta. In 2022, the company's earnings growth was anemic. Some viewed Facebook as yesterday's news with ByteDance's TikTok on the rise. Skepticism was high, to say the least, about CEO Mark Zuckerberg's big bet on building the metaverse. After an especially disappointing quarterly update in February 2022, Meta's share price plunged 26% in one day, wiping out $251 billion of the company's market cap. In the stock market's history, no company had lost that much value on a dollar basis in a single trading day. By November 2022, Meta's shares were down 75% below the previous high. That was then. Meta is now on a roll -- a huge one. Since bottoming out in late 2022, the social media stock has skyrocketed over 450%. Meta's shares are up close to 49% so far this year. Can Meta's major momentum continue? At least four analysts think so. While not quite as bullish about Meta as the other Wall Street pros, Jefferies analysts are decidedly enthusiastic about the stock. They wrote in a note to investors last week that ""Meta has too many advantages to count."" Wall Street pros don't know what the future holds any more than you or I do. It's possible that Meta won't come close to delivering the kind of gains analysts predict over the next 12 months. However, I think Wall Street's optimism about the stock is warranted over the long term. Facebook remains much more resilient than many might have expected a few years ago. The social media platform had 2.11 billion average daily active users in December 2023, up 6% year over year. Across all of Meta's platforms, the average daily active user count was 3.19 billion, an increase of 8% from the prior-year period. Meta continues to do a great job at monetizing this massive global audience. Ad impressions have risen. Facebook and Instagram Reels have become a key revenue source. Business messaging on WhatsApp is a big growth driver. The company is leveraging AI to help advertisers automate their ad campaigns. Zuckerberg thinks it's possible that smart glasses with built-in AI assistants could be a ""killer app."" He also reiterated that Meta plans to roll out functionality including holograms and a sense of presence for its smart glasses in the future. Meta intends to incorporate artificial general intelligence (AGI) into its products as well. In the company's Q4 earnings call, Zuckerberg said, ""We're going to need our models to be able to reason, plan, code, remember, and many other cognitive capabilities in order to provide the best versions of the services we envision."" I won't be surprised if Meta's shares pull back somewhat over the next year like some of its Magnificent Seven peers have. But I fully expect this stock to be a magnificent winner for investors over the next decade and beyond. Before you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this: "
13,AMZN,"Two years after its historic win, a divided Amazon Labor Union lurches toward a leadership election",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/two-years-historic-win-divided-092613860.html,"Despite campaigns at several facilities in the past few years, the warehouse on Staten Island still is the only site in the U.S. where the retail giant's workers have voted in favor of union representation. Cracks emerged within the Amazon Labor Union ranks after it lost the votes at a second Staten Island warehouse and at one in upstate New York, spurring disagreements about the group's organizing strategy. “When the law allows management to drag out negotiations over years, and to use legal arguments to delay the progress that the workers have begun, it’s just an enormous hurdle,” said Benjamin Sachs, a labor law professor at Harvard University. In January, months after the splinter group called A.L.U. Democratic Reform Caucus filed its lawsuit, the union agreed to a court-brokered plan to allow rank-and-file members to vote on whether to hold an election for a slate of new officers. For five days that ended in early March, tables with ballots were set up outside the doors of the massive Staten Island warehouse. Smalls and other union leaders campaigned against the election, but the vote didn’t go their way. In court documents, Arthur Schwartz, an attorney who represents the dissident caucus, said that of the roughly 350 union members who voted, 60% favored having an officer election in June or July. The referendum, which had a low turnout rate, didn’t settle the legal back-and-forth and internal power plays. Last week, Jeanne Mirer, an attorney for the union, argued in a legal filing that the federal court in New York should reopen the court-brokered plan. She called it a “flawed” agreement that violated the union’s constitution. According to Mirer, the current ALU governing document requires members to pass an amendment or arrange a constitutional convention if they want to hold an officer election before a collective bargaining agreement is negotiated with Amazon. The current leaders also say the union has run out of money, which makes it challenging for them to conduct an election. “It doesn’t matter who’s in the chair,” Mirer said during an interview. “Anybody who is a leader has to get Amazon to the table, and working against each other isn’t going to do it.” Schwartz, the attorney for the dissidents, called the union’s legal claims “totally baseless,” arguing that the constitution at issue was imposed by Smalls – without a vote - in late 2022. He noted that the neutral monitor overseeing the implementation of the court-brokered plan - labor attorney Richard Levy - has scheduled candidate nomination meetings for May, which could allow an internal election to be held as early as June 11. Smalls, a former Amazon worker who co-founded the union during the coronavirus pandemic, did not respond to multiple requests for an interview. Last year, he told the New York Times that he traveled to help raise money for the union. He also told financial news website Business Insider in December that he would not seek reelection as ALU president. Valentin Nieves, who helps run the conveyor belts at the warehouse that unionized, said she felt frustrated during her time as an ALU officer by how much Smalls traveled, alleging that he missed weekly financial meetings for five months straight. She said she spoke with him about reducing his time away and encouraged him to periodically go to public bus stop near the warehouse, where many workers gathered after their shifts ended. But she said Smalls didn’t take her advice. “We need someone that is here. We need a contract and we need to organize the building,” Valentin Nieves said. “If we’re not able to do this, it’s going to have a domino effect, and a lot of Amazon workers are going to lose hope.” One Amazon worker on Staten Island, Keanu Rivera, 28, said he voted in favor of the union two years ago and sometimes reads the emails he receives from the labor group. Rivera said he used to see organizers talking to workers all the time before the representation vote two years ago. These days, he says there’s not much of that, a problem exacerbated by the Amazon policy restricting off-duty activity in work areas. “It’s all Amazon,” Rivera said. “Amazon got the money to stall them.” “We will continue to defend our position as the legal process continues,” Paradis said. Back in New York, organizers pushing for the internal election have their work cut out for them. They still need to secure a new mailing list for all the workers at the Staten Island warehouse, which has high turnover. Schwartz, the attorney for the dissidents, has asked the court to intervene so candidates whom the NLRB determined were illegally fired, such as Spence, can campaign in non-work areas of Amazon's property. “The hope of the caucus,"" he said, “is that we really use the election process to reenergize people in the plant.” "
14,AMZN,Best Stock to Buy Right Now: Shopify vs. Amazon,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/best-stock-buy-now-shopify-090300210.html,"As mentioned, the most apparent difference in these businesses is that only one of them, Amazon, is an e-retailer. Amazon pioneered e-commerce in the U.S. It started by selling books, but over time, evolved into a retailer that ""sells everything."" While it has become the second-largest retailer in the U.S., the company actually earns its income from other businesses. Amazon's primary source of operating income is Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud computing arm. Moreover, even in its retail segments, businesses such as digital advertising, subscriptions, and online seller services are much larger growth drivers than online sales. In contrast, Shopify is not an e-retailer. It developed a fast, highly customizable platform that enables merchants of all sizes to show and sell their products online. It has also ventured into ancillary services such as raising capital, processing payments, and managing inventory for items that sell both online and offline. Additionally, Amazon has existed longer than Shopify. It was founded in 1994, versus 2006 for Shopify. Amazon has capitalized on a longer existence and rapid growth to become a much larger company. As a result, Amazon has risen to a market cap of almost $1.9 trillion, approximately 19 times larger than Shopify's market cap of just under $100 billion. Despite its large size, Amazon continues to maintain a relatively rapid growth rate. This is mostly because of the smaller, high-margin businesses under its umbrella, which contrast with the low margins and slower growth rate of its massive online sales business. A smaller size worked in Shopify's favor, as its $7.1 billion in revenue increased 26% yearly. Nonetheless, its logistics businesses, which it sold last May, weighed on profitability. As a result, it earned just $132 million in net income in 2023, with its Q4 income of $657 million exceeding the yearly total. Shopify lost nearly $3.5 billion in 2022. Those struggles may explain why Amazon's stock rose faster than Shopify's over the last 12 months. Still, on a five-year timeline, Shopify far outperformed the e-commerce conglomerate. With that performance, Shopify is a comparatively more expensive stock. It sells at a pricey forward P/E ratio of 73. In contrast, Amazon, which rarely sells at a low multiple, trades at just 42 times forward earnings, a differential that could strengthen the case for Amazon amid the higher returns more recently. Ultimately, both stocks should beat the market as their technology continues to attract more business. Still, while risk-averse investors might prefer Amazon, investors with some appetite for risk should lean toward Shopify. Shopify has grown revenue at a faster pace over time, and the decision to sell the logistics business has again made it a profitable company. Moreover, even without a logistics arm, Shopify has an ecosystem that will help it attract more merchants and upsell additional services. Now that the company has again turned profitable, the faster revenue growth should translate into larger earnings increases, a factor that should drive the stock price higher at a more rapid pace. "
15,AMZN,Here Are My 3 Top Tech Stocks to Buy Right Now,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-top-tech-stocks-buy-224600585.html,"The U.S. stock market has been exceptionally volatile since 2020, mainly due to the lasting impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, increasing economic uncertainties, and geopolitical tensions. However, despite the tumultuous economic environment, many technology stocks have posted eye-popping returns. Increasing adoption of remote work, online shopping, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies has played a major role in driving technology stocks. With investors keen on capitalizing on the digital transformation trend, here are my three top technology picks that are well suited to deliver solid long-term returns in the coming years. Not surprisingly, the company's investments in ChatGPT developer OpenAI continue to be the talk of the town. Microsoft has successfully integrated OpenAI's technologies across its suite of products, rapidly acquiring new customers and significant productivity gains. Going beyond Azure, Microsoft's AI-powered assistant, CoPilot, is increasing efficiency and productivity for user of its Microsoft 365 cloud-native productivity platform and GitHub software development platform. CoPilot played a major role in driving Github revenue up over 40% year over year in the second quarter. While the adoption of AI technologies has fast-tracked Microsoft's growth strategy, the company's broad geographic presence and diversified product portfolio are also additional reasons to like the stock. The company also boasts a solid balance sheet, with $81 billion in cash and $58.7 billion in free cash flow. Looking at the long-term potential of Microsoft's AI-powered businesses and solid financial position, the stock seems like a smart buy now. Amazon is ready to rake in profits from its world-leading e-commerce business. The company's focus on delivery speeds is translating into higher purchase frequency by Prime members. An increasing percentage of third-party sellers is also helping strengthen the company's e-commerce business. Finally, Amazon is monetizing its online platform beyond product sales by offering targeted and relevant advertising to sellers and customers. As the leader in multiple high-growth markets, there seems to be plenty of growth yet to come for Amazon. The Confluent Cloud cloud-based platform has emerged as a major growth catalyst and is being increasingly adopted by digital-native customers, even in a difficult macroeconomic environment. Confluent Cloud saw its revenue reach $100 million for the first time in the fourth quarter, up 46% on a year-over-year basis. Confluent's recent financial performance underlines the resilience of its business model. After seeing its shares crash due to weak guidance given in the third quarter, the company made a solid comeback with stellar results in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. Revenue and earnings surpassed consensus estimates. Furthermore, the company also achieved its first positive non-GAAP (adjusted) operating margin of 5.3% in the fourth quarter, up 27 percentage points on a year-over-year basis. While free cash flow was negative in 2023, Confluent expects it to break even in 2024. Plus, the company is currently focusing on a target addressable market of over $60 billion. With an annual revenue run rate of just $777 million, there is still much runway left for the company. "

19,AMZN,Love Amazon? This Alternative Stock Might Have Higher Upside.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/love-amazon-alternative-stock-might-194600655.html,"Even though Sea stock is down 85% from its all-time high, I think it's surprisingly a better buy than Amazon stock today. Here's why. Over the last decade, Amazon's operating profits have largely soared because of the success of its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud-computing services -- AWS supplied 67% of the company's operating income in 2023. But operating profits pulled back in recent years as it invested heavily in logistics to accommodate skyrocketing e-commerce demand. Amazon's operating profits are now normalizing as investments wind down. Management expects to earn $8 billion to $12 billion in the upcoming first quarter alone. Therefore, I wouldn't be surprised if Amazon stock has more upside. Compared to Sea stock, Amazon might be a safer bet for making money. That said, Sea stock could have more upside if things go right. First, it's important to note that Sea stock is cheaper than Amazon stock by the price-to-sales (P/S) metric. To value a stock such as Sea at just 2 times sales suggests that investors don't believe the company can grow -- at least not profitably. But I think the company's recent results disprove both opinions. Consider the chart below that breaks down the financial results for all three of Sea's business segments. Officially, the company calls these segments e-commerce, digital entertainment, and digital financial services. Note that the profit column refers to adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). Segment Revenue growth Profit E-commerce 24% ($214) million Digital entertainment (44)% $921 million Digital financial services 44% $550 million Data source: Sea's press release. Chart by author. One of Sea's segments has declining revenue, and another has an adjusted EBITDA loss. But as a whole, Sea's revenue was up in 2023, and it was a profitable company. Therefore, the company can grow profitably because it's doing it right now. Therefore, the question isn't whether this company can grow profitably; the real question is whether it can capture a large opportunity. It's hard to overstate the opportunities for Sea. The company does business in growing economies that are digitizing at a fast pace, such as Indonesia, Brazil, India, and more. And with these markets comes the potential for growth. Take Sea's focus on Brazilian e-commerce, for example. In 2020, the company entered the market. In February, just four short years later, it had already opened its 10th distribution center in the country. These Brazilian distribution centers represent significant investment on Sea's part. But as mentioned, it's a big opportunity. Research group Mordor Intelligence estimates that Brazilian e-commerce is a $53 billion market today. But it predicts it will grow at an astonishing 19% compound annual growth rate through 2029. Other research groups similarly predict double-digit growth. And Sea is building the infrastructure to capitalize. With only $13 billion in trailing 12-month revenue, Sea has ample room for upside given the size of its markets, growth in those markets, and the strong demand for the products and services that it and its competitors offer. With closer to $600 billion in trailing 12-month revenue, I'd say the upside potential for Amazon is much lower at this point, which is why Sea is a promising company for investors to consider buying today. Before you buy stock in Sea Limited, consider this: "
20,AMZN,Billionaire Ken Griffin Has More Than Tripled His Investment in This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock. Should You Buy It Too?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/billionaire-ken-griffin-more-tripled-175500316.html,"Ken Griffin founded Citadel in 1990. It's now the most successful hedge fund ever. Through Citadel, Griffin built a personal fortune of $37 billion. The billionaire hedge fund manager has a long history with Amazon. He first initiated a position in the stock in the second quarter of 2013. Griffin sold almost 97% of those shares in the next quarter. However, he later built up Citadel's stake in Amazon again. In the fourth quarter of 2016, though, Citadel fully exited its position in the stock. Griffin didn't sit on the sidelines for long. In the first quarter of 2017, he again bought shares of Amazon, then added to Citadel's position throughout the rest of the year. Amazon has been a big winner for Griffin and Citadel. Its shares jumped by more than 200% during the first period when it was in the hedge fund's portfolio. The stock is up by more than 300% since the end of 2017's first quarter. However, I suspect AI was near the front of Griffin's mind when he backed up the truck and loaded up on more Amazon stock in 2023 Q4. In particular, the generative AI boom should provide a huge long-term tailwind for Amazon Web Services (AWS). AI remains key to Amazon's e-commerce business as well. Earlier this year, it introduced Rufus, an AI shopping assistant that can converse with customers and help them find the best products to meet their needs. No one should buy any stock just because Griffin or some other famous investor is buying it. Your risk tolerance and investing objectives could be (and probably are) quite different than those of a billionaire hedge fund manager. That said, I think Amazon would be a great stock to buy right now for many investors -- and not just because of its AI opportunities. Amazon's profitability continues to increase. The company has found a fantastic, fast-growing revenue source with advertising. Even without the lure of AI, customers will continue to move more of their apps and data to the cloud. Amazon should make money for plenty of investors over the next several years, including those of us who are far from being billionaires. Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this: "

22,AMZN,4 Signs You're Not Taking Advantage of Your Amazon Prime Membership,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-signs-youre-not-taking-150016004.html,"The $139 fee I pay each year for Amazon Prime is a no-brainer for my household. My Prime membership saves me countless trips to the store each year, so that alone is worth the fee. Plus, my family tends to use Amazon's free content to some degree. That's not the main reason I pay for a membership, but it's a nice bonus. Clearly, I'm a firm believer that an Amazon Prime membership can be worth the money. But it's really only worth it if you're making good use of your membership. Here are a few signs that may not be the case. The cost to ship items as a non-Prime member can vary depending on their size and weight. But all told, if you're placing fewer than, say, eight or nine orders per year and aren't really using the non-shipping benefits offered by Prime, then you may want to reconsider keeping or renewing your membership. To be clear, you shouldn't buy extra things on Amazon for the purpose of using your membership. Rather, it's that if you're not ordering from the site often, it may be that you don't need Prime, or that you're running to your local big-box store in lieu of placing a Prime order too often. So all told, you may want to revisit your shopping habits across the board. The benefit of Amazon Prime is scoring free shipping on orders of any size. Want a $4 box of markers? Amazon will ship it and you won't have to pay (other than the $4, of course). But if you mostly place orders of $35 or more on Amazon, then you may not need Prime. The reason? Orders of that size ship for free. (Note that in some ZIP codes, you may still be able to get free shipping at $25.) And while you won't get two-day shipping, Amazon is known for its ability to ship items efficiently. Amazon tends to have a pretty generous return policy. But still, what might happen is you place an order, your credit card gets charged, and by the time you return an unwanted item, you're stuck paying your credit card bill in full while you wait to be refunded. If you're a Prime member, you can easily avoid this scenario with apparel and footwear. That's because Prime members can take advantage of the Try Before You Buy program. You order items and get a seven-day try-on period once they arrive. If you don't want to keep the items, you send them back and your credit card isn't charged. You may be inclined to run to the store when you need last-minute items in a pinch. But if you're a Prime member, you may be able to spare yourself those trips. Certain Prime items are available for same-day shipping. This will of course depend on your location and the items you're looking to purchase. But before you upend your day with a last-minute errand the next time a situation like this arises, spend 60 seconds on Amazon to see if the things you need can be shipped to your home same-day. Many people would argue that paying the $139 annual fee for Amazon Prime is reasonable. Heck, I'm fine with paying it because I get a lot of value out of my membership. But if you're going to spend the money, you might as well get the most out of Prime yourself. And if you realize you can do without Prime, you might as well cancel your membership and use that money for other things -- or put it in the bank, where it can serve you equally well. "
23,AMZN,Is Amazon Stock a Buy Now?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-stock-buy-now-123000822.html,"The company is on a promising growth path and seems nowhere near to hitting its ceiling as it continues to profit from the tailwinds of artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing. So, here's why Amazon's stock is a screaming buy right now. However, the company has made an impressive recovery, proving its reliability and resilience. In fiscal 2023, Amazon's revenue rose 12% year over year to $575 billion, while operating income tripled to $37 billion. Amazon's performance over the last year highlights the importance of investing with a long-term mindset. Investors who sold the company's stock in 2022 will not have benefited from its significant growth since then. However, Amazon's biggest growth catalyst is easily its cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS). In the fourth quarter of 2023, revenue from the platform rose 13% year over year to $24 billion. Meanwhile, AWS was responsible for 54% of the company's operating income, despite earning the lowest portion of revenue among its three segments. AWS gives Amazon a lucrative role in AI, a market projected to develop at a CAGR of 37% until at least 2030. As the world's biggest cloud service provider, AWS has the potential to leverage its massive cloud data centers and steer the generative AI market. So, it's unsurprising that the cloud company is investing heavily in the budding sector. In 2023, AWS responded to increased demand for AI services by introducing a variety of new tools. The platform launched Bedrock, a program that helps customers build generative AI applications. It also unveiled CodeWhisperer, capable of generating code for developers, and HealthScribe, a tool that can transcribe patient-to-physician conversations. Meanwhile, Amazon is even using AI to boost its retail site and announced an AI shopping assistant dubbed Rufus ahead of its latest earnings release. The tech giant is on a promising growth path, and earnings-per-share estimates seem to support its significant potential. The chart above indicates that Amazon's earnings could achieve nearly $7 per share by fiscal 2026. When multiplying that by its forward price-to-earnings ratio of 44, you get a stock price of $308. This projection would see Amazon's stock rise 66% from its current value over the next two fiscal years. The company's shares are a screaming buy right now and worth considering before its share price surges. Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this: "
24,AMZN,"""Big Short"" Investor Michael Burry Has 10% of His Portfolio in 2 ""Magnificent Seven"" AI Stocks",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-short-investor-michael-burry-121000441.html,"So why did Burry open positions in Amazon and Alphabet? Had Amazon been earning a 7.5% profit margin for the entire year on its total revenue of $575 billion, it would have generated $43 billion in profits in 2023. Against its current market cap of $1.9 trillion, that would have given it a P/E of 44. But even this doesn't tell the full story. Amazon's profit margins should continue to move higher in 2024, for multiple reasons. First, its high-margin cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services (AWS), continues to shine. Second, it is seeing strong growth from higher-margin e-commerce services such as third-party selling management and advertising. Advertising revenues, for reference, grew by 26% year over year last quarter. If Amazon's profit margin reaches 10% in 2024 and its revenue grows by 10% to $630 billion, it will generate $63 billion in earnings this year. That would give it a P/E of 30, or right around the S&P 500's average. Burry likely anticipates that profit inflection happening as well, which would explain why he is buying shares for Scion Asset Management's portfolio. Burry's other Magnificent Seven bet, Alphabet, is not optically expensive, but it faced some major negative narratives throughout 2023. At the beginning of 2023, the tech giant traded at a P/E ratio below 15, likely due to investor fears that it was losing the race in AI to upstarts such as OpenAI. Today, it trades at a P/E of 27, which is still slightly below the S&P 500 average, even though the stock is up 77% year to date. Burry and other investors likely expect Alphabet to maintain its overwhelming share of the search market, which gives it a lucrative digital advertising business. Google Search's market share has remained remarkably steady despite all these new AI competitors, at over 90% according to the latest estimates. In the fourth quarter of 2023, Google Search revenue grew 12.7% year over year to $48 billion. Alphabet also has promising businesses in YouTube and Google Cloud. YouTube is the dominant player in video streaming worldwide, generating $9.2 billion in advertising revenue last quarter and hitting 100 million premium subscribers. Google Cloud does right around the same in quarterly revenue and is growing sales by 25% year over year. If Alphabet maintains its lead in Google Search and keeps growing YouTube and Google Cloud, the stock will likely do well over the long term. Looking through the portfolio holdings of famous investors can be insightful. But nobody should be out there blindly buying up every company in Burry's portfolio. First off, we outsiders can't know what Burry's actual theses are on these two stocks. His reasons for holding them may differ from your own, and that could create some discomfort for you if the stocks start falling. Second, the investing public only finds out about hedge funds' moves through their 13-F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These filings are due a month and a half after the end of the quarter they cover, and the most recent ones describe where their portfolios stood at the end of 2023. As such, we can have no idea if Burry has bought or sold Amazon and Alphabet shares in 2024, or if he even has any exposure to the stocks right now. This informational time lag makes trying to copy the moves of famous investors a dangerous idea. Learn from the investing greats, but don't copy them. It's better to build your portfolio with stocks you believe in, not stocks you believe that others believe in. Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this: "
25,AMZN,1 Top Buffett Stock to Buy and Hold for the Long Haul,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-top-buffett-stock-buy-113700730.html,"The king of e-commerce in the coronavirus lockdown era lost a step when the inflation crisis started. Amazon's pandemic-inflated sales growth slowed down to a crawl in 2022. At the bottom of that downturn, the company saw $30 billion of negative free cash flow in a single year. Wall Street's reaction was brutal. At the start of 2023, Amazon's stock had fallen 56% from its all-time peak. I hope you were buying Amazon shares a year ago. As it turns out, the company was busy setting itself up for renewed growth in a healthier economy. Moreover, OpenAI had just kick-started the artificial intelligence (AI) frenzy that's expected to power the tech sector for the foreseeable future, with Amazon Web Services (AWS) positioned as a leading platform provider. Of course, it wasn't obvious in 2022 that generative AI tools were about to turn the tech sector upside down. The inflation-fighting moves seemed more painful than effective at the time. And Amazon was still burning a ton of cash, adjusting to a weaker retail business and an overly enthusiastic infrastructure expansion during the coronavirus pandemic. Still, Amazon always seems to have the right answer for any challenge. Today, its annual free cash flow stands at an all-time high of $32 billion, and year-over-year sales growth has returned to double-digit percentages. Amazon's stock is also sniffing around record levels again after a two-year retreat. Shares aren't cheap, trading at 64 times trailing earnings and 59 times free cash flow, but I wish I had a dollar for every time people called Amazon ""overvalued"" in its market-stomping three-decade history. Already one of the world's largest and most valuable businesses, Amazon still has a lot of room to continue growing. The AI boom is one active catalyst, along with a vast amount of untapped international opportunity and the fact that old-school brick-and-mortar stores still control 85% of retail activity even in the U.S. market. Amazon's e-commerce muscle can flex much further. You shouldn't put all your nest eggs in the Amazon basket, but the stock belongs in any diversified investment portfolio with an eye toward above-average growth prospects. Warren Buffett wishes he had bought Amazon shares earlier, but it's not too late to jump aboard this long-term growth train. Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this: "

27,AMZN,Biden’s manufacturing industry is expanding. That could be bad for inflation,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/biden-manufacturing-industry-expanding-could-110026813.html,"ISM’s latest purchasing managers index for the US manufacturing sector, a monthly survey that gauges economic activity, rose more than expected in March to a reading of 50.3, the first time the index has registered above 50 since September 2022. A reading above 50 indicates expansion, while anything below reflects contraction. “In the interim, I think it is smart for the Fed to take our time,” Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin said Thursday at an event in Richmond, Virginia. “No one wants inflation to reemerge. And, given a strong labor market, we have time for the clouds to clear before beginning the process of toggling rates down.” San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly was asked Tuesday to directly weigh in on ISM’s latest manufacturing data during a moderated discussion in Las Vegas. She said it didn’t change her overall assessment of the US economy. “That is just one data point in the sea of data that we collect,” Daly said. “You want to step back and say ‘what’s been happening?’ and there I see that the economy continues to remain very solid. No matter where you look, you see strength.” ISM’s manufacturing data added to evidence that the economy remains robust, keeping the Fed on hold. “This report will make the Fed’s job a little trickier, and it will undoubtedly be happy the market is still not anticipating rate changes until June or July, giving it that much more time to continue to watch the data roll in,” Richard de Chazal, macro analyst at William Blair Equity Research, said in a note released Monday. The economy picking up further strength would spook Wall Street because of what it means for interest rates — and some manufacturers say they’re optimistic about the future. “Business activity is up. Many manufacturers are anticipating better business in the second quarter and much better in the third quarter. They are reporting that second-quarter bookings are just starting to ramp up,” a wood products manufacturer told ISM in the survey. Another manufacturer said that they’re “expecting to see orders and production pick up for the second quarter.” “Suppliers are working with us to help drive costs down, which will help improve the margin for the rest of the year and deliver growth in 2025,” they said. Customers just haven’t bought into cashier-less technology, especially in grocery stores where they purchase larger quantities and face extra tasks such as weighing produce. Amazon said the checkout technology may be more seamless in smaller stores. In a statement, Amazon said it will continue using the Just Walk Out technology in Amazon Go stores, at smaller format Fresh stores in the UK, and third-party locations such as certain sports stadiums and college campuses. Amazon had used roughly 1,000 humans in India, according to some news reports, to help monitor accurate checkouts. "
28,AMZN,"2 Trillion-Dollar ""Magnificent Seven"" Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist in April (Hint: Neither of Them Is Nvidia)",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-trillion-dollar-magnificent-seven-102900001.html,"Some members of the group are faltering in 2024, with Tesla stock sinking 33% and Apple down by 12%. By comparison, the S&P 500 is up 9% this year and is trading near an all-time high. But even though some of the Magnificent Seven stocks are trailing the market right now, others like Microsoft and Amazon continue to outperform. Here's why those two businesses are a buy this month, even though they are trading near their best-ever levels. Microsoft Azure is the world's second-largest provider of cloud services, and more than 53,000 business customers are paying to use large language models (LLMs) -- including OpenAI's GPT-4 -- to build their own AI applications on that platform. But Microsoft's consumer-facing products might be an even more lucrative opportunity over the long term. The company developed a virtual assistant called Copilot, which is similar to ChatGPT except it runs on a blend of OpenAI's GPT-4 and Microsoft's own in-house models. It has embedded Copilot into the Windows operating system, 365 document suite, Bing search engine, and Edge internet browser. Around 1.4 billion active devices worldwide are using Windows 10 and 11 alone (that includes commercial users). Even if only a fraction of them regularly engage with Copilot, it would be one of the most widely adopted AI assistants in the world. Considering it can answer complex questions and even generate images, Copilot has the potential to pull traffic away from traditional search engines like Google, creating an enormous financial opportunity for Microsoft through advertising. Over 1 billion people also use Microsoft 365 applications like Word, Excel, and PowerPoint (including 400 million corporate seats), and Microsoft now offers a Copilot add-on for $30 per user monthly. AI is the ultimate productivity tool, and it's the perfect companion for applications like Word because it can quickly draft content to save the user significant amounts of time. If just 100 million 365 users adopt Copilot, it could add $3 billion to Microsoft's revenue every single month. That would translate into a 17% increase on the company's $211 billion in fiscal 2023 revenue. The potential of Microsoft's large installed base of software products that could be used as vessels to monetize AI, whether via advertising or paid subscriptions, is a key reason Microsoft is now the world's biggest company, with a $3.1 trillion valuation. As long as investors can hold on for at least the next few years, there is no time like the present to buy Microsoft stock. Amazon is the world's largest e-commerce company, and it still generates more revenue from online sales than any of its other business segments, despite expanding into cloud computing, digital advertising, streaming, and more. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the largest cloud platform in the world by revenue, and it offers hundreds of digital solutions to help its business customers store data, operate their online sales channels, and develop software. But AWS is also home to many of Amazon's AI initiatives, and it wants to dominate three of the technology's core layers: hardware, LLMs, and applications. Amazon also develops LLMs under its Titan program. Developers can access them on AWS and use them as the foundation for their AI applications. It saves a substantial amount of resources, because building an LLM requires mountains of data, time, and money. Beyond Titan, AWS also offers large language models from leading AI start-ups like Anthropic, in which Amazon recently invested $4 billion. The final layer is the finished application. AWS offers products like CodeWhisperer, which helps developers accelerate their software programming. AWS also launched a virtual assistant called Q recently, which is perfect for businesses looking for a ready-made chatbot as opposed to building their own. Q can be tailored to meet specific needs and trained on the data of any organization to be as helpful as possible. Amazon generated $574 billion in total revenue last year, which is more than any of the other Magnificent Seven companies. However, despite its stock rising 20% in 2024 already and trading near an all-time high, it's still the cheapest of the Magnificent Seven as measured by the price-to-sales ratio. That spells opportunity for investors. "
29,AMZN,"Forget Nvidia: Here Are 3 ""Magnificent Seven"" Stocks Wall Street Thinks Will Soar More",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/forget-nvidia-3-magnificent-seven-094500601.html,"It might be surprising that Wall Street is so optimistic about Apple. The tech giant's sales growth has slowed considerably, and its valuation is relatively high, with shares trading at a forward earnings multiple of nearly 26. Wall Street thinks Amazon can move even higher. The consensus price target for the stock is roughly 6.5% above the current share price. Forty-three of the 47 analysts surveyed by LSEG in April rate Amazon as a buy or a strong buy. Generative AI continues to provide a major tailwind for Amazon Web Services (AWS), as customers like to run apps where their data is. Since AWS commands the leading market share among cloud platforms, it's where many organizations are training and deploying their generative AI apps. Amazon's advertising business is also enjoying strong momentum. The company is using AI to boost the relevancy of the ads displayed to customers. It has also expanded advertising on Prime Video. The average analyst's 12-month price target is nearly 6% higher than the current price. Wall Street is overwhelmingly bullish about the tech stock, with 38 of the 43 analysts surveyed by LSEG in April rating Alphabet as a buy or a strong buy. Alphabet's Google unit has experienced a couple of embarrassments with its generative AI apps -- first, with Bard last year, and more recently, with Gemini earlier this year. However, these missteps don't seem to have concerned analysts very much. They're more focused on the growth opportunities for Google Cloud and Google's continued dominance in search. Some also have great long-term expectations for Alphabet's Waymo self-driving car business. You can't depend on Wall Street's price targets. Even highly paid analysts focused on scrutinizing companies' operations can't predict the future with a high level of accuracy. However, I suspect Wall Street could be right about Apple, Amazon, and Alphabet. They could be right about Nvidia, too. Nvidia could continue to soar higher, but competition is increasing. Any hiccup could cause the stock to tumble. I think Apple's shares could jump on good news at the upcoming developer conference. Amazon and Alphabet should deliver solid growth in the next few quarters, largely due to the generative AI tailwinds. Wall Street isn't always right.

33,AMZN,"Could Investing $10,000 in Amazon Make You a Millionaire?",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/could-investing-10-000-amazon-071500793.html,"If the company continues to execute well, it could easily help to mint more wealth in the future, just like it has in the past. But hit the pause button before you buy it. If you had invested $10,000 in Amazon stock on Jan. 1, 2000 (just before the dot-com crash), your investment would be worth over $470,000 today. To put a number on that last point, Amazon ended 2023 with roughly $73.4 billion in cash and nearly $13.4 billion in marketable securities. Long-term debt only amounted to $58.3 billion, meaning it had a net cash position of about $28.5 billion. That's a lot of cash! So, not only has Amazon's growth helped to make a lot of investors rich, but there's also a good reason to think that it could keep making investors rich in the future as well, if it invests as wisely in the future as it has in the past. There's just one small problem. Amazon returned 4,630% between Jan. 1, 2000, and March 31, 2023. That's a truly incredible number. But would you have been able to own just one stock? The benefit of hindsight would clearly say you should have done just that. But sticking it out in real-time would have been much harder than you think. Remember: Jan. 1, 2000, was the height of the dot-com craze that lifted stocks like Amazon to lofty levels. Following the dot-com bust, Amazon lost over 80% of its value. That was much worse than the S&P 500 index's loss at the time. It took years for the stock to recover. And once it did, the shares promptly lost around 50% of their value during the Great Recession. Over the last couple of years, it lost nearly that much again. And 20% drawdowns are, frankly, pretty common for Amazon. The peaks and valleys in Amazon's stock price are far greater than those of the S&P 500 index over time. Unless you have actually lived through volatility like this, it is hard to explain the fortitude required to hold on to a stock while it is falling so hard and fast. That's particularly true when the decline is way in excess of that of the broader market. So, could Amazon help you become a millionaire? Sure, but you probably shouldn't bet everything you have on just one stock. The risk of having such a concentrated portfolio is huge, and sticking to the one-stock approach will likely be an emotional roller coaster. A lot of investors would probably end up selling out of fear at the worst possible time. A far better option would be to build a diversified portfolio that includes Amazon or to pair Amazon with a broad-based index ETF. The truth of the matter is that investing itself isn't a particularly difficult task. As Wall Street icon Warren Buffett likes to say, anyone with average intelligence can do it. But mastering your emotions during the inevitable bull and bear markets? That takes a huge amount of effort, and most people fail to do it (all of the time, anyway). Buying a single stock, even one with a huge history of success behind it like Amazon, can, indeed, put you on your way to millionaire status. However, it just isn't that easy when you actually examine what it means to own just one stock. Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this: "
34,AMZN,Best Stock to Buy Right Now: Amazon vs. Disney,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/best-stock-buy-now-amazon-140000439.html,"Most investors want a few proven winners in their portfolios, even if they're focused on growth stocks. The two aren't mutually exclusive. Some established industry leaders still have incredible growth prospects, and they come with the added benefit of reliability. It's easy to see why Amazon is an amazing stock to own, but the picture becomes even clearer once you dig into the details. One of Amazon's newer ventures is its advertising business, which accounts for less than 9% of sales but provides a strong growth engine, increasing 27% year over year in the fourth quarter. Like AWS, it's a lean, service-oriented business with high margins, and it's contributing to Amazon's growing operating income. Amazon has a robust streaming business that sits right along the top networks, and it's also making strides in healthcare, where it's just getting its feet wet and learning about the business. Stay tuned for Amazon to launch new healthcare services as it sets out to transform the industry. This is only some of what's happening at Amazon today, and there's a lot to look forward to as Amazon continues its journey. Disney also has multiple parts, but they center around the entertainment industry. Depending on who you ask, Disney is best known for its unparalleled theme parks or industry-dominating films and franchises, but content distribution on linear networks and now streaming are also a big part of its model. Disney operates 12 global theme parks plus other experiences such as cruises and resorts. Demand is booming for its popular destination parks, and Disney has raised prices several times over the past few years. Parks revenue increased 7% year over year in the 2024 fiscal first quarter (ended Dec. 30), and Disney is investing $60 billion in improving and expanding parks to create a broader range of physical experiences for guests. Management recently restructured, and all of its media and networks are now reported under a segment called ""entertainment."" This segment reported a 7% sales decline in the first quarter, mostly due to cord-cutting and pressure in its ad-based networks. But it's making progress in turning Disney+ profitable, and streaming operating loss contracted from $984 million last year to $138 million this year in the first quarter. That's getting close to positive, and CEO Bob Iger reiterated that streaming is expected to become profitable by the end of the year. Disney has an unbeatable film and content creation system that populates its streaming efforts and consistently accounts for more top box office hits than its competition. Three of the top 10 movies in ticket sales in 2023 were Disney films, and Disney typically releases several sequels or franchise-based films in a given year in addition to developing new characters and franchises. This fuels the cycle of its magic-creation and generates loyalty, fans, sales, and opportunity. There's a lot in store for Disney shareholders in 2024 and beyond, and this could be the year that Disney stock finally reaches an all-time high. Disney stock is up 32% this year, and Amazon stock is up 20%. Disney started off the year with more to catch up on than Amazon, which has been soaring over the past year while Disney was still down in the dumps. Both of these stocks should continue to reward shareholders this year and in the future. Disney stock is likely to explode when streaming hits profitability and as its business continues to bounce back, but Amazon still has more overall tailwinds. Disney also comes with some added volatility as it needs to choose a CEO to take over for Bob Iger over the next two years. So for today's verdict, I'm going to go with Amazon as the better buy. Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this: "
35,AMZN,"Just Announced: Amazon to Replace ""Just Walk Out"" Technology in Amazon Fresh Stores. 3 Things Investors Should Know About the Change",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/just-announced-amazon-replace-just-130000970.html,"When I first heard the news, I immediately assumed that Amazon's Just Walk Out technology must not work. But that's not the case, as I'll explain more in a moment. This is good news for entities that have already partnered with Amazon in this system. For example, the company announced ""Badge Pay"" in January, which is based on Just Walk Out, allowing hospital workers to simply grab food and go by scanning their badges. Hospitals that have already signed up for this, such as St. Joseph's/Candler in Savannah, should still be able to use it. For more proof that it works, Amazon intends to keep the technology at its Amazon Go chain as well as in its Amazon Fresh stores in the United Kingdom. Amazon is reportedly only removing Just Walk Out from its Amazon Fresh chain. According to an Amazon spokesperson, consumers didn't like shopping without knowing the bill in real time. This was actually a problem that manifested at launch. In a 2020 article, an interviewed shopper said that Just Walk Out ""makes it easy to spend more money than you would pulling out your card and seeing the total."" Therefore, Amazon is turning to smart shopping carts from here. Shoppers will still be able to skip past cashiers. But the smart carts will display the up-to-date bill as they put items into it, addressing a key consumer complaint. Far more important for Amazon investors today are things such as digital advertising. In 2023, the company generated an impressive $47 billion in ad revenue, which was growing at a 26% rate in the fourth quarter. Indeed, revenue growth for advertising is accelerating and still has room to grow. Even more important for Amazon investors is cloud computing platform Amazon Web Services (AWS). The company has an astounding $156 billion in contracted performance obligations mostly related to AWS and these contracts cover four years on average. This is clearly an important business segment given its size. But AWS is also important because it supplies about two-thirds of total operating income. Those expectantly waiting for Amazon to revolutionize the retail checkout experience may have to be patient; the company is still tinkering to see what works best. There are still plenty of ways this could play out. But it's possible Amazon could find something that works and enjoys mass adoption in time. That said, Just Walk Out technology is a minor detail for Amazon's massive business and shareholders have more important things to focus on. But the good news is that the more important areas of the business are enjoying robust growth, which bodes well for Amazon stock in 2024 and beyond. Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this: "

37,AMZN,Can a New CEO Fix Boeing?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ceo-fix-boeing-121500968.html,"In this podcast, Motley Fool host Dylan Lewis and analysts Emily Flippen and Jason Moser discuss: Before you buy stock in Boeing, consider this: It's the Motley Fool Money radio show. I'm Dylan Lewis. Joining me in the studio Motley Fool Senior Analysts Emily Flippen and Jason Moser, Fools great to have you both here. Boeing has now easily classified itself, but it's worth remembering part the reason why I'm letting Calhoun off easy here is because Calhoun was brought into the role in 2019 after Boeing had it's 737 MAX incidents when he had those couple of crashes and there's like OK, we need to change the culture. We need to have a more emphasis on safety and let's bring in this new CEO and obviously Calhoun was not able to change whatever the cultural issues that I think are struggling with this business right now, the emphasis on quality and control, that's what the business is lacking. So they need to bring in somebody who has a bit more experience and changing the culture of a corporation because that's the problem. This is something that's been festering with this company for awhile, and culture is funny when things are going really well, culture is going really, you can't really nail down what it is, but everything is going well, so it doesn't really matter. When things start going wrong, then you can start looking to say, well, maybe there's some cultural issues that we need to resolve here. I think this is something that goes well before I'll just reiterate one additional thing I like because he talked a lot about culture, that's a lot of it. But they're also talking about acquiring one of their third-party suppliers and I think that could be interesting as well because he talked about emphasis on quality control when you own the entire supply chain, when you own it from top to bottom, that can be a little bit easier to make sure things are done right. So they have really great technology. I think they know they have great technology though that's part of the reason why these are still rumors of this acquisition because talks presumably fell through over the course of the past year. I think Shockwave is probably being picky about pricier. They have something good, they know it and they don't want to sell out for anything less than they're worth. They spent a good amount of time in their investor conference call talking to investors explaining how they think this could accelerate their sales growth and that's exactly what this is for anybody who's wondering, this is Home Depot saying there's an area of the pro market that we're just not able to tap right now and by acquiring this large, I don't want to necessarily call it a competitor because they slightly different business models, but also used the word competitor for this purposes . Acquiring this large competitor really will position us better to bring pros who are not currently in our ecosystem to our ecosystem. Picking up that percentage of sales that people are making, not-at-home, Home Depot, they go and they get 60% of what they need for their projects at Home Depot and then they go somewhere else. They're trying to get that someone's else business. I do think it's interesting. I do worry that regulators, given how, hence I think relationships between large corporations and regulators have been in the United States recently that there's likely to be some interest in this deal. I don't think it's as shoo-in as maybe the Home Depot management team believes it is, but it should be accretive for the company moving forward, even though it will likely lowered their margin profile. I think when you look at Home Depot for the financials perspective in regard to this deal. It's obviously a very big one to make happen. They don't have unlimited cash on the balance sheet. So this is something where they're going to be adding debt to the balance sheet. On top of that, they're also going to build out another four massive distribution centers in order to basically shorten that distance between the customer and the supplier and so I think it makes sense, it requires taking that longer-term view. Again, I think in regard to the debt that they take on to do this it's OK, it's a reliable business. The debt they have on the balance sheet at this point is staggered out very nicely over long periods of time. When you consider the importance of the housing market to our economy, we know home improvements not going anywhere. So this is business, not necessarily Home Depot's miss, but the business itself. This is business that's as reliable as the sun coming up. If Home Depot doesn't do it Lowe's is going to do it. So Home Depot's trying to beat him to the punch. They have all said the same thing, there will be some disruptions. But it's not something that really is going to impact our business too terribly much in the near term. It's worth saying, the American Trucking Association estimates of 4,900 trucks per day carrying an annual average of $28 billion worth of goods is going to have to be rerouted. There are economic implications here. But I don't think it's going to be something that we feel too terribly much, at least in the near term. Now a lot of this depends on how this problem is ultimately able to be solved, and Baltimore being the number one automobile port in the US as well, we're going to see a lot of that go to other parts of the country. I think the Port of Virginia being one of them. Not that we should. But one of the things that I think is worth keeping an eye on are those automobile manufacturers. Because the Port of Baltimore did have a fair number of trained staff for roll-on, roll-off, car import, and export. Not every harbor, apparently, as I've learned and that's armchair experting, again, is suited to take these types of vehicles. They'll have to find a new port with the level of trained staff that they have there in Baltimore and that could be challenging in the interim. Constant currency, they saw sales up 2%. They did see gross profit margin expansion, 140 basis points there as they are able to maintain some pricing. They do a very good job of bringing all of that down to the bottom line. This is a company that benefits from those economies of scale. They made a conscious decision in 2023 to discontinue a few low-margin businesses. That has played out a little bit in the near term there. But this is a business, I think that it was trading at a lower multiple than it deserves to. I'm not surprised to see the market react positively. Then most importantly, I think our marketing approach, the engine that we have that's really focused on engaging and entertaining them. We do things well outside of traditional beauty norms. We don't do much, I'd call it, broad scale based advertising. We do a lot of things on social. We do a lot of things on a number of different platforms and we try to find ways that are native and speak to them. We were one of the pioneers on TikTok from a beauty brand standpoint. When we first approached TikTok, I remember our CMO, Kory Marchisotto, came to me and said, ""Hey, we gotta be on TikTok because that's where Gen Z is."" My response was, ""Well, if that's where Gen Z is, we definitely should be on TikTok. Now, what's TikTok?"" This is five years ago, but when we approach a platform, we didn't approach it from an advertising standpoint, we tried to figure out what was Gen Z doing on TikTok. We saw a lot of self-expression, which speaks well to our overall mission, and a lot of music, a lot of dancing. We approached the platform with humility and we basically said, ""Let's do something that makes sense for Gen Z."" We commissioned our own song, our eyes, lips, face hashtag challenge was born and we have, I think that first challenge, 4 billion views. We kept going, we kept getting more creative on the platform where we created a rock brand with the Simon Fuller, the co-founder of American Idol. The challenge on that one was near 15 billion views. We find ways that really engage and entertain that community, and we continue to do that not only on TikTok, but we have our own channel on Twitch. Covergirl, close to 80 or 60. We have a long way to go and part of our strategy is certainly take that strength we have among Gen Z, but also bring other consumers into the franchise. So as you mentioned, we've been growing our audience among millennials, Gen X, Latinx and we feel the strategy we're using is attracting more consumers, but beyond what we're doing, what we're also finding is a different phenomenon going on where maybe historically a lot of the legacy brands, the mom would teach the kid all about makeup and go down generations, what we're now finding is sometimes mothers just sitting there going on like why is my teenager dragging me to Target so many times to go get this e.l.f. Then the moms are trying e.l.f and being like, ""My God, I can't believe this is so good at this price, why am I spending $50 on foundation when I can get what I can get one of the e.l.f ones for a fraction of that price. I think we're aided by both things, but what our approach in terms of broadening our distribution, our awareness, but also in terms of just the overall quality of our products at the price that are attracting people that might not have historically known about e.l.f. Our approach is fundamentally different a couple of different ways. One, we really focus on what we call these holy grail innovations, things that we can take inspiration from our community, or the best products and prestige, put our e.l.f twist on and introduced at a much better value. This kind of community-driven approach really helps us. I'll give a recent example. Our community is not afraid to tell us what they want. They recently came to us and said, ""Hey, there's this prestige lip oil, we love it, but it costs $40. I can't afford $40, so e.l.f, help me out, come up with something that is more affordable."" So we'll study that prestige product, we'll say, ""Hey, what do people like?"" They liked that had a glossy finish, color pigmentation was good. Then we'd also ask what they didn't like and they'll say,"" Well, this one dries my lips out sometimes, the applicator's small. "" We'll study that, we'll take all that data in. We will put our e.l.f twist on and we come out with our own lip oils that have a much better hydrating formula, bigger dough foot for application and will introduce some at $8. And like I said the next day, they blow up fire early because people can't believe that this thing is $8 versus the prestige item at $40. So one, that approach of really trying to take the best of beauty but making it accessible, what we call these holy grails, I think is one part of our approach. The second thing we do is instead of these one and done launches, launch something this year and then have to go anniversary next year, introduce even more skews. We tend to focus on franchises. We have a few key franchises. I call our Halo Glow franchise, our power grid, Putty Primer, Camo, and on skin care, Holy hydration and some touchables. What we find is every time we launch something new in a franchise, the entire franchise grows. You have the sustaining growth, and the franchise, it is every one of our franchises have grown every single year. And they've been fed [MUSIC] by innovation, but innovation really shines the light on the overall franchise where you see this continued growth even in your core, in addition to you net worth. They're working in a pretty difficult market. I'd say coffee is one thing, but convincing people to just eat as many donuts as they can possibly. That's a bigger stretch. The older we get, it becomes even more difficult. But I like the idea. Krispy Kreme will continue to generate incremental sales from this, I think it's tremendous brand-building opportunity as well. You just consider how many McDonald's restaurants there are just just in the US alone. I mean, that really is going to put that Krispy Kreme brand front and center at least as far as being the donut expert. I will say Krispy Kreme donuts are better than Dunkin' Donuts. Don't at me. Ultimately Founder and CEO Joe Kiani of Masimo said that this acquisition was in order to help them pursue more of a consumer side of the business wearables. Focusing on a particular market opportunity and hearing aids and etc as those become more accessible to consumers. The investor community has taken this acquisition with total skepticism since it was announced. I just don't think they're very complementary businesses. Activists got in there. It really started pushing for some changes. They wanted to see maybe the separation happen. It's nice to see that it sounds like it's going to happen. They've they've given this plan to the Board. The Board is deliberating it. Kiani would remain the CEO of Masimo, but also will play a role as the Chairman on the consumables side of the business because he really was the one that spearheaded that Sound United acquisition. But the market received the news fairly positively this week. I think to me it makes a lot of sense because the Masimo business on its own is a very successful one, it benefits from that razor and blade model where they get those machines into the hospitals and sell the consumables that are required to make those machines work. Very high-margin revenue there. But when this acquisition was announced, it just seemed very odd and it just hasn't made much more sense. But what the settlement does do is give merchants the power to impose surcharges based on the type of card that they use, which could cause a major chain for consumers who are currently accustomed to like all forms of their card being accepted. If you accept Visa, you accept this Visa card and this Visa card. Now the fees and the prices could be different depending on which type of cards you have, because the fees associated each card under these plants are different. There's the potential for merchants to basically steer consumers toward their preferred cards, which could really change the landscape for Mastercard. "

39,AMZN,"Here's the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock I Think Will Be the Next to Join Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta in the $1 Trillion Club",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-artificial-intelligence-ai-stock-094500701.html,"Few groups are as exclusive as the $1 trillion club. This club has only six members, each a U.S. company with a market capitalization of at least $1 trillion. However, the $1 trillion mark isn't out of reach for Broadcom. The semiconductor and infrastructure software maker's market cap currently tops $610 billion. Sure, the stock needs to jump another 64% or so. But considering Broadcom's shares have more than doubled over the last 12 months, delivering the required gain to join the $1 trillion club doesn't seem too tall a task. Competition in China has intensified, causing Tesla to cut prices to avoid being outflanked. Big automakers in the U.S. are ramping up their EV production. Perhaps most concerning is that consumer interest in buying EVs seems to have stalled. I suspect Taiwan Semi presents a greater threat to beat Broadcom to $1 trillion. The semiconductor maker's market cap is close to $620 billion, neck and neck with Broadcom's. Both companies should benefit from a strong continued demand for chips to power AI applications. However, several rivals are attempting to reduce Taiwan Semi's market dominance. Mainland China's ambition to retake Taiwan could negatively impact Taiwan Semi stock as well as push U.S. and European customers to competitors. Broadcom's risks seem relatively minor compared to those of Taiwan Semi. The company's acquisition of VMware should fuel accelerated growth. Broadcom's main problem is declining broadband sales and telecommunications companies reducing their spending. Since I predict that Broadcom will be the next AI stock to join the $1 trillion club, do I also view the stock as a buy right now? Actually, no. My concern with Broadcom is its valuation. Shares trade at nearly 29 times forward earnings. Yes, the company should generate strong growth over the next few years. Unfortunately, Broadcom's price still isn't compelling to me even with that growth factored in. I expect the company could take longer to reach a market cap of $1 trillion than many investors would like. Before you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this: "
40,AMZN,Best Stock to Buy Right Now: Shopify vs. Walmart,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/best-stock-buy-now-shopify-093000844.html,"Today, both companies are competing more directly than ever. Shopify still retains its e-commerce focus, but Walmart has invested hundreds of millions of dollars to bolster its digital sales channels. So far, Walmart's bet appears to be paying off. With both stocks capable of strong growth in 2024 and beyond, which is a better buy right now? The future is digital. It took Walmart longer than expected to accept this reality, but the company is now fully onboard. After decades of underinvestment, Walmart finally got serious in recent years, investing hundreds of millions of dollars into new automated shipping and fulfillment centers to compete with Amazon's speedy delivery capabilities. Walmart also rolled out new programs like Walmart+, which was modeled after Amazon's Prime service. Shopify, of course, didn't need to copy Walmart's evolution, given that it was a digital-first company from the start. Shopify's e-commerce platform is essentially Amazon on steroids. If merchants want to sell through Amazon, they have to sell on Amazon's terms. If they want to sell through their own channels, it historically took a lot of time and money to set up and run an online storefront. Then Shopify showed up. Its services mean that with a few clicks, anyone can begin selling online with a full host of features and functionality, including easy-to-use web design, inventory tracking, payment processing, and much more. While Walmart is growing sales by 5% to 6% annually, Shopify is growing sales by more than 20% annually. That's the benefit of being a smaller company focused on a higher growth segment of the commerce market. However you slice it, whether it's Walmart's recent push into e-commerce or Shopify's initial e-commerce focus, the future is digital. Right now, both companies are positioned to benefit. Both Shopify and Walmart are betting on digital, and both are seeing success with their strategies. But which stock is a buy right now? Let's take a look at each company's current valuation. All of this paints a clear picture: A bet on Walmart today is a bet on a slower-growth business with high levels of existing cash flow and profits, while Shopify is a high-growth business that is sacrificing near-term cash flow and profitability to keep growth rates elevated. Which stock is right for you? That depends on your time frame and risk tolerance. Shopify has a highly efficient business model with strong competitive advantages. Some calculations show it commands a 28% share of the U.S. e-commerce platform market. Its technology and market share leads should provide a multidecade growth runway, which could eventually make its premium valuation look like a steal. Walmart, meanwhile, is experiencing what could become a multidecade growth runway focused on e-commerce. However, its core business -- physical sales -- is already huge and stagnating. That'll limit growth rates, but the company's reasonable valuation more than reflects that reality. If you're willing to take a little extra risk and commit to a long holding period, Shopify looks like a great choice. Shopify's stock certainly has the most long-term upside. Walmart, however, is still a great pick for more conservative investors, especially if its e-commerce success continues into future years. "

42,AMZN,History Says the Nasdaq Will Soar This Year: My Top Artificial Intelligence (AI) Growth Stocks to Buy Before It Does,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/history-says-nasdaq-soar-top-074500130.html,"And if history is a guide, the Nasdaq's winning streak may not be over. Over the past six periods of stock market gains dating back to 1990, the Nasdaq has climbed an average of 64% in the first two years of positive performance. The index advanced about 43% last year and so far has climbed 8% this year -- so if it follows historical patterns, the Nasdaq could soar this year. Here are my top AI growth stocks to buy before it does... For example, Amazon uses AI to help it streamline fulfillment center operations and select the shortest delivery routes. This is key because it could reduce the company's cost to serve. And AWS has made addressing every level of AI needs a priority, so it offers customers the basics like chips for their training and inference programs as well as a fully managed service that allows them to customize top large language models (LLMs) for their own use. Considering AWS is the world's leading cloud services player, it already has an enormous audience present -- and ready to launch AI projects. So, it's clear AI could have a significant impact on Amazon's earnings growth over time through streamlining e-commerce processes and reducing costs there, and by boosting AWS revenue. On top of this, Intel's move to open its manufacturing network up to others, with the goal to become the world's second-biggest foundry by 2030, could supercharge growth. It's a big bet, but one that could bring major rewards down the road. Intel already has won commitments from four customers for its 18A process and signed five advanced packaging deals. Intel shares trade for 29 times forward earnings estimates, a bargain considering the company's AI and foundry prospects as well as analyst estimates for double-digit annual growth over the next five years. So Intel could be ripe for a rebound, making now an ideal time to get in on this technology giant. Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this: "
43,AMZN,Amazon MGM partners with YouTuber MrBeast to stream 'Beast Games',https://finance.yahoo.com/video/amazon-mgm-partners-youtuber-mrbeast-213526676.html,"Pastor emphasizes that it is an ""unbelievable time"" to be a part of the media industry, given the tremendous amount of change underway. Drawing on his experience dating back to when cable was emerging, Pastor notes that streaming is now ""the topic du jour."" Regarding the MrBeast deal, Pastor explains that projects with ""stars attached"" to them in Hollywood tend to reduce risk and boost engagement, stressing that the Amazon-MrBeast collaboration is a ""tried and true"" model. However, he highlights that this deal also opens the door for other content creators on YouTube to ""build out incredible franchises"" beyond just the YouTube platform itself— which will benefit both the influencer class and the production companies involved. And Paul, thank you so much for joining us. First of all, just to set the stage here. Talk to us about what Quickplay does and sort of your view on the streaming industry from where you sit. So what is a tier one operator means? It means somebody who has a very complex ecosystem that's maybe managing legacy systems and legacy business models, as well as current and future ones with streaming. They happen to have really-- they want control of their roadmap, and they want to make sure that they can respond to the various needs of their consumers. And importantly, they have very big executives who often come in with a request or demand that are looking for new features, new innovations that lead the market. And they're looking for platforms like ourselves to help them drive that change in their organization. In terms of the industry, it's an unbelievable time to be involved in the industry. We're seeing a tremendous amount of change. I started in the industry when cable was being developed. And then we had digital terrestrial television. That was in the process of transforming the industry. And now, most of the business models that I set up maybe 20 years ago have now folded as now streaming becomes the topic Du Jour. But there's a tremendous number of trends in the industry at this moment that I'm sure you're seeing. First and foremost, obviously, there's a tremendous amount of focus on cost at this moment where streamers are rationalizing their content investment, their marketing investment, and importantly, their technology investment. Second, you've seen a tremendous amount of consolidation in industry where people are looking to aggregate in order to offer a better value proposition to consumers. And then fundamentally, there is the management and focus on profitability as they sunset many of their older businesses that were huge profit drivers and transform these into their new profit drivers. So this is a very tried and true model. What Amazon has done and stealing the talent from YouTube or borrowing or leveraging the brand from YouTube into their program with a huge prize. They made a huge splash. But let's not forget that there's other businesses that are out there that are fundamentally pursuing the very same thing, which is how to democratize content through YouTube like a pocket watch or a Moonbug that focus on the kids area, but then build out these incredible franchises that they then take to more traditional streaming or traditional media platforms. Another one you sell was Morphy. For example, that was announced this year coming from YouTube from Moonbug that will now be available on Disney and Disney Plus. So this is most certainly a model that Hollywood is familiar with. It presents a great opportunity, obviously, for influencers and those who build their brands in these more democratized platforms to be able to extend that IP, to extend their talents, and really grow what is basically a production company and franchise business through these other various platforms.

Guidance incorporates order trends to date and assumptions which may not accurately predict demand for goods and services. The cost to serve has been reduced for the first time since 2018, indicating previous years of increased costs. International segment reported an operating loss of $419 million, despite an improvement of $1.8 billion year-over-year. CapEx is expected to increase year-over-year in 2024, primarily driven by increased infrastructure CapEx to support growth of AWS. "
45,AMZN,Where Will Amazon Stock Be in 1 Year?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/where-amazon-stock-1-210800798.html,"Amazon still remains a few dollars below its record high of $186.12 set on July 8, 2021. But could it rally even more and set new all-time highs over the next 12 months? In 2020, Amazon's revenue surged 38% after the pandemic drove more people to shop online and more businesses upgraded their cloud-based services. Its sales rose another 22% in 2021. But in 2022, its revenue only increased 9% as the pandemic waned, inflation curbed consumer spending, and companies reined in their cloud spending to cope with higher interest rates and other macro headwinds. In 2023, Amazon's sales climbed 12% after its North American, international, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) businesses rebounded. That acceleration suggested the company had finally passed its cyclical trough and was primed to grow again. Metric Q4 2022 Q1 2023 Q2 2023 Q3 2023 Q4 2023 North America sales growth (YOY) 13% 11% 11% 11% 13% International sales growth (YOY) (8%) 1% 10% 16% 17% AWS sales growth (YOY) 20% 16% 12% 12% 13% Total sales growth (YOY) 9% 9% 11% 13% 14% Data source: Amazon. YOY = year over year. Amazon's recovery in North America was driven by faster delivery speeds, more orders for everyday essentials, and the expansion of its advertising business. Its overseas growth was fueled by its move into more emerging markets. So to get a clearer view of Amazon's profitability, we should exclude its underwater investment in Rivian and focus on its operating margin, which expanded from 5.9% in 2020 to 6.4% in 2023 after it cut costs and laid off thousands of workers. In 2025, analysts expect Amazon's revenue and EPS to grow 12% and 26%, respectively. We should take those estimates with a grain of salt, but they imply that the worst is over and that it can overcome its macro and competitive headwinds. Based on those expectations, Amazon's stock trades at 43 times forward earnings. Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this: "

47,AMZN,11 Best Technology Penny Stocks To Invest In Now,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/11-best-technology-penny-stocks-200912104.html,"Yet another stronger-than-expected jobs report published on Friday is further dampening investors’ hopes of seeing the first rate cut from the Federal Reserve in June. Analysts have started to predict that the Federal Reserve might further delay its first rate cut to avoid seeing a strong rebound in inflation down the road. Piper Sandler said in its fresh note that latest data is showing the US labor market is “even stronger than we thought and maybe getting stronger.” Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial in Troy, Michigan, also said in a note that investors are beginning to digest the possibility of not seeing three rate cuts this year. He thinks the Fed could cut rates twice this year, but it’s still early to say anything. ""If the economy is running the way it's running now through most of this year, then it might be likely that the Fed does not cut interest rates this year,” Saglimbene added. “High-quality small cap companies have delivered stronger returns than the small cap universe, with lower volatility. Since 1976, small cap quality has outperformed the small cap asset class in the U.S. by 1.8% annualized and has also outperformed the all-cap U.S. market by 2.8% annualized. These more predictable, long-term winners are very often undervalued by the market, buried under the buzz of stocks long on narrative but short on fundamental stability.” But how have small-cap and micro-cap stocks been performing this year? Invesco S&P SmallCap Information Technology ETF (PSCT), which invests in small-cap technology stocks, is up just 5.80% over the past one year, compared to the S&P 500’s return of 27%. So far this year, the ETF is down 3.56%. But artificial intelligence is doing its wonders in the small-cap space too, since smaller names like Super Micro and MicroStrategy, part of the small-cap focused Russell 2000, poste huge returns on the back of the AI wave. A recent Wall Street Journal report said, citing data from LSEG, that these two companies collectively accounted for about a third of the Russell 2000’s 5.2% return in the first quarter. Mobile advertising and app growth solutions company Digital Turbine Inc (NASDAQ:APPS) ranks 11th in our list of the best technology penny stocks to invest in now according to hedge funds. As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 19 hedge funds had stakes in Digital Turbine Inc (NASDAQ:APPS). The biggest stakeholder of Digital Turbine Inc (NASDAQ:APPS) during this period was D. E. Shaw which owns a $13 million stake in Digital Turbine Inc (NASDAQ:APPS). Virginia-based IT and cybersecurity company Telos Corp (NASDAQ:TLS) ranks 10th in our list of the best technology penny stocks hedge funds are piling into. Earlier this month Telos Corp (NASDAQ:TLS) posted fourth quarter results. Adjusted EPS in the period came in at -$0.09, beating estimates by $0.02. Revenue in the quarter jumped 13.3% year over year to $41.06 million, surpassing estimates by $8.95 million. Out of the 933 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database, 20 hedge funds had stakes in Telos Corp (NASDAQ:TLS) as of the end of the last quarter of 2023. Unlike Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), TLS is a small company that does not get much attention from the market. Action camera company GoPro Inc. (NASDAQ:GPRO) is one of the penny stocks hedge funds are buying. Insider Monkey’s proprietary database of 933 hedge funds shows that 20 funds had stakes in GoPro Inc. (NASDAQ:GPRO) as of the end of the last year.

Earlier this year GoPro Inc. (NASDAQ:GPRO) said it plans to cut 4% of its total workforce to cut costs. California-based clean energy storage solutions company Stem Inc (NYSE:STEM) ranks eighth in our list of the best technology penny stocks to invest in according to smart money investors. Out of the 21 hedge funds that had stakes in Stem Inc (NYSE:STEM) as of the end of the last quarter of 2023, Panayotis Takis Sparaggis’s Alkeon Capital Management had the biggest stake in Stem Inc (NYSE:STEM) with a $28 million stake.

In addition to small companies, hedge funds are also buying Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). Voice over IP products and solutions company 8X8 Inc. (NASDAQ:EGHT) ranks seventh in our list of the best technology penny stocks to invest in according to hedge funds. In February, Bank of America published a list of buy-rated small cap value stocks. BofA said these stocks have strong profit growth and perform well when rate hikes are stopped. 8X8 Inc.  (NASDAQ:EGHT) made it to this list. As of the end of the last quarter of 2023, 21 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in 8X8 Inc. (NASDAQ:EGHT). Missouri-based personalized learning platform company Nerdy Inc (NYSE:NRDY) is one of the best technology penny stocks hedge funds are buying.

48,AMZN,"Why ""Magnificent Seven"" Stocks Meta and Amazon Rallied Today, While Tesla Stock Tapped the Brakes",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-magnificent-seven-stocks-meta-183031918.html,"Since the beginning of last year, the group of stocks collectively referred to as the ""Magnificent Seven"" has helped push the market higher. The combination of industry-leading positions and connections to artificial intelligence (AI) has made this group of high-profile stocks a must-have for many investors. However, since the beginning of 2024, there's been a divergence, and while some members continue to pull their weight, others have fallen short. Meta Platforms investors were optimistic today after the social media company responded to allegations by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) that it violated a 2020 privacy agreement. The settlement banned the company from profiting from data related to minors. The FTC sought to amend the accord, but Meta pushed back, saying it ""voluntarily disclosed the technical errors"" detected in its Messenger Kids app. The FTC is looking to impose additional restrictions on Meta, which could ultimately be more costly. Investors welcomed the company's response to regulators. Meanwhile, a couple of things appear to be moving Amazon stock. Reports have emerged that the company is cutting a number of jobs in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing segment as it seeks to rein in costs. The company is reportedly eliminating hundreds of positions, including those in marketing, sales, and global services. Furthermore, in an overhaul of its Amazon Fresh stores, the company announced it is eliminating its ""Just Walk Out"" technology from stores in the U.S., replacing the costly systems with smart shopping carts. This move will also likely save Amazon money over the long term, and investors applauded the cost-saving measures. The move is designed to clear out the company's massive backlog of inventory, as Tesla reported manufacturing 46,000 more vehicles than it delivered in the first quarter. This will likely have a negative impact on Tesla's bottom line for the current quarter. Additionally, according to a report by Reuters, Tesla has decided to scrap plans to build a lower-priced model. The project has been on the drawing board for years, and a less-costly model was seen as a way to appeal to a broader cross-section of the car market. If Tesla were to abandon this long-term goal, this could impact how investors view the company's future prospects. It's worth noting that CEO Elon Musk reportedly refuted the claims on social media. From a valuation standpoint, Meta is the cheapest of our trio of stocks, selling for just 26 times forward earnings, compared to multiples of 44 and 59 for Amazon and Tesla, respectively. To be clear, each of the Magnificent Seven stocks has the potential to lead the market higher again, but investors will require strong business and financial performance before fueling further gains. Before you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this: "

50,TSLA,Tesla: Analyst explains retail investors' devotion to the stock,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/tesla-analyst-explains-retail-investors-155953799.html,"""Tesla is a very, very special stock, number one for the charismatic leader, the fact that Elon Musk is really a pretty amazing guy, and has executed. He's not executed to his dreams. But he's greatly outstripped... of what was expected of him originally,"" Irwin states, adding: ""Overall sustainability and cleantech has been sort of slow to gain traction, but it's seeing really good traction... across the board in different areas now. So retail loves Tesla. Retail does not love sustainability right now. And... Tesla is a special company for that."" But when you take a look at the momentum specifically in Tesla's stock, how does that differ from others within your coverage space just in terms of the fact that so many of these investors are big believers in Elon Musk himself and just simply getting excited about what could happen in the future is enough to make some investors buy at this point? Tesla is a very, very special stock, right? Number one, for the charismatic leader, the fact that Elon Musk is really a pretty amazing guy and has executed. You know, he's not executed to his dreams, but he's greatly outstripped what he said-- well, what was expected of him originally. I remember the early debates of 20,000 cars. What would Tesla look like if they produced 20,000 cars shortly after the IPO. You know, it's an amazing company. The rest of the space has had challenges. There are some more mature companies. My colleague Phil Shen covers the solar space where we see many more comparable companies, but nothing in the hundreds of billions of market value. The overall sustainability and clean tech has been sort of slow to gain traction, but is seeing really good traction across the board in different areas now. So retail loves Tesla. Retail does not love sustainability right now. And you know, Tesla is a special company for that. "

52,TSLA,"Tesla, Boeing, Coinbase: Trending tickers",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/tesla-boeing-coinbase-trending-tickers-140517034.html,"A number of stocks are on the move Monday morning. Looking to reverse some of those steep losses that we saw at the end of last week. And it comes after Elon Musk posted on his platform X that robotaxis will be coming August 8. Obviously, Tesla is one of those volatile names on Wall Street. The shares are down more than 30% since the start of the year. There's been a lot of talk whether or not it should be kicked out of the Mag Seven. But what Elon Musk says usually sways the stock in one way or another, which is what we're seeing this morning. Now, important to note here that Tesla has been talking about autonomous tech for quite some time that ultimately hasn't come to fruition at this point. Tesla also faces some stiff competition, both domestically and abroad in China. So if they are going to go all in on robotaxis, it's going to be a bit of an uphill battle there. But investors certainly seem optimistic at this point, given the upside to shares this morning. I want to take also a look at Boeing. This stock moving in the opposite direction of Tesla. Shares really moving flat. They were lower in pre-market trading right now. But this comes as this company just really can't seem to catch a break, yet another event when it relates to one of its planes. The FAA is now investigating an incident in which an engine cover fell off of a Southwest flight during takeoff on Sunday, the latest in a string of very high profile events that have plagued this company. Earlier this year, we saw a door panel flow float off of an Alaskan Airlines flight. And Bernstein out with a new note this morning, saying that Boeing has really been in purgatory on the heels of these events. That being said, though, Bernstein does have an outperform rating on shares across Wall Street. Boeing has 20 buys, 12 holds, and just one sell. So going to be interesting to track how this stock continues to perform. Shares are off about 30%. And then finally, I want to end on Coinbase. This stock climbing higher today, up more than 5% as Bitcoin prices rise above 72,000 a coin. We saw the crypto exchange close in the red at the end of last week after Cathie Wood's Ark Invest unloaded another $15 million worth of Coinbase shares across two of her ETFs there. But on top of these positive Bitcoin moves, Barclays, this morning, also raising the price target on Coinbase to 179 bucks a share. That's up from 146, citing increased spot trading volumes. We know that a lot of these crypto exchanges. They move in tandem with the price of Bitcoin. So yet another name that we're going to continue to watch throughout the trading day this morning. Seana?

53,TSLA,Putin seeks emergency petrol as Russia runs on fumes,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/putin-seeks-emergency-petrol-russia-165745269.html,"Russia has reportedly asked Kazakhstan to supply it with petrol as Ukrainian attacks on its refineries force it to import gasoline. Kazakhstan has been asked to set up a reserve of 100,000 tonnes of gasoline, equivalent to 845,000 barrels, to supply Russia should shortages arise, Reuters reported. It is unclear if a deal has been reached. The Kremlin has also been seeking supplies from Belarus. Russia is normally an exporter of gasoline but Ukrainian drone attacks have significantly hit its refining capabilities, forcing it to rely on imports to meet demand. Drone attacks have hit Russian refineries at least 12 times, including five in March alone, and can range hundreds of miles inside Russian territory. Ukraine has turned to attacks on Russian infrastructure as a way of hitting its wartime economy as neither side makes territorial gains on the ground. More than 10pc of Russia’s refining capacity has been taken offline by the strikes, according to the Ministry of Defence. A major Russian refinery on the border of Kazakhstan was also forced to shut down over the weekend due to heavy flooding. Last month Russia banned gasoline exports for six months, which it said would allow prices to remain stable and give it time to repair refinery facilities. It had previously introduced a ban between September and November. In both cases, neighbouring ex-Soviet states are exempt from the ban. Last year it exported 5.8m tonnes of gasoline, roughly 13pc of its total production. Certain parts of the country have suffered shortages, while gasoline prices hace risen. The Russian government has said the attacks are not having a significant impact on the Russian economy because it is simply exporting more oil that it is unable to refine into petrol. Kazakhstan has implemented its own ban on petrol exports for almost two years, saying it is seeking to balance supply and demand. Thanks for joining us today. We’ll be back covering the markets tomorrow morning but I’ll leave you with a couple of the latest reports from The Telegraph’s business team: Accolade Wines, the UK’s biggest wine company, blamed searing inflation for a 500pc increase in pre-tax losses to £11m in the year to 30 June 2023. Losses skyrocketed from £1.8m the previous year to £10.8m despite a £23m rise in sales to £450m, company accounts showed. Derek Nicol, European managing director at Accolade Wines, said: “The company’s performance has been impacted by exogenous factors over the last three years including ‘black swan’ events such as the Covid-19 pandemic and the invasion of Ukraine, which have resulted in unprecedented and material inflation of the company’s cost base particularly in relation to shipping costs.” Based in Woking, Surrey, Accolade Wines bottles many of the UK’s best-known supermarket wine brands, including Echo Falls, Hardy’s, Banrock Station and Mud House. Mr Nicol admitted in the accounts that the company had raised its prices in 2023 but said it would push them higher in 2024. A bottle of Hardys Crest Chardonnay has risen from £7 in 2022 to £8 currently in Tesco, research with internet archive tool The Wayback Machine shows, while a bottle of Mud House Sauvignon Blanc has increased from £9 to £10.50. Accolade’s global parent company is headquartered in Adelaide. It said in February that it would be taken over by a consortium of investors led by the private equity giant Bain & Co, who had been buying up its debt at a discount. It was previously controlled by Carlyle which owns the Spanish wine producer Codorniu Reserve. The consortium is plotting a recapitalisation of the business, which has come under pressure since the pandemic. “Like all Australian winemakers, we have been hit by a number of challenging macroeconomic and industry headwinds in recent years,” Accolade’s global chief executive Robert Foye said in February as the deal was announced. Patisserie chain Cake Box has told investors its profits for the year to March 31 will be better than expected after boosting online sales and launching new products. It says that sales should be up 9pc year-on-year, reaching around £37.9m. The chain added an extra 20 shops during the year. It believes there is scope to grow its current estate from 225 stores to 400 over time. Cake Box began in 2008, founded by vegetarians who wanted to supply cakes that were egg free but still contained fresh cream. Sukh Chamdal, chief executive, said the baker had “delivered a year of solid growth in all our key performance areas and full year profits slightly above expectations despite the backdrop of uncertain macroeconomic conditions.” Shares rose 2.5pc today. Tesco has unveiled plans to invest $25m (£20m) in a fund to back grocery start-ups, as retailers look for new technologies that can help improve store visits. The British supermarket has partnered with chains including Australia’s Woolworths Group and Africa’s biggest grocery retailer Shoprite to launch a $125m venture capital fund. The fund will back start-ups working on technology that can make shoppers’ experience better in stores or on making supermarkets and the food system more environmentally-friendly with products such as more sustainable packaging. Tesco will contribute $25m to the fund over the next five years. Ken Murphy, the chief executive, said the grocer was “passionate about seeking out the best innovations”. It comes amid signs of change across the grocery market, with Amazon recently unveiling plans to ditch its “Just Walk Out” cashier-free shopping technology in US stores. Instead Amazon said it would be using more of its Dash Cart systems, which tracks items as shoppers put them in their trolleys. The FTSE 100 rose 0.4pc today. The biggest riser was Ladbrokes owner Entain, up 5.23pc, followed by Rio Tinto, up 4.2pc. The biggest fallers were accountancy software business Sage, down 2.8pc, followed by PaddyPower owner Flutter, down 2.3pc. Meanwhile, the mid-cap FTSE 350 rose 0.65pc. The biggest riser was mining company Hochschild, up 6.8pc, followed by PPHE Hotel Group, up 6.7pc. The biggest faller was WAG Payments, down 2.6pc, followed by South West Water owner Pennon Group, down 2.5pc. Global stock markets have advanced slightly today as oil prices retreated after a recent rally. Oil prices fell as geopolitical tensions eased somewhat after Israel withdrew more soldiers from southern Gaza. Talks on a truce began on Sunday and continued on Monday although a Hamas official said no progress had been made, despite Egyptian sources saying headway had been achieved. Stock markets had made a slow start to the second quarter as the risk of a broader conflict in the Middle East had pushed up oil prices to their highest level since October. A much stronger-than-expected US jobs report on Friday, which followed solid manufacturing data at the start of the week, caused investors to temper bets on a Federal Reserve rate cut in June. US Treasury yields moved higher on Monday as fixed income investors lowered their expectations for how deeply the Fed will be able to cut interest rates this year after the jobs report. The yield on benchmark US 10-year Treasury bonds rose to 4.42pc, from 4.378pc late on Friday. Market pricing on Monday showed traders see a roughly 48pc chance of a Fed cut in June, down from around 59pc a week ago. Investors will be eagerly looking at the US consumer price index (CPI) figure which is out on Wednesday. This is expected to show core inflation, which strips out volatile energy and food prices, slowing to 3.7pc in March from 3.8pc the prior month. Paddy Cosgrave quit after accusing Israel of war crimes in Gaza days after Hamas’s October 7 massacre. At the time, he said: “War crimes are war crimes even when they are committed by allies.” He later apologised for the remarks and condemned Hamas’s “monstrous attack”, however major sponsors withdrew from the conference and speakers threatened to pull out. Mr Cosgrave said on Monday he would be returning to run the events business, which holds its flagship event in November. He said: “I took the time to reconnect with old Web Summit friends and I listened to what they had to say and what they wanted from Web Summit.” Tesla shares have jumped more than 5pc today after investors looked favourably on the carmarker’s ability to make money out of self-driving taxis. The news, on Friday, sent Tesla shares downwards. Investors need to curb some of their enthusiasm with this stock and its various product announcements, as there tends to be a wide chasm between hype/speculation and reality. This seems to be an example of Tesla trying to distract from the current EV market conditions, which are very bleak at the moment. The world’s largest independent commodities trader has posted large profits for the second year running after the Ukraine war sent shockwaves through the markets. Vitol reportedly raked in profits of $13bn (£10bn) in 2023, down from $15bn in 2022 but still substantially higher than its pre-war earnings. The figures, first reported by the Financial Times, underline how the company and others like it have been able to capitalise on widespread turmoil that has gripped parts of global supply chains since Russia attacked Ukraine in February 2022. Amid Western sanctions and a decision by many businesses to stop doing business with Russia, companies have been forced to overhaul parts of their operations or find new suppliers. That has triggered a scramble for alternative resources and created lucrative opportunities for commodity traders like Vitol. “The scale of this realignment should not be underestimated,” said Russell Hardy, the company’s chief executive, in comments last month about the rerouting of Russian oil shipments. A spokesperson for Vitol declined to comment. The healthy profits are likely to mean another year of big payouts for the roughly 450 people who own Vitol’s partnership shares. The Financial Reporting Council found the company made “material errors” during a major local authority audit for the year ending March 2021. The UK accounting watchdog’s enforcement committee said these failures represented a “significant departure” from the standards expected of a registered auditor and had the potential to affect the public, employees, pensioners or creditors. These included “two uncorrected material errors” in the pension fund’s audited financial statements that were included in the local authority’s annual report, which did not feature in the pension fund’s own financial statements. They also found that Grant Thornton failed to obtain sufficient evidence that the value of the pension fund’s investments was “materially accurate”. The Financial Reporting Council said that a sanction was necessary to ensure Grant Thornton’s local audit functions are undertaken, supervised and managed effectively. The Financial Reporting Council said: “The Committee acknowledges that Grant Thornton UK LLP provided co-operation, including at an early stage, took appropriate remedial steps promptly once the failing was identified and demonstrated contrition. “There was also no evidence to support financial gain or benefit from the failure.” Grant Thornton has accepted the sanction and has issued written undertakings in response to the penalty. A Grant Thornton spokesman said: “We note the findings of the regulator’s investigation, with which we have cooperated throughout, and regret the errors identified. “As a leading provider of audit and related assurance services to the public sector, we remain committed to high-quality work and have taken steps to further improve this.” Janet Yellen has been in talks with the Chinese government to discourage its economy from dumping subsidised electric cars and other goods in the US. But Chinese premier Li Qiang has pushed back on Ms Yellen’s message, according to the state news agency Xinhua, which quoted him saying that the US should “refrain from turning economic and trade issues into political or security issues” and view the issue of production capacity from a “market-oriented and global perspective”. Chinese Commerce Minister Wang Wentao voiced more pointed objections during a roundtable meeting with Chinese vehicle (EV) makers, saying that US and European assertions of Chinese excess EV capacity were groundless. He said: China’s electric vehicle companies rely on continuous technological innovation, perfect production and supply chain system and full market competition for rapid development, not relying on subsidies to gain competitive advantage. British companies are being eyed up in a major way for foreign takeovers, according to Bloomberg. British stocks accounted for 70pc of businesses mentioned at least twice in a survey of 18 risk-arbitrage desks, traders and analysts conducted by Bloomberg last month. Takeover targets included gambling firm 888 Holdings and insurance company Direct Line. US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told reporters today that the United States will not accept new industries being decimated by subsidised Chinese imports in the same way that the US steel sector was crushed a decade ago. After wrapping up four days of talks with Chinese officials, Ms Yellen told a news conference the exchanges had advanced American interests. She said she had raised concerns about China’s weak domestic demand and overinvestment in industries such as electric vehicles, batteries and solar products, fueled by “large-scale government support”. She added: “We’ve seen this story before. Over a decade ago, massive [People’s Republic of China] government support led to below-cost Chinese steel that flooded the global market and decimated industries across the world and in the United States. I’ve made it clear that President Biden and I will not accept that reality again. Yellen said that when the global market is flooded with artificially cheap Chinese products, “the viability of American and other foreign firms is put into question.” Sales of Prime, a sports drink heavily promoted on social media, have taken a plunge, according to a report. The drink, launched by the wrestler Logan Paul and the boxer KSI, was an instant hit. But according to The Grocer, sales are now in freefall. The trade publication says that in the first quarter of 2024, its sales of £12.8m are less than half the £26.8m it sold a year earlier. Prime Hydration UK has been approached for comment. Russia has reportedly asked Kazakhstan to supply it with petrol as Ukrainian attacks on its refineries force it to import gasoline. Kazakhstan has been asked to set up a reserve of 100,000 tonnes of gasoline, equivalent to 845,000 barrels, to supply Russia should shortages arise, Reuters reported. It is unclear if a deal has been reached. The Kremlin has also been seeking supplies from Belarus.

Kazakhstan has implemented its own ban on petrol exports for almost two years, saying it is seeking to balance supply and demand. Ted Baker will cut almost 250 jobs as it shuts down one in three stores across the UK, the fashion retailer’s administrators have said. Eleven loss-making Ted Baker locations will shut down by next Friday, restructuring firm Teneo announced on Monday. It said a further four had cancelled their leases before its UK and Europe retail entity, No Ordinary Designer Label, was placed into administration last month, and will close in the coming weeks. Around 245 jobs will be lost in total as a result of the closures, with 25 of those at the company’s head office. Authentic Brands Group, the American owners of Ted Baker’s UK and Europe retail operations, put the company into administration in late March saying it had accumulated “a significant level of arrears” and blaming its former owners, the Dutch company AARC. It is looking for a new owner of the retail business. Teneo said that after a review it had determined that the 11 stores “have no prospect of being returned to profitability, even with material rent reductions”. It added: “As such, their closure is believed to be a constructive and necessary step in ensuring the business can deliver a profitable trading performance in the future.” The company runs 46 Ted Baker stores in the UK as well as concessions in airports and department stores. Shell, one of the London Stock Exchange’s biggest companies, has suggested it could abandon the UK listing in favour of New York, something that would be the biggest blow to date to the LSE. The energy boss said the current undervaluation presented a “fantastic investment opportunity”, adding: “I will keep buying back those shares, and buying back those shares at a discount.” But he pointed to the gap in valuation between Shell and its New York-listed rivals Exxon Mobil and Chevron and acknowledged the company may have to take more drastic action if that gulf is not resolved by the end of next year. Mr Sawan told Bloomberg: “If we work through the sprint, and we are doing what we are doing, and we still don’t see that the gap is closing, we have to look at all options.” John Lewis has appointed a new chairman to replace Dame Sharon White as the mutual battles to revive its fortunes. The John Lewis Partnership, which runs the department store chain and Waitrose stores, said Jason Tarry, the former UK boss of Tesco, would be joining as its seventh chairman later this year, following a search which kicked off last October. Mr Tarry stepped down as Tesco’s UK and Ireland chief executive last month after more than 33 years at the grocery giant. He had led Tesco’s UK operations for six years and was credited for his critical role in steering the supermarket through the pandemic. When he stepped down, Tesco boss Ken Murphy said he had made the supermarket “the most competitive we have ever been”. Mr Tarry’s appointment as John Lewis’s next chairman comes as the partnership refocuses back on its core retail business, having shelved plans to rapidly shift away from the high street. Dame Sharon, commenting on her successor, said Mr Tarry had a “fantastic retail experience with leadership through transformation”. The two billionaires on-again, off-again plans for a cage match last year never materialised, but Meta’s founder Mark Zuckerberg has got one over on Twitter owner Elon Musk in one respect: his net worth has overtaken Mr Musk’s for the first time since 2020. As recently as a month ago Mr Musk was the richest person in the world. However, his net worth has sunk on the back of Tesla’s falling share price. The stock has dropped by a third so far this year amid mounting competition from Chinese rivals and production issues in Europe. The company’s stock, which accounts for much of the billionaire’s net worth, fell by more than 6pc last week after it reported weaker than expected vehicle deliveries. Mr Musk has lost an estimated $48.8bn so far this year as a result of the stock downturn. Conversely, the billionaires around him on the rich list have all made significant gains. The US government has awarded the Taiwanese semiconductor giant TSMC $11.6bn (£9.2bn) in grants and loans to help fund a state-of-the-art facility in Arizona. TSMC is known as the world’s most advanced semiconductor manufacturing company, making chips that are used in the iPhone as well as the top AI processors for companies like Nvidia. However, its high-end manufacturing is located largely in Taiwan, which is seen as a potential liability due to the democracy being coveted by Chinese president Xi Jinping. TSMC already has plans to develop two facilities in Phoenix but this package will help fund a factory that will produce the most advanced “2-nanometer” designs. The funding comes from Joe Biden’s CHIPS and Science Act, which has allocated billions for boosting US semiconductor production. A surge in fixed-rate mortgages has weakened the Bank of England’s ability to fight inflation after the UK saw one of the biggest global increases in people locking in their borrowing costs, according to the International Monetary Fund. The IMF said the UK now had one of the highest shares of people on fixed-rate mortgages in the world, helping to delay the pain of higher rates for millions of borrowers. The share of British households who have opted to fix their borrowing costs - usually for two or five years - has climbed from around a third in 2011 to almost 90pc at the end of 2022, according to the IMF. More recent data published by the Financial Conduct Authority suggests this share has remained stable. Previously, most home owners tied their mortgage costs directly to the Bank of England base rate, which climbed from 0.1pc in late 2021 to 5.25pc last year. “Central banks have raised interest rates significantly over the past two years to combat post-pandemic inflation,” the IMF said. “Many thought this would lead to a slowdown in economic activity. Yet, global growth has held broadly steady, with deceleration only materialising in some countries.” The IMF also signalled UK households were unlikely to suffer a mortgage shock once their fixed-rate deals expire, with overall household debt shares remaining below pre-financial crisis levels. Industrial production figures from Germany this morning suggest the country may escape a slide into recession. Germany’s official statistics office says this morning that industrial production grew by 2.1pc in February, above economists’ forecasts of a 0.5pc rise. The German economy declined by 0.3pc in the final quarter of 2023 and a further contraction at the start of this year would tip the country into a technical recession. Economists had expected that Germany would fall into recession but the outlook has improved in recent days and today’s figures are likely to provide more evidence of that. The FTSE 100 is off to a slow start as a new trading week begins, trading at 7,905, barely moving from Friday’s close. Miners Fresnillo, Rio Tinto and Anglo American are leading the charge higher on signs of higher demand for iron ore, while industrial products group RS Group is at the bottom of the pack, down around 1.5pc. The FTSE 250 is also treading water. Payments group W.A.G. is the biggest gainer while life sciences company IP Group is down 4.71pc. The company says the division will work on consumer AI projects and will be lead by Jordan Hoffman, a former scientist at Google’s DeepMind lab. Microsoft recently hired DeepMind co-founder Mustafa Suleyman to run its consumer AI efforts, as well as the majority of the team from his start-up, Inflection. Companies such as OpenAI and Anthropic have also set up offices in London in recent months amid a race for AI talent. Microsoft are not saying how many engineers will work at the AI hub. Here’s Mr Suleyman’s statement: There is an enormous pool of AI talent and expertise in the U.K., and Microsoft AI plans to make a significant, long-term investment in the region as we begin hiring the best AI scientists and engineers into this new AI hub. In the coming weeks and months, we will be posting job openings and actively hiring exceptional individuals who want to work on the most interesting and challenging AI questions of our time. We’re looking for new team members who are driven by impact at scale, and who are passionate innovators eager to contribute to a team culture where continuous learning is the norm. CVS Group, the London-listed veterinary services provider which owns around 500 practices in the UK, Australia, Netherlands and Ireland including The Vet Collection chain, says hackers gained “unauthorised external access to a limited number of its IT systems”. The attack has affected emails, phone lines and online forms. It says it has detected and intercepted the attack, which has limited the cyber incident, but that there is an “ongoing operational impact” on the company within the UK, meaning services in the country are continuing to be affected. “IT services to our practices and business functions have now been securely restored across the majority of the estate; however, due to the increased levels of security and monitoring, some systems are not working as efficiently as previously and this is likely to result in an ongoing operational impact,” it says. The Vet Collection’s website says: “We are having issues with our online forms and emails, please call your practice for appointments and queries.” Meanwhile, multiple Facebook pages for practices in the group show that phone lines were not working last week, with pet owners urged to contact them only in emergencies. Thanks for joining us. Retail insolvencies have climbed by almost a fifth over the past year, as higher interest rates hit Britain’s debt-laden stores. Almost 2,200 retailers collapsed in the year to the end of January, according to new figures from accountancy firm Mazars. This was up from 1,843 a year earlier and represents a 19pc increase year on year. Mazars said higher interest rates were causing “significant problems” for retailers burdened by high levels of debt. It follows years when companies loaded up on cheaper debt before interest rates began to rise. The Bank of England has held rates at 5.25pc since last August, making the cost of refinancing debt much more expensive. Rebecca Dacre, a partner at Mazars, said: “We are unlikely to see the retail sector trading comfortably until interest rates start to fall.” It has added to pressure on retailers at a time when shoppers have cut back on spending and inflation has driven up labour costs. Most retailers are also being hit by a rise in business rates as of this month. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei is up 0.91pc at 39,347.04, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng is up 0.41pc at 16,792.89. "

U.S. stocks recorded weekly losses on Friday as traders scaled back expectations on the timing of rate cuts. They now see an around 51% chance of the Fed announcing its first rate cut in June, according to the CME FedWatch Tool, down from about 58% at the beginning of last week. Hawkish commentary from central bank officials last week and stronger-than-expected manufacturing and jobs reports pointed to a resilient U.S. economy, easing the pressure on the Fed to cut interest rates quickly. The market also pared back expectations of more than three rate cuts this year, from between three and four a few weeks ago, according to LSEG data. ""The data firmly supports that with stable inflation and the above trend growth that we've seen, there's becoming less and less of a need for any sort of immediate cuts,"" said Mike Dickson, head of research at Horizon Investments. The yield on 10-year Treasury notes rose to its highest level since last November earlier in the session. It later pared some gains and was last at 4.4339%. Market focus now shifts to the March reading of the U.S. Consumer Price Index, due later in the week, that is expected to show a rise in headline inflation to 3.4% year-on-year, from 3.2% in February. Also on the radar is the release of minutes from the Fed's latest meeting, where it stuck to its guidance of three rate cuts in 2024. Investors await commentary from Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee and his Minneapolis counterpart Neel Kashkari later in the day for policy cues. First-quarter earnings season picks up pace now, with banking giants JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo scheduled to report later in the week. ""In an environment where you've got higher rates, it makes earnings growth even more important, and expectations for earnings growth are fairly elevated,"" Dickson said. Meanwhile, Wells Fargo raised its year-end target for the benchmark S&P 500 index to 5,535 - the highest among Wall Street brokerages - from its previous forecast of 4,625​. Leading gains across megacap growth stocks, Tesla rose 5.2% after CEO Elon Musk said the company would unveil the Robotaxi on Aug. 8. At 11:30 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 39.32 points, or 0.10%, at 38,943.36, the S&P 500 was up 6.92 points, or 0.13%, at 5,211.26, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 39.14 points, or 0.24%, at 16,287.66. Eight of the 11 S&P 500 sectors advanced, with consumer discretionary leading gains, while health care lagged. Cryptocurrency-related stocks gained, tracking rising bitcoin prices. Exchange operator Coinbase Global and software firm MicroStrategy added 6.2% and 5.5%, respectively. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2.11-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 1.63-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&P index recorded 19 new 52-week highs and two new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 58 new highs and 59 new lows.

It shot up to all-time highs (ATHs) of nearly $0.75, at which point it had a market cap of about $100 billion. The price has fallen significantly since then but is up over 100% YTD. The price run in 2024 has been the result of many factors, most notably an overall increase in meme coin investment and attention, as well as words from Elon Musk. Musk then elaborated on why he has been a fan of DOGE for the past several years: “The reason I ended up sort of endorsing Dogecoin is that when I was walking around the factory at Tesla, some people asked me to support Doge,” he said. “Then, at SpaceX, some regular guys said, ‘Can you support Doge?' and I was like, ‘Doge is the people's crypto, so I will support it.'” With all of this in mind, DOGE has seen a market cap as high as $32 billion in 2024. Here are some of the companies that DOGE is larger than: Delta Airlines (DAL) HP (HPQ) Dollar Tree (DLTR) MicroStrategy (MSTR) eBay (EBAY) Fifth Third Bank (FITB) Pinterest (PINS) Roblox (RBLX) DraftKings (DKNG) Kellogg's (K) The list has some of the largest companies in the world, including banks. These companies have thousands of employees dedicated to delivering value; conversely, DOGE has had only 40 contributors since launch and is seen as mainly a meme. The story of DOGE serves as a testament to the degeneracy of the crypto community that can take a project that started as a joke and provides little value and make it into something larger than most companies in the world.

Musk was quick to dismiss the report in part, but he did seem to endorse the other half of what Reuters was saying -- the bit about the robotaxi. In a tweet following up on Reuters' article, Musk confirmed that Tesla will announce a new self-driving electric vehicle (EV), which he called his ""robotaxi,"" on Aug. 8. Tesla Robotaxi unveil on 8/8 Clearly, nothing's 100% clear right now. But the most likely scenario seems that Tesla has made robotaxis its new top priority, while pouring money into developing a cheap EV is now taking a back seat. In the middle of an EV price war, that seems a sound strategy that could preserve profit margins for Tesla. It's not a reason to sell Tesla stock. But it might be a reason to buy. "

64,TSLA,Tesla Shares Jump as Investors Buy Into Musk’s Robotaxi Hype,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-shares-jump-investors-buy-142905896.html,"(Bloomberg) -- When Elon Musk announced he’ll unveil a Tesla Inc. robotaxi in August, it was a clear attempt to arrest a spiral for the once high-flying carmaker. Most Read from Bloomberg Tesla shares already had been sinking before the company reported anemic quarterly delivery figures on April 2. Days later, Reuters reported the automaker was shelving plans for a cheaper electric vehicle, extending the tailspin. Musk’s vague denial didn’t do the trick — the stock closed last week as the worst performer in the S&P 500 this year. So the chief executive officer turned to his tried-and-true playbook: change the narrative by dangling a new product. The shares jumped in late trading on Friday and rose as much as 5% by 10 a.m. Monday in New York. Splashy events have long been part of Tesla’s strategy to generate buzz while spending next to nothing on traditional advertising. Musk has mastered the craft of keeping investors focused on the future instead of current pain points, though it usually takes years for Tesla put products that its CEO shows into production. As for robotaxis, Musk has failed to make good on more than a decade of predictions about autonomous vehicles. “Investors need to curb some of their enthusiasm with this stock and its various product announcements, as there tends to be a wide chasm between hype/speculation and reality,” Adam Crisafulli, the founder of analysis firm Vital Knowledge, said by email. “This seems to be an example of Tesla trying to distract from the current EV market conditions, which are very bleak at the moment.” Touting Autonomy When Tesla started work on the system it markets as Autopilot in 2013, Musk estimated it would be able to handle 90% of the miles customers drove within a few years. In 2016, Musk alluded to autonomy in a second iteration of his master plan for the company, and Tesla started selling a feature called Full Self-Driving, or FSD. Eight years later, the system still doesn’t measure up to its name. In 2019, Musk declared that 1 million Teslas would soon be on the road and fully capable of driving themselves. He first hinted at plans for a dedicated robotaxi three years later. A similar pattern has played out with other Tesla products. Take the Semi, which Tesla showed at its design studio near Los Angeles in 2017. Years later, the Semi is still only in pilot production. Same goes for the Cybertruck. In 2019, Chief Designer Franz von Holzhausen shattered the glass window of a stainless-steel prototype. Years later, the futuristic pickup can be spotted sparingly in cities like Austin and Los Angeles, but sales are so low that Tesla has yet to break out figures in its quarterly reports. ‘Stay Tuned’ Tesla has suggested that its next-generation vehicle platform will underpin both a cheaper car and the dedicated robotaxi, and the vehicles are expected to be similar: one will have a steering wheel, the other won’t. On Sunday morning, von Holzhausen drove his matte black Cybertruck to speak at the Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles, where he was surrounded by Tesla fans angling for selfies and autographs. When asked if Tesla’s $25,000 vehicle was canceled, deprioritized or delayed, he demurred. “I would just say, stay tuned,” von Holzhausen said. “Don’t always believe in what you read.” Tesla has rolled out the latest version of FSD in recent weeks to a growing number of consumers, some via free trials. On Friday, the company announced that customers had collectively driven more than 1 billion miles using the feature. “Because the FSD progress is so fast right now, I think Elon just said ‘Let’s focus on this and put the $25,000 car on the back burner,’” said Mike Moon, a Tesla shareholder who attended the EV event at the Petersen museum. Moon said that roughly 30% of his investment portfolio is Tesla stock and that he’s buying more shares. Essential Software The promise of full autonomy has long been a way Tesla has set itself apart from rivals. The company charges $12,000 for FSD in the US, a tidy sum that could offset some of its recent price-cutting — but only if Tesla can convince more customers the feature is worth it. “In order to maintain market leadership, Tesla needs both cheaper cars and full self-driving — but FSD is more important,” said Cole Wilcox, CEO of Longboard Asset Management. “Software and services is a much better business model than manufacturing.” This is something Musk has stated, as well. “That’s essential,” Musk said of solving self-driving in June 2022. “That’s really the difference between Tesla being worth a lot of money and being worth basically zero.” Whether investors are willing to buy into Musk’s latest moonshot will be clearer in the weeks to come, with Tesla slated to report first-quarter earnings on April 23. Crisafulli, of Vital Knowledge, said Tesla investors should take the robotaxi hype in stride. “On the one hand, it implies the existence of a fully autonomous driving system, which could be a very lucrative new revenue stream,” Crisafulli said. “But so far, such a system doesn’t exist.” (Updates share trading in the third paragraph.)

65,TSLA,"US STOCKS-S&P 500, Nasdaq choppy as higher bond yields weigh",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-stocks-p-500-nasdaq-141459549.html,"(For a Reuters live blog on U.S., UK and European stock markets, click or type LIVE/ in a news window.) * Tesla gains after Musk says will unveil Robotaxi in August * Crypto stocks rise, tracking higher bitcoin prices * Indexes up: Dow 0.19%, S&P 0.02%, Nasdaq 0.09% (Updated at 9:49 a.m. ET/ 1349 GMT) By Shashwat Chauhan and Shristi Achar A April 8 (Reuters) - The benchmark S&P 500 and the Nasdaq struggled for direction in early trading on Monday after Treasury yields gained on rising bets that the U.S. Federal Reserve could delay interest-rate cuts this year. Hawkish commentary from central bank officials last week and stronger-than-expected manufacturing and jobs reports pointed to a resilient U.S. economy, easing the pressure on the Fed to cut interest rates quickly. U.S. stocks recorded weekly losses on Friday as traders scaled back expectations on the timing of rate cuts. They now see an around 51% chance of the Fed announcing its first rate cut in June, according to the CME FedWatch Tool, down from about 58% at the beginning of last week. The market has also pared back expectations of more than three rate cuts this year, from between three and four a few weeks ago, according to LSEG data. ""A lot of people are trying to be overly optimistic with a Fed rate cut. It kind of doesn't make sense,"" said Michael Matousek, head trader at U.S. Global Investors Inc. ""We've seen economic numbers over the past few weeks. It's not hot but it's still running strong. So why would you really want to cut rates?"" The yield on 10-year Treasury notes rose to its highest level since last November earlier in the session, pressuring equities, and was last at 4.417%. Market focus now shifts to the March reading of the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI), due later in the week, that is expected to show a rise in headline inflation to 3.4% year-on-year, from 3.2% in February. Also on the radar is the release of minutes from the Fed's latest meeting, where it stuck to its guidance of three rate cuts in 2024. Investors await commentary from Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee and his Minneapolis counterpart Neel Kashkari later in the day for policy cues. Meanwhile, Wells Fargo raised its year-end target for the benchmark S&P 500 index to 5,535 - the highest among Wall Street brokerages - from its previous forecast of 4,625​. Cushioning some losses, Tesla rose 4.6% after CEO Elon Musk said the company would unveil the Robotaxi on Aug. 8. At 9:49 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 72.78 points, or 0.19%, at 38,976.82, the S&P 500 was up 0.83 points, or 0.02%, at 5,205.17, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 14.24 points, or 0.09%, at 16,262.76. Eight of the 11 S&P 500 sectors advanced, with consumer discretionary leading gains, while information technology led declines. Cryptocurrency-related stocks advanced, tracking rising bitcoin prices. Exchange operator Coinbase Global, crypto miner Marathon Digital and software firm MicroStrategy added between 8.2% and 11.2%. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2.60-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 1.74-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&P index recorded 15 new 52-week highs and one new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 46 new highs and 33 new lows.

68,TSLA,Tesla heads to court after Apple engineer’s family says Autopilot caused his fatal crash,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-heads-court-apple-engineer-135625771.html,"Tesla and its controversial automated-driving system are on trial starting this week. Jury selection is set to begin Monday in a high-profile wrongful death suit filed by the family of a former Apple engineer who died after his Tesla Model X crashed while the Autopilot feature was engaged. The trial could last several weeks. Immediately following the December NHTSA report, Tesla recalled all 2 million of its cars in the United States, giving drivers more warnings when Autopilot is engaged and they are not paying attention to the road or placing their hands on the wheel. Yet the company maintains that the technology is safe to use when used correctly and reduces fatalities. Autopilot requires drivers to keep their hands on the wheel and Tesla says people who use the automated-driving technology should keep their eyes on the road. Although Huang’s family acknowledges he was distracted while the car was driving, they argue Tesla is at fault because it falsely marketed Autopilot as self-driving software. They allege Tesla knew that Autopilot was not ready for prime time and had flaws that could make its use unsafe. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. “Mrs. Huang lost her husband, and two children lost their father because Tesla is beta testing its Autopilot software on live drivers,” said B. Mark Fong, the lawyer who brought the suit filed in California state court in a May 2019 complaint. If the jury finds in favor of Huang’s family, Tesla could have to pay damages, and they could add up quickly. Wrongful death suits involving big companies have at times resulted in awards north of $1 billion. Autopilot’s promise has also helped to boost Tesla’s stock in recent years to make it the most valuable automaker in the world — even as its stock is among the worst-performers in 2024. Musk in October 2023 on a call with analysts aid autonomous driving “has the potential to make Tesla the most valuable company in the world by far.” "

Skepticism among investors is rising as EV startups tread on thin financial ice, facing the make-or-break challenge of proving their mettle in a fiercely competitive market. The industry’s capital-intensive nature is fast depleting the cash reserves of startups. Last week, Canoo released its quarterly results and concurrently expressed doubts about its ability to continue as a going concern. The following day, Canoo revealed a significant development by securing a vehicle sales agreement with Jazeera Paints. The agreement entails the initial purchase of 20 Canoo EVs, with an option to expand the fleet by an additional 180 vehicles potentially. Lucid Motors announced that it is raising another $1 billion from Saudi Arabia amid diminishing cash reserves. According to Peter Rawlinson, CEO of Lucid, the automaker is burning around $1 billion in cash per quarter. That makes us wonder if funding of $1 billion would prove to be sufficient for a company that is currently burning the same amount per quarter. Another EV startup, Fisker, has withdrawn its guidance for 2024 as it is evaluating strategic alternatives to keep itself afloat. The company, which has filed for bankruptcy, is also facing an NHTSA probe now. The following table shows the price movement of some of the major EV players over the last week and six-month period. Stay tuned for announcements of upcoming EV models and any important updates from the red-hot industry. "

They now see an around 51% chance of the Fed announcing its first rate cut this year in June, according to the CME FedWatch Tool, down from about 58% at the beginning of last week. The market has also pared back expectations for more than three rate cuts this year, from three to four a few weeks ago, according to LSEG data. ""A lot of people are trying to be overly optimistic with a Fed rate cut. It kind of doesn't make sense,"" said Michael Matousek, head trader at U.S. Global Investors Inc. ""We've seen economic numbers over the past few weeks. It's not hot but it's still running strong. So why would you really want to cut rates?"" The yield on 10-year Treasury notes rose 4.4561%, the highest level since last November, putting equities under pressure. Investors will await commentary from Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee and his Minneapolis counterpart Neel Kashkari later in the day for further policy cues. The focus will also be on the March reading of the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI), due later in the week, that is expected to show a rise in headline inflation to 3.4% year-on-year, from 3.2% in February. Also on the radar is the release of minutes from the Fed's latest meeting, in which it stuck to its guidance of three rate cuts this year. First-quarter earnings season picks up pace now, with banking giants JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo scheduled to report towards the end of the week. Meanwhile, Wells Fargo raised its year-end target for the benchmark S&P 500 index to 5,535 - the highest among Wall Street brokerages - from its previous forecast of 4,625​. At 8:42 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 41 points, or 0.10%, S&P 500 e-minis were up 7 points, or 0.13%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 34.5 points, or 0.19%. Some megacap growth stocks rose in premarket trading, with Amazon.com, Nvidia and Meta Platforms up between 0.2% and 1.4%. Tesla rose 2.5% in trading before the bell after CEO Elon Musk said the company would unveil the Robotaxi on Aug. 8. Cryptocurrency and blockchain-related stocks advanced, tracking rising bitcoin prices. Exchange operator Coinbase Global, crypto miner Marathon Digital and software firm MicroStrategy added between 5.4% and 6.6%. U.S.-listed shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) gained 2.3% after the U.S. Commerce Department said it would award the company's U.S. unit a $6.6 billion subsidy for advanced semiconductor production in Phoenix, Arizona.

74,TSLA,"Investors Heavily Search Tesla, Inc. (TSLA): Here is What You Need to Know",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-tesla-inc-130014924.html,"Over the past month, shares of this electric car maker have returned -6%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.6% change. During this period, the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, which Tesla falls in, has lost 5.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction? Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision. Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock. Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements. For the current quarter, Tesla is expected to post earnings of $0.57 per share, indicating a change of -32.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -8.4% over the last 30 days. The consensus earnings estimate of $2.94 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -5.8%. This estimate has changed -6.4% over the last 30 days. For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.78 indicates a change of +28.4% from what Tesla is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -7.7%. With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) for Tesla. The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate: Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial. For Tesla, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $23.97 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +2.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $108.97 billion and $128.18 billion estimates indicate +12.6% and +17.6% changes, respectively. Tesla reported revenues of $25.17 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3.5%. EPS of $0.71 for the same period compares with $1.19 a year ago. Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $25.94 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -2.97%. The EPS surprise was -5.33%. Over the last four quarters, Tesla surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period. No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance. Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is. As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued. Tesla is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade. The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Tesla. However, its Zacks Rank #5 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term. "

Hawkish commentary from Fed officials throughout last week and stronger-than-expected manufacturing and jobs reports pointed to a resilient U.S. economy, taking the pressure off the Fed to cut interest rates quickly. U.S. stocks recorded weekly losses on Friday as traders scaled back expectations of the central bank cutting rates in June. They now see an about 51% chance of the first rate cut in June, according to the CME FedWatch Tool, down from about 58% at the beginning of last week. The market has also pared back expectations for more than three rate cuts this year, from three to four a few weeks ago, according to LSEG data. The yield on 10-year notes rose 4.4541%, its highest level since last November, pressuring equities. ""While one should not attach too much importance to one payroll report, particularly when the seasonal effects are large, and there is still a lot of data to come between now and the June meeting,"" Mohit Kumar, chief economist Europe at Jefferies, said in a note. ""If the data remains robust we will have to rethink our June call."" Investors will await comments from Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee and his Minneapolis counterpart Neel Kashkari later in the day for further policy directions. The focus will also be on the March reading of the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI), due later in the week, that is expected to show a rise in headline inflation to 3.4% year-on-year, from 3.2% in February. Also on the radar is the release of minutes from the Fed's latest meeting, where it stuck to its guidance of three rate cuts this year. First-quarter earnings' season will pick up pace this week, with banking giants JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo scheduled to report towards the end of the week. Asset manager BlackRock and Delta Air Lines will also report their quarterly numbers this week. Meanwhile, Wells Fargo raised its year-end target for the benchmark S&P 500 index to 5,535 - the highest among Wall Street brokerages - from a prior forecast of 4,625​. At 7:25 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 11 points, or 0.03%, S&P 500 e-minis were up 0.75 points, or 0.01%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 12.75 points, or 0.07%. Tesla rose 1.9% in trading before the bell after CEO Elon Musk said the company would unveil the Robotaxi on Aug. 8. Cryptocurrency and blockchain-related stocks advanced, tracking rising bitcoin prices. Exchange operator Coinbase Global, crypto miner Marathon Digital and software firm MicroStrategy added between 6.1% and 11.6%.

78,TSLA,"Stock Market Today: Stocks mixed with inflation data, earnings ahead; Tesla leaps",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-market-today-stocks-higher-110720226.html,"U.S. stocks steadied in early Monday trading, while Treasury bond yields jumped to the highest levels in more than four months, as investors looked to navigate a challenging week on Wall Street that includes key inflation data and the start of the first quarter earnings season. The New York Fed's benchmark survey of consumer expectations for the month of March, published Monday, showed Americans expected year-ahead price increases of around 3%, unchanged from its last polling in February. At the same time, consumers said the chances of them missing an near-term debt payment rose to the highest levels in four years, suggesting a run-down in pandemic era savings and broader concerns over the impact of faster inflation. Stocks are off to a muted start to the week, with the S&P 500 slipping 1 point in the opening minutes of trading and the Nasdaq down 5 points. The Dow, meanwhile, has added around 67 points. Wells Fargo lifted its Uber price target by $5, to $95 per share, adding that it expects solid first quarter earnings, as well as a robust outlook,  when the group reports on May 7. Uber shares were marked 0.21% lower in at $77.00 each in pre-market trading. While no timeframe was discussed, JPMorgan noted that the board is ""spending significant time on developing operating committee members who are well-known to shareholders as strong potential CEO candidates"", with current COO Daniel Pinto tabbed as ""a key executive who is immediately ready to fulfill the responsibilities of the CEO"" should the need arise. Dimon, who has lead the biggest U.S. bank since 2006, underwent emergency heart surgery in 2020 and has been linked to senior roles in government, as well as candidate for the Presidency, over the past five years. JPMorgan shares were marked 0.18% higher in pre-market trading to indicate an opening bell price of $197.80 each. Stocks rallied hard on Friday, lifting the S&P 500 more than 57 points on the session to take the benchmark's year-to-date gain past 9.1%. The market move followed a stronger-than-expected March payrolls report that showed solid hiring with wage gains that were largely in line with Wall Street forecasts. However, when set against the recent ""higher for longer"" messaging from Federal Reserve officials, the report has kept market bets for a June rate cut muted at around 46.1%, some 10 percentage points below month-ago levels, according to CME Group data. Treasury bond yields were also moving higher Friday but failed to halt the afternoon rally on Wall Street, as traders adjusted their near-term rate and growth forecasts. Wednesday's inflation report will provide details as to how, and to what extent, wages and other pressures are driving price pressures. Economists are looking for a modest easing in the closely tracked core CPI reading, which was last pegged at 3.8%. Tom Williams/Getty Images Benchmark 10-year Treasury note yields added another 4 basis points in overnight trading to change hands at 4.441% heading into the start of the New York session, while 2-year notes were pegged 3 basis points higher at 4.781%. The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six global currencies, was marked 0.07% higher at 104.366. Apart from Wednesday's CPI report, as well as a reading on factory gate inflation the following day, investors are also braced for the start of the first quarter earnings season, with around nine S&P 500 companies set to report this week. Analysts see collective S&P 500 profits rising by 5% from a last year to a share-weighted total of $457.4 billion, a figure is expected to improve to around $494.1 billon over the three months ending in June. Heading into the start of the trading day on Wall Street, futures contracts tied to the S&P 500 are indicating a 1 point opening bell bump, while those linked to the Dow Jones Industrial Average suggest a 22 point advance. The tech-focused Nasdaq, which is up 8.24% for the year, is priced for an 11 point gain. In overseas markets, Europe's Stoxx 600 was marked 0.22% higher in early Frankfurt trading, with investors eyeing the European Central Bank's April policy meeting later this week, while Britain's FTSE 100 added 0.12% in London. Overnight in Asia, a weaker yen, tied in part to muted economic outlook data, helped the Nikkei 225 rise 0.91% in Tokyo while the regionwide MSCI ex-Japan index rose 0.16% into the close of trading.

82,TSLA,US STOCKS-Futures muted as bond yields rise,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-stocks-futures-muted-bond-102319054.html,"(For a Reuters live blog on U.S., UK and European stock markets, click or type LIVE/ in a news window.) * Futures down: Dow 0.05%, S&P 0.09%, Nasdaq 0.05% April 8 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures were flat on Monday as Treasury yields rose on rising bets that the U.S. Federal Reserve could delay interest rate cuts this year. Hawkish commentary from Fed officials throughout last week and stronger-than-expected manufacturing and jobs reports pointed to a resilient U.S. economy, taking pressure off the Fed to cut interest rates quickly. Wall Street's main indexes recorded weekly losses on Friday as traders scaled back expectations of the Fed cutting rates in June. They now see a 48% chance of the first rate cut in June, as per the CME FedWatch Tool, down from about 58% seen at the start of last week. The market has also pared back expectations for rate cuts to fewer than three this year, from three to four a few weeks ago, according to LSEG data. The yield on 10-year notes rose 4.45% to its highest level since November, pressuring equities. Investors will be watching for comments from Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee and his Minneapolis counterpart Neel Kashkari later in the day. The focus will also be on the March reading of U.S. consumer price inflation (CPI), due later in the week, that is expected to show a rise in headline inflation to 3.4% year-on-year from 3.2% in Feb. Also on the radar would be the release of minutes from the Fed's latest meeting, where it stuck to its guidance of three rate cuts this year. First-quarter earnings season will pick up pace this week, with banking giants JPMorgan Chase & Co, Citigroup and Wells Fargo & Co scheduled to report in the back-end of the week. Asset manager BlackRock and Delta Air Lines will also report their quarterly numbers this week. At 5:38 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were down 19 points, or 0.05%, S&P 500 e-minis were down 4.75 points, or 0.09%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 9.25 points, or 0.05%. Tesla jumped 3.4% in trading before the bell after CEO Elon Musk said the company will unveil Robotaxi on Aug. 8. Cryptocurrency and blockchain-related stocks advanced tracking rising bitcoin prices. Exchange operator Coinbase Global, crypto miner Marathon Digital and software firm MicroStrategy added between 5.7% - 11.9%. U.S.-listed shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) gained 1.3% after the U.S. Commerce Department said it would award the company's U.S. unit a $6.6 billion subsidy for advanced semiconductor production in Phoenix, Arizona.

84,TSLA,Mark Zuckerberg overtakes ‘cage fight’ rival in rich list battle,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/musk-drops-behind-zuckerberg-billionaires-091603842.html,"Elon Musk’s wealth has dropped below that of Mark Zuckerberg for the first time since 2020 as Tesla’s stock tumbles. The electric car company chief’s net worth now stands at $181bn (£143bn), making him the world’s fourth richest person according to Bloomberg’s Billionaires Index. As recently as a month ago Mr Musk was the richest person in the world. However, his net worth has sunk on the back of Tesla’s falling share price. Mr Musk has lost an estimated $48.8bn so far this year as a result of the stock downturn. Conversely, the billionaires around him on the rich list have all made significant gains. Shares in Meta, which owns Facebook, have climbed more than 50pc so far this year, leading to an increase in Mr Zuckerberg’s fortune of $58.9bn since January. The Facebook boss accepted the challenge but the grudge match was ultimately called off after Mr Musk complained of an injury. Mr Zuckerberg later said “Elon isn’t serious” about the fight. The fortunes of all of the world’s richest people often fluctuates as most hold the majority of their wealth in stocks, which trade daily. At its peak in 2021, Mr Musk’s fortune was worth $340bn following a pandemic-fuelled rally in Tesla’s share price. As well as a significant holding in Tesla, Mr Musk also owns X, formerly Twitter, and around 42pc of SpaceX, which forms the bulk of his wealth. He also has smaller interests in brain chip company Neuralink and The Boring Company. News of the entrepreneur falling behind Mr Zuckerberg comes as Mr Musk clashed with judges in Brazil over demands that Twitter place restrictions on a number of accounts. Officials in Brazil have been cracking down on social media accounts that spread disinformation in the wake of riots on January 8, following the defeat of former president Jair Bolsonaro. However, Mr Musk accused Brazilian Supreme Court judge Alexander de Moraes of “brazenly and repeatedly” violating Brazil’s constitution with demands to block accounts. Judge de Moraes said Mr Musk should “refrain from disobeying judicial orders, including by reactivating an account that the Supreme Court ordered blocked”. Mr Musk said he would reactivate accounts that Brazilian officials had banned. "

87,TSLA,"Trending tickers: Bitcoin, Tesla, Microsoft and Boeing",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-tesla-microsoft-boeing-trending-tickers-082845948.html,"Spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) flows are anticipated to remain robust leading up to the Bitcoin halving, according to analysts. On-chain analytics firm Santiment said that Bitcoin ETF volume has not slowed down since the asset’s mid-March all-time high. “It is a likely foregone conclusion that high activity should continue leading up to the April halving, but it will be interesting to see whether a drop-off in ETF volume and on-chain volume will occur directly afterwards.” Shares in Elon Musk’s EV maker were almost 4% higher in premarket trading as the company drops prices in an attempt to clear out its biggest ever inventory stockpile. Tesla is offering the deals after producing 46,561 more vehicles than it delivered in the first quarter, adding more cars to inventory than ever before. Microsoft is setting up an artificial intelligence lab in London, in the latest boost to the city as an AI hub. The company said Microsoft AI London would help drive its work in advance “state-of-the-art language models” and in creating “world-class tooling for foundation models.” Companies such as OpenAI and Anthropic have also set up offices in London in recent months amid a race for AI talent. Microsoft said it would be “actively hiring” employees to work on the most “challenging AI questions of our time” in the coming weeks and months, although did not say how many jobs would be created. Boeing shares slipped in premarket trading as the company is yet again under the spotlight for safety concerns after an engine cover fell off during take-off in Denver, US. US airline regulators have launched an investigation after the part came off and struck the wing flap. Flight 3695 — with 135 passengers and six crew members aboard — rose to about 10,300ft (3,140 metres) before returning safely 25 minutes later to Denver. ""We apologise for the inconvenience of their delay, but place our highest priority on ultimate safety for our customers and employees,"" a statement said. Boeing is overhauling its leadership amid its most significant safety crisis in years, announcing sweeping changes that included the departure of its chief executive Dave Calhoun at the end of the year.

88,TSLA,Tesla Set to Recover Top Spot in Cathie Wood’s Flagship Fund,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-set-recover-top-spot-060749319.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc. is poised to recover its top position in Cathie Wood’s main fund as her firm buys the dip in shares of the electric-vehicle maker. Most Read from Bloomberg ARK Innovation ETF, an exchange-traded fund known as ARKK, bought more than 2.3 million shares of Elon Musk’s company since December, raising the total weight to about 9.6%, according to Ark’s daily trading data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s second only to the current top holding — Coinbase Global Inc.’s 9.86%. Before the current buying spree, ARK ETFs had sold Tesla shares for three consecutive quarters. The purchases in recent months have taken the fund’s total stake in the company to more than six million shares. Most of that buying has been done via flagship ARK Innovation ETF and has come at a time when Wall Street’s outlook on the company is darkening rapidly. Tesla, which rose 4.2% in premarket trading on Monday, has erased about a third of its market value this year compared to a 9% gain in the S&P 500 Index and a 7.6% advance for the Nasdaq 100 Index. The stock extended its downtrend in April after the company said the number of cars it sold in the first quarter missed expectations by a wide margin, sparking concerns about its revenues and earnings growth. The 12-month forward consensus profit estimate for Tesla has dropped about 30% over the past year compared to a rise of 11% in the same metric for the S&P 500 Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The EV maker’s consensus analyst rating is near its lowest score in more than two-and-a-half years. In a 2023 analysis, Ark estimated Tesla to reach $2,000 per share in 2027, with its bull and bear cases at $2,500 and $1,400 per share, respectively. It last closed below $167. Ark’s flagship fund has fallen 10% this year. --With assistance from Subrat Patnaik. (Updates with premarket stock move in paragraph four.) Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek ©2024 Bloomberg L.P.

Andi, the joint venture between DiDi Autonomous Driving and GAC Aion, will roll out a crossover electric sports utility vehicle (SUV) as its inaugural model and will produce the first batch in 2025, the company said in a statement on Sunday. ""The joint venture has positioned us as a pioneer in the autonomous driving industry, enabling us to lead the creation of an early L4 commercial route and the world's initial closed-loop business model for L4 development that encompasses technology, smart manufacturing and operations,"" said Zhang Xiong, deputy general manager of GAC Aion. The company did not specify which authority issued the license. The Andi joint venture was set up last year. Didi's self-driving technology arm Didi Autonomous Driving also got funding of about $149 million from two investors including GAC Group's wholly-owned subsidiary GAC Capital Co. Tesla will unveil its robotaxi in August, CEO Elon Musk said last week after Reuters reported the EV maker dropped plans to make an inexpensive car and instead would develop self-driving robotaxis on the same small-vehicle platform. (This story has been corrected to clarify that the JV plans to produce, not sell, the first batch of robotaxis next year, in paragraph 1.

Andi, the joint venture between DiDi Autonomous Driving and GAC Aion, will roll out a crossover electric sports utility vehicle (SUV) as its inaugural model and will produce the first batch in 2025, the company said in a statement on Sunday. ""The joint venture has positioned us as a pioneer in the autonomous driving industry, enabling us to lead the creation of an early L4 commercial route and the world's initial closed-loop business model for L4 development that encompasses technology, smart manufacturing and operations,"" said Zhang Xiong, deputy general manager of GAC Aion. The company did not specify which authority issued the license. The Andi joint venture was set up last year. Didi's self-driving technology arm Didi Autonomous Driving also got funding of about $149 million from two investors including GAC Group's wholly-owned subsidiary GAC Capital Co. Tesla will unveil its robotaxi in August, CEO Elon Musk said last week after Reuters reported the EV maker dropped plans to make an inexpensive car and instead would develop self-driving robotaxis on the same small-vehicle platform.

93,TSLA,Brazilian judge opens investigation into Elon Musk after billionaire calls for his ouster over censorship,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/elon-musk-calls-ouster-brazil-225704169.html,"""He should resign or be impeached,"" Musk said. Musk’s attacks against the judge started Saturday evening after Moraes threatened to ""cut off access"" to the platform, which Musk purchased in 2022. Musk warned that ""we will probably lose all revenue in Brazil and have to shut down our office there."" ""But principles matter more than profit,"" he said. Moraes, one of 11 members of Brazil’s high court and presiding over the country’s Superior Electoral Tribunal (TSE), has been a divisive figure. His critics, Musk included, have accused Moraes of cracking down on free speech in Brazil after he ordered accounts of influential figures – many of whom supported former President Jair Bolsonaro – to be blocked. The former president was declared ineligible to run for office by the Moraes-led TSE for allegedly spreading disinformation about the country’s electoral system. In his inquiry, Moraes said X ""shall refrain from disobeying any court order already issued, including performing any profile reactivation that has been blocked by this Supreme Court."" If X fails to comply with the order to block certain accounts, the company will be fined the equivalent of $19,740 a day, the judge said. FOX Business reached out to Moraes for a response but did not hear back before publication. "

95,TSLA,Elon Musk’s leadership beginning to splinter Tesla loyalists as car sales drop: ‘He needs to focus and not be complaining or ranting about borders’,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/elon-musk-leadership-beginning-splinter-083000352.html,"“It’s very important to get that comp plan up and running because that is what keeps him focused,” complained Henning Schulze, now “significantly” underwater on his investment after three years. “Still believing in Elon, don’t get me wrong,” the IT professional told other Tesla investors in a Spaces forum held immediately after this week’s disastrous Q1 volumes, but “he needs to focus and not be complaining or ranting about borders.” Many Tesla veterans distrust mainstream media, believing coverage has been consistently unfair, and suspect much is due to rival automakers buying negative headlines with their advertising dollars. Those who do respond tend to already be disillusioned. And while some have been critical of his brand of divisive politics, their complaints focused on Musk’s lackluster enthusiasm as Tesla CEO, which they feel too few are willing to call out. Twitter once served as a useful mechanism to provide quick feedback to Musk from the community, but now some believe the Tesla CEO has let his popularity on the platform go to his head. Some Tesla “fans” are now doing some things that are petty and potentially even illegal that affect my life directly - simply because they disagree with what I write. This is a new low and it won’t work. They are messing with the wrong person. I’ve been sued before, I had… “The feedback loop is completely broken and now Elon is basking in the praise of his super fans while branding all legitimate criticism as attacks,” says Fred Lambert, who has previously spoken about mistakenly putting Musk on a pedestal. “He was always in it for himself,” Lambert wrote at the time, adding “This is not the man I used to consider my hero.” Tesla Robotaxi unveil on 8/8 Lambert is indicative of a growing schism in the community. While most don’t care how Musk splits his time since they support the man first—and the company second—an increasingly vocal minority want to see Musk commit himself fully to Tesla’s original mission to decarbonize transport, fearing that this plan has been forgotten as the CEO pivots to robotics and AI—when he isn't posting his thoughts on X. YouTuber Lee of New Zealand has published over 900 videos devoted to the company under the Tesla Economist account. Perhaps the biggest disappointment, however, has been the painfully slow progress made with Tesla’s vaunted next-generation 4680 cells and its related failure to reach scale with its innovative dry battery electrode coating, a game changer in terms of capital expenditure and manufacturing cost. “The company itself has been going downhill ever since,” he says. Musk still hasn’t delivered on the second part of his Master Plan, and yet he is already predicting Tesla's future lies in robotics. “I believe he saw this coming and dumped his stock early as a result” Lee says. Much like his promotion of the Shiba Inu-themed digital token, he suspects a lot of Musk’s broken promises were little more than an attempt to pump the stock to meet the milestone targets of his mammoth (and now void) pay package. My take: I had been warning everyone since last year how bad Q1 was looking. As Q1 is always the worst performing Q. Although I didn't expect it quite this bad. It is clearly demand related, whether too much competition, dated Tesla designs, EV market growth slowing, or maybe… “It would appear the fate of the company is down to FSD,” said the Tesla content creator, “and it’s up to you how likely you think that will occur and how much it would be worth” This month’s move to drop the “beta” qualifier in front of FSD in favor of “supervised” is seen by many as an attempt to claim testing and validation of the software is over so that it can recognize a chunk of the $926 million in deferred revenue to rescue what will surely be an otherwise challenging Q1 for profits. Ross Gerber, a co-founder of asset manager Gerber Kawasaki, has long been a vociferous supporter of Tesla. Yet like many fans of the company’s original mission, he is critical of the debt-funded Twitter acquisition that has sucked up so much of Musk's time. His reward for stepping out of line is a stream of abuse from Elon superfans. The tycoon’s moodiness and volatility, for which he is on a ketamine prescription, were less of an issue so long as Tesla’s unflappable finance chief, Zach Kirkhorn, was at his side. For now, the various factions are struggling to unite around a common direction for the company: should it stick to freeing the world from the clutches of the fossil fuel industry that’s destroying the planet—or build a robot for every man, woman and child? Echo chamber warning. “Elon Musk is the most important asset Tesla has,” he told Schulze and others in the forum. “And we’re in danger of losing him, in part because a lot of the sentiment of shareholders who say we should just kick the guy out, we should just fire him.” “That’s my litmus test to determine whether someone is a fan of Tesla or Elon—do they believe deserves a full-time CEO?” Lambert says. “But if he cannot snap out of this broken feedback loop, I just cannot see him having a more positive than negative impact going forward.” "

97,TSLA,What’s wrong with Tesla?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wrong-tesla-070026064.html,"Last quarter, Tesla posted its first annual sales decline since the pandemic — a drop that was significantly worse than expected. The company blamed a weak Chinese economy, arson at its German factory and supply constraints because of escalating conflict in the Middle East. Those factors certainly aren’t helping. But Tesla’s problems can’t all be blamed on outside factors. Some of it is inevitable. New competitors have entered the market and, at some point, they had to start taking sales away from Tesla. And now they are. Tesla made itself an easy target by failing to introduce new products fast enough to maintain customer interest. Also, its chief executive, Elon Musk, has become someone many people don’t want to associate themselves with, even for a good car. Meanwhile, overall electric vehicle sales in the United States have flattened out in recent months. EV sales growth has been slowing for a while but in the last two quarters, EV sales didn’t increase much at all, according to estimates from Cox Automotive. But, upon closer inspection, what seems like widespread disinterest in electric vehicles may reflect, largely, less interest in Tesla. Some automakers, including Audi, BMW, Mercedes and Rivian, are reporting EV sales growth of more than 50% over the past year, noted Stephanie Valdez Streaty, an analyst with Cox Automotive, in a presentation summarizing industry trends in the new year. Ford later said its EV sales were up 86%. “Looking at the data, the big [EV] slowdown is shaping up to be a Tesla slowdown,” said Valdez Streaty. Tesla’s stock price has dropped by nearly a third in 2024 as the company’s sales numbers and profits have disappointed. It’s been one of the worst performers in the S&P 500 so far this year. As it turned out, sales haven’t grown at all in 2024. Instead, Tesla’s global first-quarter sales plunged more than 20% from the same time last year, marking the first time since the covid pandemic that sales have gone down over a year. Tesla wasn’t just a victim of a general slow-down in EV interest, though. In the United States, Teslas still made up about 56% of all electric vehicles sold in 2023. While that’s much less than the roughly 80% of EV sales Tesla accounted for in 2019, according to Edmunds.com, it’s still a majority. When Americans lose interest in Teslas, it can look like an overall lack of interest in electric vehicles. Between the first quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024, US electric vehicle sales grew an estimated 15%, according to a recent report by Cox Automotive. But, if you leave out Tesla, sales of other electric vehicles, as a group, were up 33%. The Tesla Model 3 and Model Y, its most popular models by far, are seven and five years old, respectively. Other automakers, like Ford, Audi, and Hyundai, offer competitive EV models that are much newer to the market. “The two core Tesla products are excellent vehicles, but the auto industry revolves around ‘new’ models and fresher alternatives from competitors are likely slowing Tesla demand,” Valdez Streaty said in an email to CNN. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment on the age of the company’s vehicle line-up. The Tesla Cybertruck is new and garnering a lot of attention but it’s only just come out and, so far, is produced and sold in low numbers. Tesla is also rolling out an updated version of the Model 3 — although it remains, fundamentally, the same car. Tesla’s chief executive, Elon Musk, could also be causing problems for the brand with his increasingly controversial public pronouncements. While Caliber’s data doesn’t make firm connections to specific causes, the company’s reseach also uncovered low opinions of Musk, himself. Musk and Tesla are, by far, much more closely connected in public perception than most CEOs and the companies they run, said Søren Holm, head of client services for Caliber. “He could, perhaps, not be more of a bright star at the top of Tesla than he is. He’s a man of the year, he’s the richest person alive. Just heralded everywhere,” he said in an interview with CNN. “And then he’s using all of this otherwise positive attention to create some negative attention around himself.” Tesla did not respond to a request for comment on the impact of Musk’s statements. “He’s beginning to get this reputation of being a very kind of loose gun,” Holm said. As competing models hit the market that are similar in price, quality and performance to those Tesla offers, the public image baggage Musk adds to the brand could dissuade shoppers, Holm said. “That’s something where the reputation a CEO imprints on a company’s brand and expression is carrying a lot of weight,” he said.

98,TSLA,Wall Street Analysts Just Trimmed Price Targets for These 10 Stocks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-analysts-just-trimmed-004244986.html,"On April 2, Jefferies revised down its price target for EQT Corporation (NYSE:EQT) from $50 to $42 while maintaining a Buy rating on the stock. The adjustment in the price target came in response to EQT Corporation (NYSE:EQT) recent announcement regarding its acquisition of Equitrans Midstream (ETRN). Despite maintaining a positive outlook on EQT Corporation (NYSE:EQT) prospects, Jefferies observed a negative market reaction following the acquisition news. According to Jefferies, the market's apprehension primarily stemmed from several factors associated with the vertical merger. These concerns include the unexpected nature of the merger, heightened leverage and debt reduction timing risks, increased complexity in operations, and the likelihood of undergoing review by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). While Jefferies acknowledges the potential benefits of the acquisition, such as an improved cost structure and reduced earnings volatility, they emphasize the importance of deleveraging as a crucial initial step. However, given the intricacies involved in the merger, investors may adopt a cautious stance and await further clarity on how the integration process unfolds. The decision to lower the price target underscores Jefferies' assessment of the near-term challenges and uncertainties associated with EQT Corporation (NYSE:EQT) strategic move. Despite the downward adjustment, Jefferies maintains a Buy rating on EQT Corporation (NYSE:EQT) shares, indicating their belief in the company's long-term growth prospects once the complexities surrounding the acquisition are addressed and its benefits realized. In line with the recent trend of analysts revising price targets for major companies like Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), and FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX), EQT Corporation (NYSE:EQT) has also seen a downward adjustment in its price target. On April 2, Evercore ISI adjusted down its price target for Casey's General Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ:CASY) to $342 from $345 while maintaining an Outperform rating on the stock. The decision to revise the price target followed Casey's General Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ:CASY) Q3 earnings report, which showed robust top-line growth, favorable traffic trends, and expansion in inside store margins. Evercore ISI noted that despite the positive operational performance, they made slight adjustments to their fuel profit estimates, which influenced the revised price target. The firm emphasized the potential for Casey's General Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ:CASY) to gain market share, explore merger and acquisition opportunities, and leverage pricing strategies in its prepared meals segment, factors contributing to their optimistic outlook on the stock. In the retail industry, particularly in convenience stores and fuel retailing, Casey's General Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ:CASY) General Stores holds a prominent position. Evercore ISI's assessment reflects confidence in Casey's General Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ:CASY) ability to capitalize on its strengths and strategic opportunities to drive future growth. While the price target adjustment may signal short-term considerations, Evercore ISI's continued Outperform rating indicates their belief in Casey's long-term potential. The firm's analysis suggests that despite the slight revision, Casey's General Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ:CASY) remains well-positioned to deliver value to investors through its operational excellence and growth initiatives in the convenience store sector. On April 2, Barclays analyst Julian Mitchell revised down the price target for Rockwell Automation, Inc. (NYSE:ROK) from $269.00 to $265.00, maintaining an underweight rating on the stock. This adjustment followed a thorough assessment of Rockwell Automation, Inc. (NYSE:ROK) performance and market conditions. Rockwell Automation, Inc. (NYSE:ROK) operates in the industrial automation and control systems industry, providing solutions for manufacturing and industrial processes. Mitchell's decision to lower the price target suggests a cautious outlook on the company's future prospects. The price target cut by Barclays reflects a downward revision in their valuation of Rockwell Automation, Inc. (NYSE:ROK) stock, indicating potential challenges or headwinds facing the company. Along with the negative 1.11% price reaction following the announcement, Mitchell's underweight rating implies a belief that Rockwell Automation, Inc. (NYSE:ROK) may underperform relative to its industry peers or broader market benchmarks. Amidst the adjustments to price targets for prominent companies such as Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), and FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX), analysts have similarly revised their price target for Zoetis Inc. (NYSE:ZTS). On April 2, Stifel analyst Jonathan Block adjusted the price target for Zoetis Inc. (NYSE:ZTS) downward from $215.00 to $195.00, while upholding a Buy rating on the stock. Zoetis Inc. (NYSE:ZTS) operates in the animal health industry, providing a wide range of veterinary products and services. The price reaction after the price target cut indicates a decrease of 1.20% compared to the current market price of $165.01 as of the closing bell on April 2. Despite this short-term negative market response, the Buy rating implies confidence in Zoetis Inc. (NYSE:ZTS) long-term potential. On April 2, RBC Capital analysts revised down their price target for 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) from $84 to $78, while maintaining an Underperform rating on the stock. This update comes after 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) healthcare business, Solventum, was spun off on April 1. For the initial quarter of 2024, 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) Health Care division will continue to be reflected in the company's financial reports. Key modifications in RBC's model involve excluding Health Care sales and profits from the second quarter of 2024, anticipating stranded costs of $150-$175 million annually across various segments, and projecting that Transition Service Agreement (TSA) income and expenses will balance each other out, resulting in a neutral overall impact. Operating in the manufacturing industry, 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) offers a diverse array of products and solutions. The negative 1.26% price reaction subsequent to the price target decrease suggests that investors may have recalibrated their expectations for 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) performance based on RBC Capital's analysis. Along with this negative short-term market response, the Underperform rating implies caution regarding 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) prospects. It underscores RBC Capital's reservations about 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) business model and future growth potential. Suggested articles: "

104,META,Meta Platforms Is Still Cheap Based on Its Powerful FCF,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-platforms-still-cheap-based-140002088.html,"This analysis will show how that works out, including a price target based on its FCF margins, analysts' revenue estimates and using a FCF yield metric to value the company. However, one of the best reasons that Meta is attracting value investors is its return of capital to shareholders. This dividend is easily affordable for the social media giant. It will cost only $5.10 billion annually (i.e., $2 dividend per share x 2.492 billion shares outstanding). That is only 10% or so of the estimated adjusted FCF of $48 billion this year. And since Meta also bought back almost $20 billion worth of its shares in the market last year, total returns to shareholders are now over $25 billion. That provides a good shareholder yield of 2%, of which 0.40% comes from the dividend and 1.60% is from buybacks. Source: Hake estimates So Meta's 2% shareholder yield, including its dividend and buybacks, looks reasonable and could even grow higher as its free cash flow rises. The company's basis metrics have been doing quite well. Monthly average users have climbed consistently in the last three years by 6.40% annually on a compound average growth rate basis. And this has led to a revenue CAGR of 16.20% in the last three years. In fact, the total Facebook plus Instagram and What's App MAU figures are now almost 4 billion as of fourth-quarter 2023. At this pace in the next years, its family or group of products MAU figures could reach almost 5 billion by sometime in mid-2026. And revenue, using a survey of 57 analysts, could rise 17.50% this year to $158.50 billion and 12.50% to $178 billion in 2025. That works out to a three-year CAGR of 10% this year and over 15% by the end of 2025. Moreover, last year, Meta Platforms generated $43 billion in free cash flow. That means this is the cash the company generated after all its operating cash expenses, including working capital changes and capital expenditure spending. The company calculates its free cash flow by deducting from operating cash flow both its capex spend as well as principal payments on its finance leases. This slightly lowers its FCF figures, but it provides a useful way to forecast the company's FCF going forward. In the past five years, Meta's revenue has almost doubled from $69.70 billion in 2019 to $134.90 billion in 2023. This has been driven by its consistent MAU growth. As a result, analysts now project revenue could rise by over 32%, or almost one-third, by the end of 2025. That will lead to much higher adjusted free cash flow, as seen in the chart below. This shows the company's adjusted free cash flow margins have now recovered from the post-Covid low of 15.80% in 2022 to almost 31.90% in 2023. Moreover, based on company guidance, it is likely its FCF margin will stay over 30% in both 2024 and 2025. For example, management told analysts in the earnings call that its capex spending will be in the range of $30 billion to $37 billion. So using a $35 billion estimate and also its operating cash flow margin of roughly 53%, its adjusted FCF will be $48 billion this year, up 11.60% from last year's $43 billion in adjusted free cash flow. This calculation can be seen in the table below. It is based on analysts' revenue forecasts, a 53% operating cash flow margin, a 30% increase in 2024 capex spending over 2023 (from $27 billion to $35 billion) and a deduction of lease principal payments. The net result is that by 2025 Meta may be generating $55 billion in adjusted FCF, a 28% rise over 2023. As a result of this strong FCF forecast, a much higher price target can be set. For example, assuming the company was to pay out 100% of its FCF as a dividend, its dividend yield is likely to be around 3%. This, in fact, is higher than its existing 2% shareholder yield, as shown earlier in this discussion, so it is a conservative estimate It is also the same as multiplying Meta's adjusted FCF by 33.30 times since 3% is the inverse of a 33.30 multiple. The table below shows how this works out. The bottom line is Meta stock could be worth $1.60 trillion by the end of 2024 and $1.83 trillion by 2025 using these metrics. That implies that currently the stock is at least 26% undervalued at the time of writing, compared to its $1.26 trillion market cap. The price target is about $627 per share this year and $719 next year. The bottom line is that Meta looks undervalued, given its consistent MAU and revenue growth, even after much capex spending is factored in. The company's powerful FCF is likely to continue to surprise the market and push its underlying value much higher. "

107,META,"Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-platforms-inc-meta-trending-130015062.html,"Over the past month, shares of this social media company have returned +4.2%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.6% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Software industry, which Meta Platforms falls in, has gained 4.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction? Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision. Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock. Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements. Meta Platforms is expected to post earnings of $4.27 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +61.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged. The consensus earnings estimate of $19.94 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +34.1%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $23.09 indicates a change of +15.8% from what Meta Platforms is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged. With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Meta Platforms. The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate: While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth. In the case of Meta Platforms, the consensus sales estimate of $36.07 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +25.9%. The $158.75 billion and $179.75 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +17.7% and +13.2%, respectively. Meta Platforms reported revenues of $40.11 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +24.7%. EPS of $5.33 for the same period compares with $3 a year ago. Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $38.99 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.87%. The EPS surprise was +10.35%. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period. Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects. Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is. The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued. Meta Platforms is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade. The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Meta Platforms. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term. "

This week, Tracey is joined by Bryan Hayes, Zacks Stock Strategist and editor of the Income Investor newsletter, to talk about how to create a stock portfolio that also generates on average of $100 a month, or $1200 a year. It doesn't sound like much, does it? Just $100 a month. But depending on the yield on each stock, it may take you a bigger investment than you think to get there. This podcast is talking about individual stocks, not dividend paying ETFs. With a diverse set of stocks, it's possible to generate $1200 a year and you may get the benefit of stock appreciation as well. Tracey and Bryan looked at 5 large cap stocks as larger companies are more likely to pay dividends, and to raise the dividend payout, consistently over time. Where should you look to generate $100 a month, or $1200 a year? VICI Properties owns 93 experiential properties including 54 gaming properties. It's holdings include sports and wellness including Bowlero, Canyon Ranch, Great Wolf Resorts, Kalahari Resorts, and Homefield. VICI also owns some of the most iconic names on the Las Vegas strip including Caesars Palace Las Vegas, MGM Grand and the Venetian Resort Las Vegas. VICI is a REIT and is currently paying an annual dividend of $1.66 per share, which is yielding 5.6%. If you owned only VICI, you would have to buy 722 shares at the cost of $21,267, to generate $1200 a year. Should VICI be on the short list for those looking for a REIT? KeyCorp is a regional bank headquartered in Cleveland, OH with a market cap of $14.3 billion. The banks have been battered over the last 2 years. Shares of KeyCorp have dropped about 30% during that time. But is a turnaround coming? KeyCorp is up 6% year-to-date. It pays an annual dividend of $0.82, which is yielding 5.3%. If you only bought KeyCorp, you would need to buy 1463 shares at the cost of $22,375 to generate the $1200 a year. Is a bank like KeyCorp a bargain right now? In Feb 2024, Meta Platforms announced its board of directors had authorized a quarterly dividend. This was a first for the social media company. Meta Platforms is now paying an annual dividend of $2.00 a share, which is a yield of just 0.4%. With a yield that low, it will take a lot of firepower to generate $1200 just from owning Meta Platforms. An investor would need 600 shares, at the cost of $296,412, to generate the $1200 payout. Should Meta Platforms still be a part of a passive income portfolio even with its low yield? ExxonMobil is one of the world's largest energy and chemical companies. It is a dividend aristocrat. It has raised its dividend every year for 41 years. ExxonMobil says its annual increase averages 5.8% over those 41 years. ExxonMobil is currently paying $3.80 for a yield of 3.3%. An investor would need to buy 315 shares for $37,443, to generate $1200 a year in passive income. ExxonMobil shares are up 18.6% year-to-date. Should energy stocks be in your passive income portfolio? Eli Lilly is a big pharmaceutical company that is producing a weight loss drug. Investors looking for passive income have historically looked to big pharma companies like Eli Lilly because they tend to pay them. However, Eli Lilly is not a member of the dividend aristocrats, because while it has paid a dividend for many years, from 2009-2014 it did not increase it. Eli Lilly is paying an annual dividend of $5.20 per share, for a yield of 0.7%. Shares have soared 165% over the last 2 years, pushing the yield down. Investors would have to buy 230 shares, at a cost of $175,346, to generate $1200 a year. Should Eli Lilly be part of a passive income portfolio? Tune into this week's video podcast to find out.

109,META,3 Supercharged Tech Stocks to Buy Without any Hesitation,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-supercharged-tech-stocks-buy-101500335.html,"Some already have shown their strength in recent times, advancing even after their top performances last year. So, just because a stock has gained in the double or even triple digits doesn't mean it's too late to buy that particular player. It's essential to take a look at the company's earnings track record, future prospects, and market position. Using these as a guide, investors can determine whether the stock has what it takes to generate more gains. These days, if a company has a strong presence in the high-growth area of artificial intelligence (AI), it scores extra points. (The AI market is expected to reach more than $1 trillion by the end of the decade.) Let's check out three supercharged tech stocks that easily pass this test, making them stocks to buy without any hesitation. Just recently, Nvidia announced much-anticipated news: It plans to release its new Blackwell architecture, which includes six technological innovations, later this year. Among these innovations are the world's most powerful chip and a second-generation transformer engine that will help Blackwell support double the computing power of its predecessors. The Blackwell platform also allows users to run generative AI at as much as 25 times lower cost and energy consumption compared to the previous platform. This has helped Meta grow revenue and profit, and the tech company reached a new level of strength recently, saying it's confident it can continue to grow and reward investors; so it launched its first dividend. Meta is going all in on AI. Eventually, users of its products and services can rely on AI tools there to enrich their experiences. With all of this in mind, Meta is dirt cheap for 25 times forward-earnings estimates. The e-commerce and cloud-computing giant struggled with higher inflation back in 2022 but quickly turned things around by revamping its cost structure -- a move that should help Amazon excel in any environment. Last year, Amazon's revenue climbed in the double digits, and it returned to profitability after a loss in 2022 -- the company's first net loss in almost a decade. Moving forward, Amazon should benefit from its dominance in the high-growth businesses of e-commerce and cloud computing, as well as its presence in AI. Amazon is using AI to improve its operations, leading to cost savings, and the company is selling AI products and services to clients through its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business. Both of these efforts should result in earnings growth in the near and long term. That's why Amazon doesn't look expensive today, trading at 42 times forward-earnings estimates. It's a stock I'd buy with no hesitation. Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this: "
110,META,"This ""Magnificent Seven"" Stock Just Hit an All-Time High and Could Soar a Lot More, According to 4 Wall Street Analysts",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/magnificent-seven-stock-just-hit-095000304.html,"It wasn't all that long ago that many investors had seemingly given up on Meta. In 2022, the company's earnings growth was anemic. Some viewed Facebook as yesterday's news with ByteDance's TikTok on the rise. Skepticism was high, to say the least, about CEO Mark Zuckerberg's big bet on building the metaverse. After an especially disappointing quarterly update in February 2022, Meta's share price plunged 26% in one day, wiping out $251 billion of the company's market cap. In the stock market's history, no company had lost that much value on a dollar basis in a single trading day. By November 2022, Meta's shares were down 75% below the previous high. That was then. Meta is now on a roll -- a huge one. Since bottoming out in late 2022, the social media stock has skyrocketed over 450%. Meta's shares are up close to 49% so far this year. Can Meta's major momentum continue? At least four analysts think so. While not quite as bullish about Meta as the other Wall Street pros, Jefferies analysts are decidedly enthusiastic about the stock. They wrote in a note to investors last week that ""Meta has too many advantages to count."" Wall Street pros don't know what the future holds any more than you or I do. It's possible that Meta won't come close to delivering the kind of gains analysts predict over the next 12 months. However, I think Wall Street's optimism about the stock is warranted over the long term. Facebook remains much more resilient than many might have expected a few years ago. The social media platform had 2.11 billion average daily active users in December 2023, up 6% year over year. Across all of Meta's platforms, the average daily active user count was 3.19 billion, an increase of 8% from the prior-year period. Meta continues to do a great job at monetizing this massive global audience. Ad impressions have risen. Facebook and Instagram Reels have become a key revenue source. Business messaging on WhatsApp is a big growth driver. The company is leveraging AI to help advertisers automate their ad campaigns. Zuckerberg thinks it's possible that smart glasses with built-in AI assistants could be a ""killer app."" He also reiterated that Meta plans to roll out functionality including holograms and a sense of presence for its smart glasses in the future. Meta intends to incorporate artificial general intelligence (AGI) into its products as well. In the company's Q4 earnings call, Zuckerberg said, ""We're going to need our models to be able to reason, plan, code, remember, and many other cognitive capabilities in order to provide the best versions of the services we envision."" I won't be surprised if Meta's shares pull back somewhat over the next year like some of its Magnificent Seven peers have. But I fully expect this stock to be a magnificent winner for investors over the next decade and beyond. Before you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this: "

113,META,2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks You Can Buy and Hold for the Next Decade,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-artificial-intelligence-ai-stocks-084500424.html,"For a long time, Microsoft had been known mainly for its Windows operating system and Microsoft Office productivity suite. However, besides its software dominance, the company is now also seen for its prowess in the generative AI field, thanks to its long-standing partnership with ChatGPT creator OpenAI. The second dominant player in the cloud infrastructure space, the Microsoft Azure cloud computing platform, continues to be a major beneficiary of increased enterprise spending on AI services. Azure's revenue was up 30% year over year, wherein 6% growth came from increasing adoption of AI services. Not surprisingly, Azure OpenAI Service is already being used by more than half of the Fortune 500 companies. Azure AI had 53,000 customers at the end of the second quarter fiscal 2024 (ending Dec. 31, 2023), which included both AI-first start-ups and large enterprises. Furthermore, Microsoft's focus on tailoring Azure solutions to the specific needs of multiple industries through industry clouds and cross-industry clouds is also driving usage. All these AI capabilities can eventually bring in significant revenue streams for Microsoft. Plus, the company is standing on solid financial ground, with $81 billion in cash at the end of the second quarter. Hence, considering Microsoft's sustained growth potential, this seems to be the right time for long-term investors to pick up at least a small stake in this AI stock. Shares of digital advertising giant Meta Platforms (and owner of social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger) surged 194% in 2023 and nearly 43% so far in 2024. Despite these gains, there are multiple reasons why the stock can prove to be a stellar investment in the coming decade. These recommendations are playing a pivotal role in increasing daily usage of its platforms among the younger population (age 18 to 29 ) in the U.S. This demographic is exceptionally important for the advertiser community, mainly due to its high lifetime value. Second, Meta is also focusing on unifying its AI-powered recommendation system across Meta's video ecosystem (short-form, long-form, and Reels). By leveraging a vast amount of data across video types, the company aims to recommend more relevant and responsive content to users, thereby enhancing user engagement. Improvements in AI technology will improve ad targeting and conversion rates, further bumping up ad revenue for Meta in the coming years. Third, Meta has also invested in AI tools and products (Advantage+ suite) to help advertisers automate the creation of advertisements. The company is also introducing generative AI features for content creators to boost user engagement. Fourth, these AI initiatives have helped expand Meta's user base and increase advertising revenue across geographies. In the fourth quarter of 2023 (ending Dec. 31, 2023), the company's monthly active user base was up 6% year over year to 3.98 billion people. Meta's ad revenue rose 24% year over year to $38.7 billion. With Meta's user base accounting for nearly half of the global population of 8 billion, the company is exceptionally positioned to capture an even bigger share of the global digital advertising market, which is estimated to grow from $363 billion in 2023 to $1.1 trillion in 2032. Considering these robust tailwinds, Meta can prove to be an attractive pick for long-term investors. "

115,META,"Following Its Highly Anticipated IPO, Reality May Already Be Setting in for Reddit Stock. 3 Things Smart Investors Should Know.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/following-highly-anticipated-ipo-reality-184000109.html,"Unsurprisingly, some businesses are taking advantage of the ripe market conditions as 2024 has featured a number of high-profile initial public offerings (IPO). Prospective Reddit investors should understand the major risk areas for the company and how they can affect its long-term outlook. This makes sense from a business perspective. If you can attract more users to your platform, then you have a bigger monetization opportunity. And the most common way to monetize users on social media is through advertising. With 73 million daily active users, Reddit clearly has some brand appeal. Moreover, in 2023, the company generated $804 million in revenue -- up 21% year over year. Similar to its competitors, Reddit's primary source of revenue stems from advertising. Meta Platforms owns Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp, which combine for over 3 billion daily active users. Meanwhile, Alphabet is home to the world's most visited websites -- Google and YouTube -- with over 100 billion site visits each month. But the company's plan to grow beyond the typical advertising business model is puzzling, and even more concerning, it's very much unproven. In Reddit's S-1 filing, the company describes two other areas it's exploring as revenue opportunities: e-commerce and artificial intelligence (AI). E-commerce can complement Reddit's existing advertising operation. However, the intersection of Reddit's specific brand of social media and e-commerce can be a challenge given existing players in the space. Meta has been able to penetrate e-commerce successfully thanks to the rise of small businesses on Instagram as well as the marketplace on Facebook. But while smaller platforms like Snap are also experimenting with e-commerce, their success has been much more limited. Average revenue per user has continued to trend lower for Snap, hinting at the challenges for social media companies looking to expand their sources of revenue. Given Reddit's vast library of user data, there is merit to the idea the platform's content can be scraped to help train generative AI models. However, the risk here is that those same models could eventually poach the company's user base and engagement as people turn to AI for the discussion and answers they previously sought on Reddit. Reddit has a market capitalization of $7.5 billion as of this writing, putting its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio at about 9.3. That matches Meta's P/S ratio, while coming in higher than the likes of Pinterest and Snap. This premium valuation is hard to justify given the question marks surrounding its growth prospects. Andrew Freedman, an analyst at Hedgeye Risk Management, recently called the stock ""grossly overvalued"" in a short report published last week, according to Bloomberg. Freedman believes the stock will retreat closer to its IPO price of $34 per share, which would benefit short sellers who profit when a stock's price falls. Once Reddit begins hosting earnings calls, investors will learn how much success the company is having with its pursuits in e-commerce and AI. But for now, I'd steer clear of Reddit and let the current hype surrounding the stock play out. There are other opportunities in social media from larger, more established businesses.

117,META,Will Visa Be a Trillion-Dollar Stock by 2035?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/visa-trillion-dollar-stock-2035-134400444.html,"If you want to find growth stocks that can keep growing faster and longer than anyone expects, look for companies that benefit from network effects. As Meta has proven, network effects can provide a reliable runway for growth. Growth, in many ways, begets more growth. Both Facebook and Instagram grow stronger the larger they get, attracting even more users while preventing competing platforms from catching up. Network effects simply put growth stocks like Meta on steroids. That's great news for Visa considering that it benefits from some of the strongest network effects of any publicly traded company today. You're likely familiar with Visa as a company. You may have a Visa credit or debit card within arm's reach right now. Why? Because you know it will be accepted by almost every merchant you're likely to patronize. Merchants, meanwhile, want to accept the forms of payment that most people prefer to use. As you can see, market share drops off quickly after Visa. And given an understanding of network effects, this makes total sense. It would be very difficult to start a new payments network that could rival Visa's. Somehow, that new competitor would need to convince millions of merchants to accept its form of payment even though no one currently uses it. Or, that company would need to convince millions of people to adopt their form of payment even though no merchants currently accept it. Visa has a terrific long-term track record, not because it has a super-innovative business model or a special patent, but because it benefits from strong and durable network effects. These are exactly the types of businesses you want to own long term. It's not hard to see Visa surpassing a $1 trillion market cap well before 2035. It took only a few years for the company to grow from a $250 billion valuation to a $500 billion valuation. The payments industry is truly gigantic, and with a hefty lead on the competition, Visa should have no problem growing from its $560 billion market cap today to a $1 trillion market cap by 2035. In truth, it should surpass that mark by 2030. All it needs to do is sustain its current growth rates, and durable network effects make that a reasonable expectation. Visa stock can look expensive. Shares, for example, are now priced at 31 times earnings. But keep in mind that the S&P 500 as a whole currently trades at 28 times earnings. Paying a bit extra for one of the market's highest-quality businesses shouldn't faze investors willing to hold the stock over the long term. Before you buy stock in Visa, consider this: "
118,META,3 No-Brainer Billionaire-Owned Stocks to Buy Right Now,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-no-brainer-billionaire-owned-110000833.html,"You generally don't want to mindlessly copy someone else's portfolio, because different strategies work better for different investors. Not everyone has the same investment style, risk tolerance, financial goals, or time horizon. That said, there is nothing wrong with looking to investors -- especially ones with proven success -- for investment ideas. Although Visa accounts for a small portion of Berkshire Hathaway's stock portfolio, it's one of the more surefire blue-chip stocks the Buffett-run company owns. As a merchant, you're more willing to accept Visa cards because you understand they are the most common cards, and not accepting them could mean plenty of missed sales. As a potential cardholder, you're incentivized to go with Visa because you know it's the most accepted card globally. It's a win-win for the payment processing giant. This network effect and organic growth also help Visa operate with margins that are hard to find at any company, regardless of industry. Its gross profit margin is routinely about 80%. For perspective, here's how it compares to other market leaders from various industries. Visa is well positioned to continue its market dominance. It has great brand recognition and a global reach, and will be a main beneficiary of the world's shift toward digital payments. Meta has faced its fair share of problems during the past few years from a public relations standpoint, as well as a slowdown in advertising spending that inevitably took a toll on its revenue. The latter is important because Meta relies on advertising for close to 98% of its revenue. However, a more optimistic economic outlook and increased ad spending have taken the company's financials up to another level in the past year. Meta's vast reach (it's also a beneficiary of the network effect) makes it an essential go-to for advertisers looking to reach consumers of all types. Facebook may be Meta's leading platform, but Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger all contribute to the company's nearly 4 billion monthly active users. A bonus to investing in Meta is the dividend the company declared for the first time in February. At $0.50 per share, with a dividend yield of around 0.40%, it's not one that income-seeking investors will drool over, but it can add to investors' total returns over time, and should continue to grow annually. The U.S. sports betting market has entered the mainstream, as 38 states and Washington, D.C. currently allow it in some form. This is a dramatic turnaround from just six years ago, when the U.S. Supreme Court decided to overturn its federal ban on commercial sports betting (with a few exceptions like Las Vegas). DraftKings has taken full advantage of the relatively recent developments, too. Five years ago, at the end of the fourth quarter (Q4) of 2018, DraftKings had 1.7 million unique customers on its platform. Fast-forward to Q4 of 2023 and that number has skyrocketed to 7.1 million. DraftKings is the No. 1 player in the online U.S. sports betting and iGaming industry, so it's in a good position to grow rapidly alongside the overall industry. Globally, online sports betting brought in about $43 billion in revenue in 2023. By 2029, it's forecast to generate more than $65.6 billion. There are still plenty of growth opportunities, and DraftKings's focus on capturing market share should give it long-term advantages. Before you buy stock in Visa, consider this: "

122,META,2 Reasons to Buy Shopify Stock Like There's No Tomorrow,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-reasons-buy-shopify-stock-091000705.html,"The first reason an investment in Shopify can be so lucrative is that the company is a platform business. Platform stocks are some of the most profitable investments you can find. The second reason Shopify stock is that it is just beginning to benefit from artificial intelligence (AI). There's reason to believe AI will add big value to the company in the months and years ahead. When people log on to Facebook, they aren't viewing content created by Meta. Although Meta created the software that made viewing this content possible, the users themselves created the content. In this way, Meta has hundreds of millions of content producers building on top of its software platform for free. You can likely already see how platform companies, once set in motion, are incredibly difficult to compete with. No single company could create the content that Meta is able to produce on a daily basis. That's because Meta's workforce only needs to run the software -- its users do the rest. Shopify is a powerful platform company in its own right. It launched its e-commerce platform in 2006, which allowed merchants to set up a digital storefront in seconds. Very early on, Shopify allowed outside developers to build on its platform. As with Facebook, these developers were allowed to monetize their contributions, quickly attracting a ""free"" workforce numbering in the thousands. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a hot topic these days. Many investors are focused on companies creating AI tools, but investing in companies that will benefit from it is another way to win. Technology is an increasingly crucial component for selling online. Behind every e-commerce site is a suite of tools that attempt to track and optimize every potential customer visit. For example, when you visit a Shopify-powered website, the store might already know which products you are interested in based on your browsing history or location. It can then dynamically present you with the items you're most likely to buy. Optimization tools like this will increasingly be powered by AI. Developers will be needed to build these tools. Where will they ply their trade? Most likely Shopify. These developers want to contribute to a platform that will earn them the most money. As the largest e-commerce platform in the U.S., Shopify can be expected to attract most AI developers working on these applications. All of this will only end up strengthening its platform over time, attracting more users. And in turn, Shopify will become even more attractive to developers, thus attracting yet more users. It's a virtuous cycle that platform stocks can benefit from for decades. Shopify is a true platform stock. Investors looking to maximize long-term upside should strongly consider an investment. "
123,META,3 Unstoppable Growth Stocks to Buy if There's a Stock Market Sell-Off,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-unstoppable-growth-stocks-buy-133000157.html,"Volatility is an unavoidable feature of the stock market, and it's especially pronounced in growth stocks. Investors can count on this market segment being among the first to recover when a broader rally begins. On the flip side, growth stocks tend to fall hard in the early phases of a sell-off. If you can, it's helpful to think of these drops as opportunities to pick up quality businesses at reduced valuations rather than something to be feared. A little preparation in the form of a watch list can make all the difference in ensuring you are ready to make moves when the next cyclical downturn begins. With that goal in mind, let's look at some excellent growth stocks worth considering in a stock market sell-off. Microsoft's many growth avenues help explain why investors love this stock. It has lots of exposure to the artificial intelligence (AI) boom both through its OpenAI partnership and through the tech's availability across its own software portfolio. You don't have to wait for AI to supercharge sales gains, either, thanks to Microsoft's quickly expanding enterprise services division. Growth here helped the company log a 16% sales spike in the most recent quarter. I'd look to buy the stock if there's a pullback due to the chain falling a bit short of those lofty Wall Street targets. Wall Street is salivating at the potential for more earnings growth once the digital advertising market starts recovering. Watch the average price per ad metric for signs of that rebound starting over the next few quarters. In the meantime, keep Meta on your watch list in case a downturn delivers a more compelling valuation. Shares do seem a bit pricey right now at their current premium of 33 times earnings. Before you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this: "
124,META,Should You Buy Meta Platforms for the Dividend?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-meta-platforms-dividend-121000948.html,"However, Meta Platforms isn't done delivering for its shareholders. Earlier this year, the tech company announced it was initiating a quarterly dividend. Meta Platforms has, so far, appealed to growth-oriented investors, but should income seekers seriously consider investing in the company? A dividend is only as good as the company backing it. That's why income seekers, like other types of investors, should pay close attention to a company's underlying business before purchasing its shares for the dividend. There are too many questions to address here, but here is one of the most important: Can the company maintain its dividend program even amid economic issues? Let's try to answer that question in the case of Meta Platforms, which boasts an ecosystem of nearly 4 billion monthly active users across its websites and apps. Meta Platforms makes most of its money from advertising. About two years ago, economic troubles led to a decrease in ad spending, and the company's revenue and earnings suffered as a result. However, it was able to bounce back thanks to several rounds of cost-cutting efforts and a rebound in the ad market. Last year, Meta Platforms' revenue increased by a healthy 16% year over year to $134.9 billion. Its net income of $39.1 billion was 69% higher than the previous fiscal year. Meta Platforms' success over the past decade has helped it generate growing free cash flow. True, it hasn't always been a straight line to the top -- it rarely is, for any company. But it's hard to argue with the general upward trajectory. Meta Platforms will need to continue up that path to sustain its brand-new dividend program. And considering the strength of its business -- and the growth opportunities available to it -- investors have every reason to believe that it can. Meta Platforms' first quarterly dividend per share is for $0.50. Management did mention the importance of returning capital to shareholders, but the dividend initiation is meant to complement Meta's existing share repurchase program. So, it's not clear whether Meta Platforms will choose to raise its payouts regularly. And considering how many amazing dividend stocks there are on the market, it doesn't make sense to invest in Meta Platforms just for its dividend, at least not yet. However, for growth investors focused on the long game, Meta Platforms remains a strong buy, and a little passive income on the side never hurt anyone. Before you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this: "

Likewise, longtime work on microLED technology for use in products like the Apple Watch is also being scrapped. Of course, investors who peel back Apple's spending habits probably could have guessed sweeping changes were coming. After a couple of decades of R&D increases since the iPhone was announced in 2007, a new era of financial efficiency appears to be beginning for Apple. R&D expenses actually declined in the last year. Meanwhile, Meta has also been enjoying the fruit of CEO Mark Zuckerberg's work on becoming a more efficient business -- although R&D is overall still on the rise. It seems Apple is ready to pivot as well, and pare back some spending in favor of driving higher profit margins. Perhaps we'll get some clearer direction on future project developments from CEO Tim Cook and company, too. Apple's ROIC has gone through the roof in recent years as its mobile product lineup matures. Based on this track record of successful innovation and new product commercialization, investors should hope Apple redeploys R&D spending from its scrapped car and mobile display experiments to something new. ROIC of over 50% is mind-bogglingly good. Imagine if you, an individual investor, invested $1, and received $0.50 from that investment every year going forward. That's the kind of return Apple is getting from its development efforts right now. Granted, like all things in investing, past results are not indicative of future performance. Nevertheless, with a large global user base of its products, Apple has ample room to bring more products and services (say, an AI assistant, one better than Siri) to market and make more money. In the meantime, as 2024 rolls on and as more news surfaces about Apple cutting costs, investors' best hope for the stock making a rally may be in good old-fashioned earnings growth -- exactly the secret to Meta's resurgence the last couple of years. Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this: "

127,META,This Is the Perfect Vanguard ETF for Investors With a Fear of Missing Out on the Market's Biggest Winners,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/perfect-vanguard-etf-investors-fear-104000810.html,"Many people are afraid of heights. Some have a fear of spiders. Others are scared of snakes. But there's a very different kind of phobia that affects quite a few investors -- the fear of missing out, also known by the acronym FOMO. As you might expect, this Vanguard ETF has itself taken off over the last 12 months, jumping over 30%. Since its inception in February 2018, the fund has delivered an average annualized gain of nearly 13.3%. At that rate, your money would double every five and half years. Vanguard is known for its low-cost funds. The Vanguard U.S. Momentum Factor ETF is no exception with an annual expense ratio of 0.13%. The ETF's dividend yield (currently 0.46%) more than covers those expenses. The Vanguard U.S. Momentum Factor ETF is loaded with huge winners. It currently holds positions in 574 stocks. Their average earnings growth rate is a hefty 19.2%. FOMO shouldn't be an issue if you buy the Vanguard U.S. Momentum Factor ETF. You'll be virtually guaranteed to own any stock that becomes the next big thing. There is one legitimate fear with the ETF, though. The main downside to investing in stocks with tremendous momentum is that they can be priced for perfection. The average price-to-earnings ratio of the stocks owned by this Vanguard ETF is a lofty 21.3. It's possible that this high valuation could limit how much the ETF grows. And if the overall market declines, the fund could fall especially hard. However, the Vanguard U.S. Momentum Factor ETF model is designed to replace underperforming stocks with others that demonstrate stronger momentum. The turnover rate for the fund (as of the end of its last fiscal year on Nov. 30, 2023) was 73.4%. Just as you don't have to be afraid of missing out on a big winner with this ETF, you don't have to be scared of being stuck too long with a big loser either. Before you buy stock in Vanguard Wellington Fund - Vanguard U.s. Momentum Factor ETF, consider this: "
128,META,Are We Headed for a Resurgence of Dividend Investing?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/headed-resurgence-dividend-investing-100000599.html,"They also discuss: The coming return of the ""cash nexus."" Semantics, and how academic finance differs from a real-world balance sheet. Then I get into the stock market where I have all of this training in line with that thinking and all of this historical experience in line with that thinking. And wow, you're stuck marked doesn't operate that way. There's little, if any income stream from the market as a whole. They're corners of the market that have robust income streams, but much of the market doesn't. Everyone seems content with that. As a historian, I'm asking the question, wow, OK. This is the current paradigm. Where did it come from and how likely is it to continue? The historian in me came out and started looking at what were the trends that led to the decline of income streams investing in the stock market for income streams as opposed to just buy low, sell high, repeat frequently. I'm not naive about some time in the past that everything was about the income. There are always speculations. Always buy low, sell high, repeat frequently, always companies that cannot and should not pay dividends for a variety of reasons. But on the whole, the US stock market, along with most other markets and most other assets, it's characterized by the income stream that you get from them. Rising income stream, high-income stream, low-income stream, whatever. The US market had moved away from income streams in the 1990s and for the last couple of decades and so the first part of the book addresses why that happened. In doing that and considering why the market had moved away from income streams, I then came to the conclusion that while the factors behind that, that paradigm really had suddenly come to an end in a dramatic fashion the last three or four years and that we are well-situated for a paradigm shift where the return of the cash nexus will again be the norm from an investment perspective. It's not anti-gross, it's not value versus growth, it's simply the return of basic business math Chapter 1 of your finance book will once again apply in a way that it has not for three decades. As you've seen, the characteristics of the stock market year-to-date. This is being recorded in the middle of March of 2024. There's no evidence of a paradigm shift year-to-date. It's all about non-dividend paying stocks, and we'll call it growth though again, it's a bit of a canard, growth versus value. I'm a little bit early, I got the symbolic tip of the hat from Facebook and Salesforce, but I think it's going to play out over the next several years. The rest of this decade where equities will have to compete for investor support the same way cash, fixed income, government securities, private equity, real estate have on the basis of a cash Nexus. Where's it going to come from? It's not starving investment. There's plenty to go around. We have close to a trillion dollars a year buybacks. So there's plenty to fund dividends, plenty to fund investment in the business. The defining characteristic of this paradigm from 1980-2020, call it '21, '22 has been the rise of the buyback. I think that the pendulum will swing more toward the middle and away from the extreme, all about buybacks, minimal dividends to something that's a little bit more balanced. But those two chapters deal with how this all came about. In effect, the founding fathers of Modern Finance working in the '50s and '60s prior to the creation of buybacks as a practical investment characteristic. They created a structure and the key characteristic is that they claim that investors are indifferent between a capital gain and a dividend payment. Now interestingly, in the academy, it is a capital gain versus a dividend payment. In reality, it has to be a harvested capital gain. You cannot fund consumption with a capital gain. You have to fund consumption with a harvested capital gain. A harvested capital gain may or may not be there. Involves thousands of people, involves the stock market, the stock market being in a good mood, etc and involves a process of selling your asset. You don't benefit from a capital gain on your brokerage statement. It may make you feel good, but there's no way you can do anything with it unless you actually sell it. Whereas the dividend payment is a business outcome on a stock market outcome. But any case, the academics in there shortcuts said, capital gain, dividend payment, investors can be indifferent to them. Again, in a blackboard environment in 1952 or 58 or 59 or 61 in the University of Chicago, they can afford to be indifferent because that's the blackboard environment. But in a real-world environment, investors can't be because it's a, it's a harvested capital gain and one is a business outcome and one's a market outcome. But when you start with that base, then buybacks appeared really decades later. It's not that hard to think about, this buyback phenomenon didn't exist when academic finance was being worked out. But if you think about it, it's actually not that hard to shoehorn the buybacks in and create an academic link between buybacks and capital appreciation. That buybacks generate capital appreciation. It may be true, may not be true, but on a blackboard it can be done. There, you now have investors should be indifferent to a buyback generated so-called capital gain or a dividend payment and that's how the CEOs and Wall Street can use that phrase of returning cash to shareholders through buybacks or dividends. Again, either as a historian or a business owner or someone who cares about the English language and sadly, I happened to be all three. None of that withstand scrutiny. The variance is the degree of outcomes that one occupies as a dividend investor in the stock market is narrower than the degree of outcomes one encounters as a stock market, investors stock it out. You can go to zero or go to 1,000 as a stock market investor and it can be sometimes hard to tell which one's going where. Whereas with the income streams, some are better than others, some are at risks, some are growing, some are lower pay out some are higher payouts, but the variances are lower. I think the market's extreme range of variances. This is a theme running through the book. It's a function of interest rates dropping for 40 years. That's really the theme that runs through or the thread that runs through the book and ties everything together. Therefore the question becomes what happens when interest rates stop going down for 40 years? While the rates were going down, risk was constantly lower, leverage was encouraged. You had profitless businesses or just not ready for prime-time businesses, SPACS, other things. With the discount rate close to zero the risk rates perceived to be very low. It's hard to distinguish between an old established company and a start-up with no revenue or minimal revenue. Muddy the waters, made analytical distinctions hard and choosing harder. Now, interest rates have stopped going down, risk rates have stopped going down. I draw a distinction between the two. Risk rates being some mid-single digit or higher number. Companies are all going to have to compete on the basis of cash. Now that they have the cash or they don't. Either they really are successful. Now, let's look at a couple of those fangs or mega southern companies. Some of them extremely profitable and the cash-flow shows it. Couple of them are surprisingly not. They shouldn't pay a dividend. They couldn't afford to pay a dividend. It would be unwise for them to pay a dividend. I think this will help in the analytical process, getting us back to, for lack of a better word, somewhat untechnical term, less crazy environment where you can be able to compare investments based on their distributable cash flows. Keeping in mind that certain companies, very good investments may not have distributable cash flows. They're either genuinely start-ups or distressed companies or turnarounds. Higher risk, higher return. Cash is not part of the equation there, but on the whole, what happened was the main part of the US market over 40 years got pushed more and more in the direction away from cash flow or cash returns, more buybacks. I think the pendulum is simply going to swing back and you'll be able as a dividend focused investor or a cash-flow focused investor and income-seeking investor have access to a lot of very good companies that currently and for the last 15 years have been unavailable. There are blips in that when there's a periodic crisis. In 2020, the financial crisis which affected Bank or financial institution payout ratios. But payout ratios is plummeted and then have been moving sideways at a low level for awhile. But I think they will move up and I just think that the bloom is off the rose for buybacks. They're not illegal, they're not immoral. I'm not in favor of the government's new proposed policy and probably won't go anywhere if taxing buybacks at the corporate level at 4% rate. Taxation is rarely the solution to a problem. I'm more in favor of sunshine is the best disinfectant. Again, after 40 years, it's very clear that the buyback machine works really well for Wall Street. I just don't see that it is particularly good for Main Street. The other important factor is the maturation of the Nasdaq companies. They were justifiably not paying dividends in the '80s and '90s. Maybe even in the odds because they were changing the world. Isn't changing the world that took a lot of capital and so forth. They're tremendous engines of innovation and wealth creation for the united states. But now, 40 years in you see these large companies that are clearly mature. Some of them are periodically in value benchmarks go figure. They have the ability to pay a dividend and begin to treat minority shareholders exactly the same way any other business would. That's seen as a radical comment. But Facebook had the guts to do it and as did Salesforce and I think more software and service companies will move in that direction. Out of pressure to attract investors who now with the return of the cash in excess because interest rates have stopped going down and will begin to demand that and they'll be tremendously useful again. We've talked about the fangs or Mag 7. Tremendously you should see those who can afford to pay and those who can't and against some of those companies, enormous companies. It doesn't take more than 10 minutes to announce that company shouldn't pay a dividend. They can't afford to despite their size. They spun off their fuselage business 15 years ago to make their optics and their cash flow look better. Now they're going to have to buyback their fuselage business because they're going to have to buyback their fuselage business. They are in a complex manufacturing operation. They need to have greater quality control over their business. They're going to do so by French shoring and buying back their business. It's going to cost money. The question will become less those revenue numbers than who is going to be able to navigate a more difficult environment. The regulatory environments become more difficult. The globalization environments become much more difficult. The political environment in the United States, it's the only thing we can agree on is a disaster and there is no consensus at all. Global neoliberalism is over. I think companies are going to need to spend more to do the same. I refer to it as the shift in the book from Wall Street Efficiency, which is where you outsource everything to make your own balance sheet light and pretty to Main Street efficacy. That's what Boeing's going through now. They're shifting from Wall Street efficiency to Main Street efficacy. They're going to have to and I think they're not alone. Lots of other corporations are going to have to shore up whether it's vertical integration or quality control. More on their people, plant, property, and equipment. Even service companies are going to have greater control over their service offering. The pendulum swung too far. I'm looking for a lot of companies to spend in that direction. That doesn't mean it's anti-growth. It's just simply saying the pendulum swung too far in terms of outsourcing or asset-light businesses. And we're heading into a phase of investment. That is not the same thing as being anti-growth. It is simply saying we need to be a little bit more efficacious not just efficient. You can reduce that risk by taking those out and having a lower yield. And then you can do it again and again until you have no income stream where you have a 0.5 basis-point income stream. It's pretty safe at that point and it probably grows rapidly but it's in material. At a certain point in order to generate income from a non income-oriented investment platform called the US stock market, you just take dividend risk. As I think about that, I handle that with diversification. Forty income streams in most portfolios. That handles that but if I were creating this universe from scratch, I might do it a little differently. Diversification works really well. It's fine but I might do it a little differently. A lot of US companies follow the US pattern of quarterly payment and then an increase. They feel that it is a very bad thing to change that pattern. They are right because as a individual income stream or stock, they will be punished if they cut the dividend. Again, from a portfolio perspective that risk is not very significant but company management doesn't like that. Their hands are tied a little bit with our culture of dividends. There are other options that I think the return of the cash nexus will encourage companies and you can see them on the margins of the stock market. I think it's something that investors can look for and say, wow that makes sense. That is a lower base payment and a special dividends from companies that are highly cyclical. You do see that periodically in the energy space. You also see it periodically in family controlled companies when they maintain a certain dividend and there's cash builds up and they don't spend it on something. Then they'll be a special dividend since they control it as a family controlled enterprises. That dividend could go down. Again, easily handled from an investor perspective with basic diversification 20, 30, 40 holdings but painful from a company perspective, and the optics and the media aren't good about that. If we do move to more of the cash nexus which I believe is inevitable, I also think that it's likely they'll be some greater variety of options available. That helps the companies, helps the investors I think as well, and in managing the income streams. "
129,META,"Here's the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock I Think Will Be the Next to Join Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta in the $1 Trillion Club",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-artificial-intelligence-ai-stock-094500701.html,"Few groups are as exclusive as the $1 trillion club. This club has only six members, each a U.S. company with a market capitalization of at least $1 trillion. However, the $1 trillion mark isn't out of reach for Broadcom. The semiconductor and infrastructure software maker's market cap currently tops $610 billion. Sure, the stock needs to jump another 64% or so. But considering Broadcom's shares have more than doubled over the last 12 months, delivering the required gain to join the $1 trillion club doesn't seem too tall a task. Competition in China has intensified, causing Tesla to cut prices to avoid being outflanked. Big automakers in the U.S. are ramping up their EV production. Perhaps most concerning is that consumer interest in buying EVs seems to have stalled. I suspect Taiwan Semi presents a greater threat to beat Broadcom to $1 trillion. The semiconductor maker's market cap is close to $620 billion, neck and neck with Broadcom's. Both companies should benefit from a strong continued demand for chips to power AI applications. However, several rivals are attempting to reduce Taiwan Semi's market dominance. Mainland China's ambition to retake Taiwan could negatively impact Taiwan Semi stock as well as push U.S. and European customers to competitors. Broadcom's risks seem relatively minor compared to those of Taiwan Semi. The company's acquisition of VMware should fuel accelerated growth. Broadcom's main problem is declining broadband sales and telecommunications companies reducing their spending. Since I predict that Broadcom will be the next AI stock to join the $1 trillion club, do I also view the stock as a buy right now? Actually, no. My concern with Broadcom is its valuation. Shares trade at nearly 29 times forward earnings. Yes, the company should generate strong growth over the next few years. Unfortunately, Broadcom's price still isn't compelling to me even with that growth factored in. I expect the company could take longer to reach a market cap of $1 trillion than many investors would like. Before you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this: "

Around 1pm ET, she published the story on her own site, “in an attempt to sidestep Meta’s censorship,” she wrote in a preface to the column. She then shared her post on Threads. “A couple minutes later, I got an alert that it had been flagged and taken down for malicious content,” Kabas told CNN. Kabas’s post was banned from all Meta platforms for several hours Friday. And for about two hours, she said, all of the links to her site were blocked.

Kabas said the damage had already been done because the articles had already been flagged as malicious. “That’s a big problem, because that undermines our trust,” she said. "

132,META,Amazon MGM partners with YouTuber MrBeast to stream 'Beast Games',https://finance.yahoo.com/video/amazon-mgm-partners-youtuber-mrbeast-213526676.html,"Pastor emphasizes that it is an ""unbelievable time"" to be a part of the media industry, given the tremendous amount of change underway. Drawing on his experience dating back to when cable was emerging, Pastor notes that streaming is now ""the topic du jour."" Regarding the MrBeast deal, Pastor explains that projects with ""stars attached"" to them in Hollywood tend to reduce risk and boost engagement, stressing that the Amazon-MrBeast collaboration is a ""tried and true"" model. However, he highlights that this deal also opens the door for other content creators on YouTube to ""build out incredible franchises"" beyond just the YouTube platform itself— which will benefit both the influencer class and the production companies involved. And Paul, thank you so much for joining us. First of all, just to set the stage here. Talk to us about what Quickplay does and sort of your view on the streaming industry from where you sit. So what is a tier one operator means? It means somebody who has a very complex ecosystem that's maybe managing legacy systems and legacy business models, as well as current and future ones with streaming. They happen to have really-- they want control of their roadmap, and they want to make sure that they can respond to the various needs of their consumers. And importantly, they have very big executives who often come in with a request or demand that are looking for new features, new innovations that lead the market. And they're looking for platforms like ourselves to help them drive that change in their organization. In terms of the industry, it's an unbelievable time to be involved in the industry. We're seeing a tremendous amount of change. I started in the industry when cable was being developed. And then we had digital terrestrial television. That was in the process of transforming the industry. And now, most of the business models that I set up maybe 20 years ago have now folded as now streaming becomes the topic Du Jour. But there's a tremendous number of trends in the industry at this moment that I'm sure you're seeing. First and foremost, obviously, there's a tremendous amount of focus on cost at this moment where streamers are rationalizing their content investment, their marketing investment, and importantly, their technology investment. Second, you've seen a tremendous amount of consolidation in industry where people are looking to aggregate in order to offer a better value proposition to consumers. And then fundamentally, there is the management and focus on profitability as they sunset many of their older businesses that were huge profit drivers and transform these into their new profit drivers. So this is a very tried and true model. What Amazon has done and stealing the talent from YouTube or borrowing or leveraging the brand from YouTube into their program with a huge prize. They made a huge splash. But let's not forget that there's other businesses that are out there that are fundamentally pursuing the very same thing, which is how to democratize content through YouTube like a pocket watch or a Moonbug that focus on the kids area, but then build out these incredible franchises that they then take to more traditional streaming or traditional media platforms. Another one you sell was Morphy. For example, that was announced this year coming from YouTube from Moonbug that will now be available on Disney and Disney Plus. So this is most certainly a model that Hollywood is familiar with. It presents a great opportunity, obviously, for influencers and those who build their brands in these more democratized platforms to be able to extend that IP, to extend their talents, and really grow what is basically a production company and franchise business through these other various platforms.

134,META,"Why ""Magnificent Seven"" Stocks Meta and Amazon Rallied Today, While Tesla Stock Tapped the Brakes",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-magnificent-seven-stocks-meta-183031918.html,"Since the beginning of last year, the group of stocks collectively referred to as the ""Magnificent Seven"" has helped push the market higher. The combination of industry-leading positions and connections to artificial intelligence (AI) has made this group of high-profile stocks a must-have for many investors. However, since the beginning of 2024, there's been a divergence, and while some members continue to pull their weight, others have fallen short. Meta Platforms investors were optimistic today after the social media company responded to allegations by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) that it violated a 2020 privacy agreement. The settlement banned the company from profiting from data related to minors. The FTC sought to amend the accord, but Meta pushed back, saying it ""voluntarily disclosed the technical errors"" detected in its Messenger Kids app. The FTC is looking to impose additional restrictions on Meta, which could ultimately be more costly. Investors welcomed the company's response to regulators. Meanwhile, a couple of things appear to be moving Amazon stock. Reports have emerged that the company is cutting a number of jobs in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing segment as it seeks to rein in costs. The company is reportedly eliminating hundreds of positions, including those in marketing, sales, and global services. Furthermore, in an overhaul of its Amazon Fresh stores, the company announced it is eliminating its ""Just Walk Out"" technology from stores in the U.S., replacing the costly systems with smart shopping carts. This move will also likely save Amazon money over the long term, and investors applauded the cost-saving measures. The move is designed to clear out the company's massive backlog of inventory, as Tesla reported manufacturing 46,000 more vehicles than it delivered in the first quarter. This will likely have a negative impact on Tesla's bottom line for the current quarter. Additionally, according to a report by Reuters, Tesla has decided to scrap plans to build a lower-priced model. The project has been on the drawing board for years, and a less-costly model was seen as a way to appeal to a broader cross-section of the car market. If Tesla were to abandon this long-term goal, this could impact how investors view the company's future prospects. It's worth noting that CEO Elon Musk reportedly refuted the claims on social media. From a valuation standpoint, Meta is the cheapest of our trio of stocks, selling for just 26 times forward earnings, compared to multiples of 44 and 59 for Amazon and Tesla, respectively. To be clear, each of the Magnificent Seven stocks has the potential to lead the market higher again, but investors will require strong business and financial performance before fueling further gains. Before you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this: "
135,META,Why top tech names are forming AI 'alliances': Analyst,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/why-top-tech-names-forming-144248994.html,"Thill points out that big names in tech still have a ways to go as the fruit of their labor may not be fully realized until 2025: ""There's chatter that Microsoft is putting up $100 billion new data center in...You can't do this if you're a start-up. This is why all these AI startups are starting to find partners, OpenAI with Microsoft, Enthropic with Amazon and Google here with Oracle. You're seeing alliances, and those alliances are coming together and building software. Again, it will be a bigger user for software for the internet and AI in 2025 and '24 and we'll start to see the ramp of these proof of concepts go in production, most likely in the back half of this year."" And they're in what we call POC or proof of concept. So companies are trialing them but they won't go live until later in '24. So the way to play high right now in our opinion is our clients are continuing to be long, the hardware and semi names, NVIDIA, AMD, Dell. And then as we get to the later in the year, there's going to be a switch over. We believe more to software because the software services will go live on top of that hardware. And so if you've seen the SMH, which is the semi index, has absolutely ripped year to date and the ECG which is a software index is massively underperformed as many of our clients say the ECG stands for I give up. Why don't I just own the semi index? So right now we look at companies like Microsoft, Amazon, Google in really good shape and there are three characteristics for AI to work. You have to have data. You have to have users. And you have to have a lot of money. I mean, there's chatter that Microsoft's putting a $100 billion new data center in who knows if that number is right even if it was wrong by 50%. You're talking about a $50 billion data center. These are not-- you can't do this if you're a startup. And this is why all these startups are starting to find partners, OpenAI with Microsoft, Anthropic with Amazon and Google Cohere with Oracle. You're seeing alignments and those alignments are coming together, they're building the software. And that again will be a bigger year for software and internet for AI. In 2025 and '24, we'll start to see the ramp of these proof of concepts go into production most likely in the back half of this year again. But they're going to be baby implementations. Little AI projects here and there. So we're not going to see mass market for a while because companies are still struggling with data governance. And is AI going to go wrong? And is the intern going to try to query the payroll data for the employee base. All the things that you worry about. And so you have to be very careful. So it's going to start private. It's going to start small. And it's going to build over time. And so the enterprise plays that we like would be Microsoft and Amazon. And the consumer plays we like would be meta and Google. "

137,META,"Meta overhauls rules on deepfakes, other altered media",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-overhauls-rules-deepfakes-other-140221671.html,"By Katie Paul NEW YORK (Reuters) - Facebook owner Meta announced major changes to its policies on digitally created and altered media on Friday, ahead of U.S. elections poised to test its ability to police deceptive content generated by new artificial intelligence technologies. The social media giant will start applying ""Made with AI"" labels in May to AI-generated videos, images and audio posted on its platforms, expanding a policy that previously addressed only a narrow slice of doctored videos, Vice President of Content Policy Monika Bickert said in a blog post. Bickert said Meta would also apply separate and more prominent labels to digitally altered media that poses a ""particularly high risk of materially deceiving the public on a matter of importance,"" regardless of whether the content was created using AI or other tools. The new approach will shift the company's treatment of manipulated content. It will move from one focused on removing a limited set of posts toward one that keeps the content up while providing viewers with information about how it was made. Meta previously announced a scheme to detect images made using other companies' generative AI tools using invisible markers built into the files, but did not give a start date at the time. A company spokesperson told Reuters the new labeling approach would apply to content posted on Meta's Facebook, Instagram and Threads services. Its other services, including WhatsApp and Quest virtual reality headsets, are covered by different rules. Meta will begin applying the more prominent ""high-risk"" labels immediately, the spokesperson said. The changes come months before a U.S. presidential election in November that tech researchers warn may be transformed by new generative AI technologies. Political campaigns have already begun deploying AI tools in places like Indonesia, pushing the boundaries of guidelines issued by providers like Meta and generative AI market leader OpenAI. In February, Meta's oversight board called the company's existing rules on manipulated media ""incoherent"" after reviewing a video of U.S. President Joe Biden posted on Facebook last year that altered real footage to wrongfully suggest he had behaved inappropriately. The footage was permitted to stay up, as Meta's existing ""manipulated media"" policy bars misleadingly altered videos only if they were produced by artificial intelligence or if they make people appear to say words they never actually said. The board said the policy should also apply to non-AI content, which is ""not necessarily any less misleading"" than content generated by AI, as well as to audio-only content and videos depicting people doing things they never actually did.

138,META,"Meta Stops Removing Some AI-Generated Posts, Even If Misleading",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-stops-removing-ai-generated-140000292.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc., the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, is changing its policies to allow more AI-generated content to stay up on its sites, even if that content is misleading. Most Read from Bloomberg The company will begin to label, not remove, misleading content that is AI-generated, but doesn’t violate any other policies. Previously, Meta’s “manipulated media” policy stated that the company would remove videos that had “been edited or synthesized,” in ways “that are not apparent to an average person, and would likely mislead an average person” into thinking someone in the video had said something they did not. The new policy extends to “digitally created or altered images, video or audio,” the company wrote Friday in a blog post. Misleading posts can still be fact-checked as well and labeled as such, a spokesperson confirmed. Meta announced the change after its Oversight Board, an independent group of academics and researchers that review the company’s content moderation decisions, criticized the “manipulated media” policy in February, calling it “incoherent.” The board also recommended using more labels on AI-generated content instead of removing the videos or posts. “We agree that providing transparency and additional context is now the better way to address this content,” Meta wrote in the blog post. The company will label AI-generated video, audio and images as “Made with AI” under the new policy, which will begin in May. How Meta deals with AI-generated content has been an important policy topic this year given the looming US elections in November. Meta has previously talked about the need to automatically label AI-generated posts, including those posts created using competitors’ technology.

139,META,Meta Platforms Insiders Sold US$15m Of Shares Suggesting Hesitancy,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-platforms-insiders-sold-us-120117721.html,"While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. The Chief Technology Officer, Andrew Bosworth, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$3.8m worth of shares at a price of US$473 each. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$511. As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. It is worth noting that this sale was only 9.3% of Andrew Bosworth's holding. Insiders in Meta Platforms didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date! The last three months saw significant insider selling at Meta Platforms. Specifically, Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth ditched US$3.8m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all. Many investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Meta Platforms insiders own 14% of the company, currently worth about US$176b based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders. "
140,META,Meta pushes back on US FTC's bid to amend 2020 privacy settlement,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-pushes-back-us-ftcs-230919139.html,"By Granth Vanaik (Reuters) - Meta Platforms has rebuffed an attempt by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission to amend a 2020 privacy settlement, noting that it had voluntarily disclosed two technical errors related to its Messenger Kids app to the agency. Meta disclosed the bugs in July 2019, the Facebook-parent said in a filing on Thursday, adding it had spent $5.5 billion on its privacy program and related privacy initiatives. The FTC did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. In question is an existing 2020 Facebook privacy settlement to ban profiting from minors' data and expand curbs on facial recognition technology. The FTC has said it wants to tighten the settlement. The agency has accused Meta of misleading parents about protections for children. In March, a U.S. appeals court ruled that the Instagram-owner cannot stop the FTC from reopening a probe into its Facebook unit's privacy practices for now, despite Meta's objections that it already paid a $5 billion fine and agreed to a range of safeguards. Meta, which has denied misleading parents about privacy risks, sued the FTC in November in a broad constitutional challenge against the agency's ability to be both an investigative body and an adjudicative one.

142,META,Analyst revamps Meta stock price target ahead of earnings,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analyst-revamps-meta-stock-price-230300454.html,"Did you ever one of those days? This latest incident followed a two-hour outage that Facebook and Instagram suffered last month, affecting thousands worldwide. Meta has about 3.19 billion daily active users across its app family, which also includes Threads. In addition to being a serious pain in the neck, social media outages can be expensive in terms of lost advertising dollars. Studies indicate that 62.3% of the world's population uses social media, and the average daily usage time is 2 hours and 23 minutes. Any way you slice it, that’s a lot of eyeballs, and the people behind those eyeballs want to buy all kinds of stuff. Bloomberg/Getty Images Facebook, which has 2.9 billion monthly active users, was picked as the leading social media platform for marketing in 2023, Statista said. About 90% of surveyed marketing experts said they used it for promotional purposes. Instagram is also a lucrative marketing destination. The platform enables businesses to promote their products and services through various formats, from photos and tags to Stories and Reels. Not to harp on the bad news, but on Oct. 4, 2021, Facebook and its Messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp, Mapillary, and Oculus subsidiaries went on a global fritz for six to seven hours. CEO Mark Zuckerberg posted an apology on Facebook, writing “Sorry for the disruption today — I know how much you rely on our services to stay connected with the people you care about.” Social media advertising is getting competition from TikTok and influencers, but it's still a major source of revenue and it's something that stock market analysts follow. In February, Meta, a member of the so-called Magnificent 7 tech stocks, posted adjusted fourth-quarter earnings per share of $5.33 on revenue of $40.1 billion. Analysts had expected adjusted EPS of $4.94 and revenue of $39 billion. A year earlier, Meta reported earnings of $1.76 a share on revenue of $32.2 billion, meaning that sales grew by 25% year over year, and earnings tripled. The company also boosted its stock buyback by $50 billion and initiated a quarterly dividend of 50 cents per share for the first time. In addition, Meta said fourth-quarter advertising revenue was $38.7 billion compared with $31.3 billion a year earlier. During an earnings call with analysts, Susan Li, Meta’s chief financial officer, said the company was building its Advantage+ portfolio to help advertisers leverage artificial intelligence to automate their advertising campaigns. ""Advertisers can choose to automate part of their campaign creation setup process such as who to show their ad to, with Advantage+ audience,"" she said. ""Or they can automate their campaign completely using our end-to-end automation tool for driving online sales, Advantage+ shopping, which continues to see strong growth,"" Li said. Wedbush analyst Scott Devitt said he was “encouraged by impressive results and guidance as the company continues to see healthy engagement trends and improving monetization.” ""Meta remains our top digital advertising pick and we are raising estimates following results,"" he wrote in a research note. In February, he reiterated an outperform rating on Meta and boosted the company’s stock price target by $100 to $520 a share. Advertising revenue was also a concern of Jefferies analysts, who raised the firm's price target on Meta Platforms to $585 from $550 on April 4 while affirming a buy rating on the shares. Based on an updated market-share analysis, the analysts believe Meta could capture 50% of incremental industry advertising dollars in 2024, which would be its highest ever and well above its 33% in 2023. Wall Street believes strong performance at Instagram and Facebook will result in Q1, 2024 revenue and earnings of 33.3 billion and $3.95 per share. Meta Platforms is scheduled to report results later this month on April 24. In 2024, Meta's advertising revenue could grow 20%, above the 9% industry average, as scaling generative artificial intelligence ad tools supplement the company's ""already best-in-class"" Advantage+ product suite, the analysts told investors in a research note.

(44:00) - Episode Roundup: KEY, VICI, META, XOM, LLY, MDC Podcast@Zacks.com  Welcome to Episode #396 of the Zacks Market Edge Podcast. Every week, host and Zacks stock strategist, Tracey Ryniec, will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds, and ETFs and how it impacts your life. This week, Tracey is joined by Bryan Hayes, Zacks Stock Strategist and editor of the Income Investor newsletter, to talk about how to create a stock portfolio that also generates on average of $100 a month, or $1200 a year. It doesn’t sound like much, does it? Just $100 a month. But depending on the yield on each stock, it may take you a bigger investment than you think to get there. This podcast is talking about individual stocks, not dividend paying ETFs. With a diverse set of stocks, it’s possible to generate $1200 a year and you may get the benefit of stock appreciation as well. Tracey and Bryan looked at 5 large cap stocks as larger companies are more likely to pay dividends, and to raise the dividend payout, consistently over time. Where should you look to generate a $100 a month, or $1200 a year? VICI Properties owns 93 experiential properties including 54 gaming properties. It’s holdings include sports and wellness including Bowlero, Canyon Ranch, Great Wolf Resorts, Kalahari Resorts, and Homefield. VICI also owns some of the most iconic names on the Las Vegas strip including Caesars Palace Las Vegas, MGM Grand and the Venetian Resort Las Vegas. VICI is a REIT and is currently paying an annual dividend of $1.66 per share, which is yielding 5.6%. If you owned only VICI, you would have to buy 722 shares at the cost of $21,267, to generate $1200 a year. Should VICI be on the short list for those looking for a REIT? KeyCorp is a regional bank headquartered in Cleveland, OH with a market cap of $14.3 billion. The banks have been battered over the last 2 years. Shares of KeyCorp have dropped about 30% during that time. But is a turnround coming? KeyCorp is up 6% year-to-date. It pays an annual dividend of $0.82, which is yielding 5.3%. If you only bought KeyCorp, you would need to buy 1463 shares at the cost of $22,375 to generate the $1200 a year. Is a bank like KeyCorp a bargain right now? In Feb 2024, Meta Platforms announced its board of directors had authorized a quarterly dividend. This was a first for the social media company. Meta Platforms is now paying an annual dividend of $2.00 a share, which is a yield of just 0.4%. With a yield that low, it will take a lot of firepower to generate $1200 just from owning Meta Platforms. An investor would need 600 shares, at the cost of $296,412, to generate the $1200 payout. Should Meta Platforms still be a part of a passive income portfolio even with its low yield? ExxonMobil is one of the world’s largest energy and chemical companies. It is a dividend aristocrat. It has raised its dividend every year for 41 years. ExxonMobil says its annual increase averages 5.8% over those 41 years. ExxonMobil is currently paying $3.80 for a yield of 3.3%. An investor would need to buy 315 shares for $37,443, to generate $1200 a year in passive income. ExxonMobil shares are up 18.6% year-to-date. Should energy stocks be in your passive income portfolio? Eli Lilly is a big pharmaceutical company that is producing a weight loss drug. Investors looking for passive income have historically looked to big pharma companies like Eli Lilly because they tend to pay them. However, Eli Lilly is not a member of the dividend aristocrats, because while it has paid a dividend for many years, from 2009-2014 it did not increase it. Eli Lilly is paying an annual dividend of $5.20 per share, for a yield of 0.7%.  Shares have soared 165% over the last 2 years, pushing the yield down. Investors would have to buy 230 shares, at a cost of $175,346, to generate $1200 a year. Should Eli Lilly be part of a passive income portfolio? Tune into this week’s video podcast to find out.  "

148,META,"Hoping to stall a ban, TikTok says it generated $14.7B for US small businesses last year",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hoping-stall-ban-tiktok-says-165821122.html,"In addition, it says that over 7 million U.S. businesses rely on TikTok and that 224,000 jobs were supported by small business activity on the platform in 2023. Of those, 98,000 jobs were supported directly within SMBs on TikTok. The states with the largest impacts included California, Texas, Florida, New York and Illinois. The study was performed by the economics forecasting group, Oxford Economics. It measured SMB activity on TikTok, along with ad spend and ROI, and leveraged census data and other measurements to come to its conclusions. While a report of this size and scope couldn't be thrown together overnight, the timing of its release is likely not coincidental. YouTube and other short-form video platforms could also gain increased exposure if TikTok were to be banned, and could pave the way for startups competing in the space, as well. TikTok's economic report is a clear attempt to make a case for why the app should be allowed to continue to operate, noting that $5.3 billion in tax revenue last year was supported by small business activity on TikTok, including as a marketing and advertising platform. The company also presented a variety of case studies where business owners claim that TikTok helped to drive sales, website traffic, and other forms of additional revenue.

149,META,Why Meta Platforms Stock Was Climbing Today,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-meta-platforms-stock-climbing-161401459.html,"As a result, the stock was up 3% as of 11:22 a.m. ET, reaching an all-time high. In a note this morning, Jefferies raised its price target on Meta stock from $550 to $585 and maintained a buy rating. More importantly, the research firm said that after a new market share analysis, it believed Meta could capture 50% of incremental ad dollars in the industry in 2024, its highest ever. Meta's most recent earnings report made it clear that the advertised business is growing briskly, emerging from the earlier doldrums the company faced. Meta's advertising revenue grew 24% in the first quarter, driven by a ramp-up in ads on Reels, its TikTok competitor, and a return to growth in price per ad of 2%, showing that ad demand is returning. Ad impressions also rose 21% in the quarter, a strong sign for usage. Before you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this: "

152,MSFT,Putin seeks emergency petrol as Russia runs on fumes,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/putin-seeks-emergency-petrol-russia-165745269.html,"Russia has reportedly asked Kazakhstan to supply it with petrol as Ukrainian attacks on its refineries force it to import gasoline. Kazakhstan has been asked to set up a reserve of 100,000 tonnes of gasoline, equivalent to 845,000 barrels, to supply Russia should shortages arise, Reuters reported. It is unclear if a deal has been reached. The Kremlin has also been seeking supplies from Belarus. Russia is normally an exporter of gasoline but Ukrainian drone attacks have significantly hit its refining capabilities, forcing it to rely on imports to meet demand. Drone attacks have hit Russian refineries at least 12 times, including five in March alone, and can range hundreds of miles inside Russian territory. Ukraine has turned to attacks on Russian infrastructure as a way of hitting its wartime economy as neither side makes territorial gains on the ground. More than 10pc of Russia’s refining capacity has been taken offline by the strikes, according to the Ministry of Defence. A major Russian refinery on the border of Kazakhstan was also forced to shut down over the weekend due to heavy flooding. Last month Russia banned gasoline exports for six months, which it said would allow prices to remain stable and give it time to repair refinery facilities. It had previously introduced a ban between September and November. In both cases, neighbouring ex-Soviet states are exempt from the ban. Last year it exported 5.8m tonnes of gasoline, roughly 13pc of its total production. Certain parts of the country have suffered shortages, while gasoline prices hace risen. The Russian government has said the attacks are not having a significant impact on the Russian economy because it is simply exporting more oil that it is unable to refine into petrol. Kazakhstan has implemented its own ban on petrol exports for almost two years, saying it is seeking to balance supply and demand. Thanks for joining us today. We’ll be back covering the markets tomorrow morning but I’ll leave you with a couple of the latest reports from The Telegraph’s business team: Accolade Wines, the UK’s biggest wine company, blamed searing inflation for a 500pc increase in pre-tax losses to £11m in the year to 30 June 2023. Losses skyrocketed from £1.8m the previous year to £10.8m despite a £23m rise in sales to £450m, company accounts showed. Derek Nicol, European managing director at Accolade Wines, said: “The company’s performance has been impacted by exogenous factors over the last three years including ‘black swan’ events such as the Covid-19 pandemic and the invasion of Ukraine, which have resulted in unprecedented and material inflation of the company’s cost base particularly in relation to shipping costs.” Based in Woking, Surrey, Accolade Wines bottles many of the UK’s best-known supermarket wine brands, including Echo Falls, Hardy’s, Banrock Station and Mud House. Mr Nicol admitted in the accounts that the company had raised its prices in 2023 but said it would push them higher in 2024. A bottle of Hardys Crest Chardonnay has risen from £7 in 2022 to £8 currently in Tesco, research with internet archive tool The Wayback Machine shows, while a bottle of Mud House Sauvignon Blanc has increased from £9 to £10.50. Accolade’s global parent company is headquartered in Adelaide. It said in February that it would be taken over by a consortium of investors led by the private equity giant Bain & Co, who had been buying up its debt at a discount. It was previously controlled by Carlyle which owns the Spanish wine producer Codorniu Reserve. The consortium is plotting a recapitalisation of the business, which has come under pressure since the pandemic. “Like all Australian winemakers, we have been hit by a number of challenging macroeconomic and industry headwinds in recent years,” Accolade’s global chief executive Robert Foye said in February as the deal was announced. Patisserie chain Cake Box has told investors its profits for the year to March 31 will be better than expected after boosting online sales and launching new products. It says that sales should be up 9pc year-on-year, reaching around £37.9m. The chain added an extra 20 shops during the year. It believes there is scope to grow its current estate from 225 stores to 400 over time. Cake Box began in 2008, founded by vegetarians who wanted to supply cakes that were egg free but still contained fresh cream. Sukh Chamdal, chief executive, said the baker had “delivered a year of solid growth in all our key performance areas and full year profits slightly above expectations despite the backdrop of uncertain macroeconomic conditions.” Shares rose 2.5pc today. Tesco has unveiled plans to invest $25m (£20m) in a fund to back grocery start-ups, as retailers look for new technologies that can help improve store visits. The British supermarket has partnered with chains including Australia’s Woolworths Group and Africa’s biggest grocery retailer Shoprite to launch a $125m venture capital fund. The fund will back start-ups working on technology that can make shoppers’ experience better in stores or on making supermarkets and the food system more environmentally-friendly with products such as more sustainable packaging. Tesco will contribute $25m to the fund over the next five years. Ken Murphy, the chief executive, said the grocer was “passionate about seeking out the best innovations”. It comes amid signs of change across the grocery market, with Amazon recently unveiling plans to ditch its “Just Walk Out” cashier-free shopping technology in US stores. Instead Amazon said it would be using more of its Dash Cart systems, which tracks items as shoppers put them in their trolleys. The FTSE 100 rose 0.4pc today. The biggest riser was Ladbrokes owner Entain, up 5.23pc, followed by Rio Tinto, up 4.2pc. The biggest fallers were accountancy software business Sage, down 2.8pc, followed by PaddyPower owner Flutter, down 2.3pc. Meanwhile, the mid-cap FTSE 350 rose 0.65pc. The biggest riser was mining company Hochschild, up 6.8pc, followed by PPHE Hotel Group, up 6.7pc. The biggest faller was WAG Payments, down 2.6pc, followed by South West Water owner Pennon Group, down 2.5pc. Global stock markets have advanced slightly today as oil prices retreated after a recent rally. Oil prices fell as geopolitical tensions eased somewhat after Israel withdrew more soldiers from southern Gaza. Talks on a truce began on Sunday and continued on Monday although a Hamas official said no progress had been made, despite Egyptian sources saying headway had been achieved. Stock markets had made a slow start to the second quarter as the risk of a broader conflict in the Middle East had pushed up oil prices to their highest level since October. A much stronger-than-expected US jobs report on Friday, which followed solid manufacturing data at the start of the week, caused investors to temper bets on a Federal Reserve rate cut in June. US Treasury yields moved higher on Monday as fixed income investors lowered their expectations for how deeply the Fed will be able to cut interest rates this year after the jobs report. The yield on benchmark US 10-year Treasury bonds rose to 4.42pc, from 4.378pc late on Friday. Market pricing on Monday showed traders see a roughly 48pc chance of a Fed cut in June, down from around 59pc a week ago. Investors will be eagerly looking at the US consumer price index (CPI) figure which is out on Wednesday. This is expected to show core inflation, which strips out volatile energy and food prices, slowing to 3.7pc in March from 3.8pc the prior month. Paddy Cosgrave quit after accusing Israel of war crimes in Gaza days after Hamas’s October 7 massacre. At the time, he said: “War crimes are war crimes even when they are committed by allies.” He later apologised for the remarks and condemned Hamas’s “monstrous attack”, however major sponsors withdrew from the conference and speakers threatened to pull out. Mr Cosgrave said on Monday he would be returning to run the events business, which holds its flagship event in November. He said: “I took the time to reconnect with old Web Summit friends and I listened to what they had to say and what they wanted from Web Summit.” Tesla shares have jumped more than 5pc today after investors looked favourably on the carmarker’s ability to make money out of self-driving taxis. The news, on Friday, sent Tesla shares downwards. Investors need to curb some of their enthusiasm with this stock and its various product announcements, as there tends to be a wide chasm between hype/speculation and reality. This seems to be an example of Tesla trying to distract from the current EV market conditions, which are very bleak at the moment. The world’s largest independent commodities trader has posted large profits for the second year running after the Ukraine war sent shockwaves through the markets. Vitol reportedly raked in profits of $13bn (£10bn) in 2023, down from $15bn in 2022 but still substantially higher than its pre-war earnings. The figures, first reported by the Financial Times, underline how the company and others like it have been able to capitalise on widespread turmoil that has gripped parts of global supply chains since Russia attacked Ukraine in February 2022. Amid Western sanctions and a decision by many businesses to stop doing business with Russia, companies have been forced to overhaul parts of their operations or find new suppliers. That has triggered a scramble for alternative resources and created lucrative opportunities for commodity traders like Vitol. “The scale of this realignment should not be underestimated,” said Russell Hardy, the company’s chief executive, in comments last month about the rerouting of Russian oil shipments. A spokesperson for Vitol declined to comment. The healthy profits are likely to mean another year of big payouts for the roughly 450 people who own Vitol’s partnership shares. The Financial Reporting Council found the company made “material errors” during a major local authority audit for the year ending March 2021. The UK accounting watchdog’s enforcement committee said these failures represented a “significant departure” from the standards expected of a registered auditor and had the potential to affect the public, employees, pensioners or creditors. These included “two uncorrected material errors” in the pension fund’s audited financial statements that were included in the local authority’s annual report, which did not feature in the pension fund’s own financial statements. They also found that Grant Thornton failed to obtain sufficient evidence that the value of the pension fund’s investments was “materially accurate”. The Financial Reporting Council said that a sanction was necessary to ensure Grant Thornton’s local audit functions are undertaken, supervised and managed effectively. The Financial Reporting Council said: “The Committee acknowledges that Grant Thornton UK LLP provided co-operation, including at an early stage, took appropriate remedial steps promptly once the failing was identified and demonstrated contrition. “There was also no evidence to support financial gain or benefit from the failure.” Grant Thornton has accepted the sanction and has issued written undertakings in response to the penalty. A Grant Thornton spokesman said: “We note the findings of the regulator’s investigation, with which we have cooperated throughout, and regret the errors identified. “As a leading provider of audit and related assurance services to the public sector, we remain committed to high-quality work and have taken steps to further improve this.” Janet Yellen has been in talks with the Chinese government to discourage its economy from dumping subsidised electric cars and other goods in the US. But Chinese premier Li Qiang has pushed back on Ms Yellen’s message, according to the state news agency Xinhua, which quoted him saying that the US should “refrain from turning economic and trade issues into political or security issues” and view the issue of production capacity from a “market-oriented and global perspective”. Chinese Commerce Minister Wang Wentao voiced more pointed objections during a roundtable meeting with Chinese vehicle (EV) makers, saying that US and European assertions of Chinese excess EV capacity were groundless. He said: China’s electric vehicle companies rely on continuous technological innovation, perfect production and supply chain system and full market competition for rapid development, not relying on subsidies to gain competitive advantage. British companies are being eyed up in a major way for foreign takeovers, according to Bloomberg. British stocks accounted for 70pc of businesses mentioned at least twice in a survey of 18 risk-arbitrage desks, traders and analysts conducted by Bloomberg last month. Takeover targets included gambling firm 888 Holdings and insurance company Direct Line. US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told reporters today that the United States will not accept new industries being decimated by subsidised Chinese imports in the same way that the US steel sector was crushed a decade ago. After wrapping up four days of talks with Chinese officials, Ms Yellen told a news conference the exchanges had advanced American interests. She said she had raised concerns about China’s weak domestic demand and overinvestment in industries such as electric vehicles, batteries and solar products, fueled by “large-scale government support”. She added: “We’ve seen this story before. Over a decade ago, massive [People’s Republic of China] government support led to below-cost Chinese steel that flooded the global market and decimated industries across the world and in the United States. I’ve made it clear that President Biden and I will not accept that reality again. Yellen said that when the global market is flooded with artificially cheap Chinese products, “the viability of American and other foreign firms is put into question.” Sales of Prime, a sports drink heavily promoted on social media, have taken a plunge, according to a report. The drink, launched by the wrestler Logan Paul and the boxer KSI, was an instant hit. But according to The Grocer, sales are now in freefall. The trade publication says that in the first quarter of 2024, its sales of £12.8m are less than half the £26.8m it sold a year earlier. Prime Hydration UK has been approached for comment. Russia has reportedly asked Kazakhstan to supply it with petrol as Ukrainian attacks on its refineries force it to import gasoline. Kazakhstan has been asked to set up a reserve of 100,000 tonnes of gasoline, equivalent to 845,000 barrels, to supply Russia should shortages arise, Reuters reported. It is unclear if a deal has been reached. The Kremlin has also been seeking supplies from Belarus. Russia is normally an exporter of gasoline but Ukrainian drone attacks have significantly hit its refining capabilities, forcing it to rely on imports to meet demand. Drone attacks have hit Russian refineries at least 12 times, including five in March alone, and can range hundreds of miles inside Russian territory. Ukraine has turned to attacks on Russian infrastructure as a way of hitting its wartime economy as neither side makes territorial gains on the ground. More than 10pc of Russia’s refining capacity has been taken offline by the strikes, according to the Ministry of Defence. A major Russian refinery on the border of Kazakhstan was also forced to shut down over the weekend due to heavy flooding. Last month Russia banned gasoline exports for six months, which it said would allow prices to remain stable and give it time to repair refinery facilities. It had previously introduced a ban between September and November. In both cases, neighbouring ex-Soviet states are exempt from the ban. Last year it exported 5.8m tonnes of gasoline, roughly 13pc of its total production. Certain parts of the country have suffered shortages, while gasoline prices hace risen. The Russian government has said the attacks are not having a significant impact on the Russian economy because it is simply exporting more oil that it is unable to refine into petrol. Kazakhstan has implemented its own ban on petrol exports for almost two years, saying it is seeking to balance supply and demand. Ted Baker will cut almost 250 jobs as it shuts down one in three stores across the UK, the fashion retailer’s administrators have said. Eleven loss-making Ted Baker locations will shut down by next Friday, restructuring firm Teneo announced on Monday. It said a further four had cancelled their leases before its UK and Europe retail entity, No Ordinary Designer Label, was placed into administration last month, and will close in the coming weeks. Around 245 jobs will be lost in total as a result of the closures, with 25 of those at the company’s head office. Authentic Brands Group, the American owners of Ted Baker’s UK and Europe retail operations, put the company into administration in late March saying it had accumulated “a significant level of arrears” and blaming its former owners, the Dutch company AARC. It is looking for a new owner of the retail business. Teneo said that after a review it had determined that the 11 stores “have no prospect of being returned to profitability, even with material rent reductions”. It added: “As such, their closure is believed to be a constructive and necessary step in ensuring the business can deliver a profitable trading performance in the future.” The company runs 46 Ted Baker stores in the UK as well as concessions in airports and department stores. Shell, one of the London Stock Exchange’s biggest companies, has suggested it could abandon the UK listing in favour of New York, something that would be the biggest blow to date to the LSE. The energy boss said the current undervaluation presented a “fantastic investment opportunity”, adding: “I will keep buying back those shares, and buying back those shares at a discount.” But he pointed to the gap in valuation between Shell and its New York-listed rivals Exxon Mobil and Chevron and acknowledged the company may have to take more drastic action if that gulf is not resolved by the end of next year. Mr Sawan told Bloomberg: “If we work through the sprint, and we are doing what we are doing, and we still don’t see that the gap is closing, we have to look at all options.” John Lewis has appointed a new chairman to replace Dame Sharon White as the mutual battles to revive its fortunes. The John Lewis Partnership, which runs the department store chain and Waitrose stores, said Jason Tarry, the former UK boss of Tesco, would be joining as its seventh chairman later this year, following a search which kicked off last October. Mr Tarry stepped down as Tesco’s UK and Ireland chief executive last month after more than 33 years at the grocery giant. He had led Tesco’s UK operations for six years and was credited for his critical role in steering the supermarket through the pandemic. When he stepped down, Tesco boss Ken Murphy said he had made the supermarket “the most competitive we have ever been”. Mr Tarry’s appointment as John Lewis’s next chairman comes as the partnership refocuses back on its core retail business, having shelved plans to rapidly shift away from the high street. Dame Sharon, commenting on her successor, said Mr Tarry had a “fantastic retail experience with leadership through transformation”. The two billionaires on-again, off-again plans for a cage match last year never materialised, but Meta’s founder Mark Zuckerberg has got one over on Twitter owner Elon Musk in one respect: his net worth has overtaken Mr Musk’s for the first time since 2020. As recently as a month ago Mr Musk was the richest person in the world. However, his net worth has sunk on the back of Tesla’s falling share price. The stock has dropped by a third so far this year amid mounting competition from Chinese rivals and production issues in Europe. The company’s stock, which accounts for much of the billionaire’s net worth, fell by more than 6pc last week after it reported weaker than expected vehicle deliveries. Mr Musk has lost an estimated $48.8bn so far this year as a result of the stock downturn. Conversely, the billionaires around him on the rich list have all made significant gains. The US government has awarded the Taiwanese semiconductor giant TSMC $11.6bn (£9.2bn) in grants and loans to help fund a state-of-the-art facility in Arizona. TSMC is known as the world’s most advanced semiconductor manufacturing company, making chips that are used in the iPhone as well as the top AI processors for companies like Nvidia. However, its high-end manufacturing is located largely in Taiwan, which is seen as a potential liability due to the democracy being coveted by Chinese president Xi Jinping. TSMC already has plans to develop two facilities in Phoenix but this package will help fund a factory that will produce the most advanced “2-nanometer” designs. The funding comes from Joe Biden’s CHIPS and Science Act, which has allocated billions for boosting US semiconductor production. A surge in fixed-rate mortgages has weakened the Bank of England’s ability to fight inflation after the UK saw one of the biggest global increases in people locking in their borrowing costs, according to the International Monetary Fund. The IMF said the UK now had one of the highest shares of people on fixed-rate mortgages in the world, helping to delay the pain of higher rates for millions of borrowers. The share of British households who have opted to fix their borrowing costs - usually for two or five years - has climbed from around a third in 2011 to almost 90pc at the end of 2022, according to the IMF. More recent data published by the Financial Conduct Authority suggests this share has remained stable. Previously, most home owners tied their mortgage costs directly to the Bank of England base rate, which climbed from 0.1pc in late 2021 to 5.25pc last year. “Central banks have raised interest rates significantly over the past two years to combat post-pandemic inflation,” the IMF said. “Many thought this would lead to a slowdown in economic activity. Yet, global growth has held broadly steady, with deceleration only materialising in some countries.” The IMF also signalled UK households were unlikely to suffer a mortgage shock once their fixed-rate deals expire, with overall household debt shares remaining below pre-financial crisis levels. Industrial production figures from Germany this morning suggest the country may escape a slide into recession. Germany’s official statistics office says this morning that industrial production grew by 2.1pc in February, above economists’ forecasts of a 0.5pc rise. The German economy declined by 0.3pc in the final quarter of 2023 and a further contraction at the start of this year would tip the country into a technical recession. Economists had expected that Germany would fall into recession but the outlook has improved in recent days and today’s figures are likely to provide more evidence of that. The FTSE 100 is off to a slow start as a new trading week begins, trading at 7,905, barely moving from Friday’s close. Miners Fresnillo, Rio Tinto and Anglo American are leading the charge higher on signs of higher demand for iron ore, while industrial products group RS Group is at the bottom of the pack, down around 1.5pc. The FTSE 250 is also treading water. Payments group W.A.G. is the biggest gainer while life sciences company IP Group is down 4.71pc. The company says the division will work on consumer AI projects and will be lead by Jordan Hoffman, a former scientist at Google’s DeepMind lab. Microsoft recently hired DeepMind co-founder Mustafa Suleyman to run its consumer AI efforts, as well as the majority of the team from his start-up, Inflection. Companies such as OpenAI and Anthropic have also set up offices in London in recent months amid a race for AI talent. Microsoft are not saying how many engineers will work at the AI hub. Here’s Mr Suleyman’s statement: There is an enormous pool of AI talent and expertise in the U.K., and Microsoft AI plans to make a significant, long-term investment in the region as we begin hiring the best AI scientists and engineers into this new AI hub. In the coming weeks and months, we will be posting job openings and actively hiring exceptional individuals who want to work on the most interesting and challenging AI questions of our time. We’re looking for new team members who are driven by impact at scale, and who are passionate innovators eager to contribute to a team culture where continuous learning is the norm. CVS Group, the London-listed veterinary services provider which owns around 500 practices in the UK, Australia, Netherlands and Ireland including The Vet Collection chain, says hackers gained “unauthorised external access to a limited number of its IT systems”. The attack has affected emails, phone lines and online forms. It says it has detected and intercepted the attack, which has limited the cyber incident, but that there is an “ongoing operational impact” on the company within the UK, meaning services in the country are continuing to be affected. “IT services to our practices and business functions have now been securely restored across the majority of the estate; however, due to the increased levels of security and monitoring, some systems are not working as efficiently as previously and this is likely to result in an ongoing operational impact,” it says. The Vet Collection’s website says: “We are having issues with our online forms and emails, please call your practice for appointments and queries.” Meanwhile, multiple Facebook pages for practices in the group show that phone lines were not working last week, with pet owners urged to contact them only in emergencies. Thanks for joining us. Retail insolvencies have climbed by almost a fifth over the past year, as higher interest rates hit Britain’s debt-laden stores. Almost 2,200 retailers collapsed in the year to the end of January, according to new figures from accountancy firm Mazars. This was up from 1,843 a year earlier and represents a 19pc increase year on year. Mazars said higher interest rates were causing “significant problems” for retailers burdened by high levels of debt. It follows years when companies loaded up on cheaper debt before interest rates began to rise. The Bank of England has held rates at 5.25pc since last August, making the cost of refinancing debt much more expensive. Rebecca Dacre, a partner at Mazars, said: “We are unlikely to see the retail sector trading comfortably until interest rates start to fall.” It has added to pressure on retailers at a time when shoppers have cut back on spending and inflation has driven up labour costs. Most retailers are also being hit by a rise in business rates as of this month. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei is up 0.91pc at 39,347.04, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng is up 0.41pc at 16,792.89. "

154,MSFT,Microsoft to open London AI hub despite claiming UK was bad place to invest,https://www.yahoo.com/tech/microsoft-open-london-ai-hub-160905544.html,"Microsoft plans to open a new artificial intelligence (AI) hub in London, a year after one the company’s president said his confidence in investing in the UK had been “severely shaken”. Mr Suleyman said: “There is an enormous pool of AI talent and expertise in the UK, and Microsoft AI plans to make a significant, long-term investment in the region.” He told the BBC at the time: “There’s a clear message here – the European Union is a more attractive place to start a business than the United Kingdom.” The CMA later gave the $69bn deal the green light after it was restructured by Microsoft. Mr Suleyman, who previously co-founded UK machine-learning business DeepMind before it was acquired by Google in 2014, said: “I’m excited to make this commitment to the UK on behalf of Microsoft AI. “I know – through my close work with thought leaders in the UK government, business community and academia – that the country is committed to advancing AI responsibly.” Mr Suleyman left DeepMind in 2022, before founding his own AI business called Inflection. He was hired in March to lead Microsoft’s AI efforts. Mr Suleyman’s decision to join Microsoft has raised eyebrows in the technology sector. His new AI business had raised more than $1bn in venture funding before his sudden departure. The Information reported Microsoft paid $30m for an agreement that Inflection would not sue over the poaching, as well as a further $620m to licence the start-up’s AI tools. "

157,MSFT,These 3 Companies Are Leading the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Race,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-companies-leading-artificial-intelligence-140000336.html,"The artificial intelligence (AI) bull market is here. Following the launch of ChatGPT, the power of generative AI technology has become clear, and tech companies are racing to take advantage of it, both to find better ways to serve their customers and to make their operations more efficient. Let's take a look at a few of the companies leading the AI race. Nvidia prepared for this moment years ago, building out its capabilities in AI and partnering with companies like OpenAI, and it's paid off. The company has an estimated 98% market share of the data center GPU market, and its technological leadership and soaring demand for its components have led to a shortage and given it tremendous pricing power. Fourth-quarter revenue jumped 265% to $22.1 billion, driven by 409% growth in data center revenue to $18.4 billion. Its generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) net income jumped 769% to $12.3 billion, giving it a profit margin above 50%. Nvidia's growth rate will slow down, but the company has a solid lead in AI technology, which should mean it remains a winner. While Nvidia is the clear leader in AI hardware, Microsoft has established itself as the leader in AI software. Because of its partnership with OpenAI, in which it's invested an estimated $13 billion, and its diversification across multiple tech platforms, Microsoft has the ability to deploy AI capabilities across multiple product lines, and that's what it's doing. With the help of OpenAI, Microsoft has added AI technology to products like Azure cloud computing, GitHub code repository, Microsoft Office, and Bing search engine, and it's deployed its AI Copilot chatbot across those products and others. Those efforts are having an impact on the business already. For example, management said in its most recent quarter that six points of Azure's 30% revenue growth came from AI. Microsoft also has no intention of taking its foot off the gas. The company recently hired Mustafa Suleyman, the co-founder of DeepMind, who is considered one of the top minds in AI. It also hired several of its employees from Inflection AI after the AI start-up folded. Microsoft and CEO Satya Nadella have bet big on AI, and the company will continue to look for new ways to leverage the new technology. Like Microsoft, Alphabet has been investing in AI for years. The company acquired the AI lab DeepMind in 2014 and recently merged it with Google Brain. It's also been developing its own AI technologies for roughly a decade. Alphabet has been less aggressive than Microsoft in AI, but the Google parent quickly responded to the launch of ChatGPT with its own chatbot, Bard. That has evolved into Gemini, which may be the closest challenger to ChatGPT today. Alphabet's investments in its Waymo autonomous vehicle subsidiary shouldn't be overlooked either. While self-driving cars have largely been a disappointment thus far, Waymo appears to be the leader in the emerging technology, and its driverless vehicles are now on the road, ferrying passengers in cities like San Francisco, Phoenix, and Los Angeles. The company also uses AI to improve search results on both Google Search and YouTube and to offer increased functionality in Google Cloud. Much like its rival Microsoft, you can expect Alphabet to look for new ways to integrate AI in its products as it's bet big on the booming technology and plans to be a leader. Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this: "
158,MSFT,New to Investing? This 1 Computer and Technology Stock Could Be the Perfect Starting Point,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investing-1-computer-technology-stock-133003852.html,"Kickstarting your investment journey can be both exciting and scary at the same time, and if you're new to investing, you may not know where to even begin. However, one thing is for certain -- stocks set to beat the market over the next 12 months serve as the perfect foundation for any kind of investor. Let's now take a look at one standout stock that could be a perfect fit for your portfolio. Microsoft Corporation is one of the largest broad-based technology providers in the world. The company dominates the PC software market with more than 73% of the market share for desktop operating systems. Since being added to the Zacks Focus List on February 1, 2016 at $55.09 per share, shares of MSFT have increased 672.41% to $425.52. For fiscal 2024, one analyst revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days, and the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.01 to $11.61. MSFT boasts an average earnings surprise of 8.8%. Earnings for Microsoft are forecasted to see growth of 18.4% for the current fiscal year as well. Because stock prices react to revisions, buying stocks with rising earnings estimates can be very profitable. Focus List stocks like MSFT offer investors a great opportunity to get into a company whose future earnings estimates will be raised, potentially leading to price momentum. "
159,MSFT,Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-corporation-msft-attracting-investor-130016029.html,"Shares of this software maker have returned +4.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.6% change. The Zacks Computer - Software industry, to which Microsoft belongs, has gained 4.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term? While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making. Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock. We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements. For the current quarter, Microsoft is expected to post earnings of $2.81 per share, indicating a change of +14.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days. The consensus earnings estimate of $11.61 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +18.4%. This estimate has changed -0.2% over the last 30 days. For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $13.15 indicates a change of +13.3% from what Microsoft is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged. Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Microsoft is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate: While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth. In the case of Microsoft, the consensus sales estimate of $60.63 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +14.7%. The $243.6 billion and $277.33 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +15% and +13.9%, respectively. Microsoft reported revenues of $62.02 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +17.6%. EPS of $2.93 for the same period compares with $2.32 a year ago. Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $61.03 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.62%. The EPS surprise was +6.16%. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period. No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance. Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is. As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued. Microsoft is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade. The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Microsoft. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term. "

162,MSFT,Perion slides after slashing 2024 revenue forecast on Microsoft Bing changes,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/perion-slides-ad-tech-firm-123257235.html,"By Jaspreet Singh (Reuters) -Perion Network's U.S.-listed shares plunged more than 35% on Monday, after the Israeli ad tech firm cut its annual revenue forecast, driven by a drop in search advertising due to changes at Microsoft's Bing. The company now expects 2024 revenue in the range of $590 million to $610 million, against its prior expectation of $860 million to $880 million. Changes in ad pricing and other mechanisms by Microsoft Bing in its search distribution led to a decline in search advertising activity, Perion said on Monday. ""The revenue concentration with Microsoft has always been a risk with investing in Perion,"" said Eric Martinuzzi, an analyst at Lake Street Capital Markets. ""Microsoft advertising unilaterally changed the amount it was willing to pay for indirectly sourced search traffic by all of its search partners..... that's what's causing the reset for Perion."" Microsoft accounted for 35% of its revenue in 2022, according to Perion's annual report. The agreement was renewed in 2020. Perion estimated first-quarter revenue of $157 million, compared with Wall Street estimates of $175.5 million, according to six analysts polled by LSEG. The company's stock was down $13.30 in early trading. They are down about 32% so far this year, pressured by competition from Big Tech firms including Alphabet's Google and Facebook-parent Meta Platforms. Perion expects to announce its first-quarter results on May 8. (Reporting by Jaspreet Singh in Bengaluru; Editing by Mrigank Dhaniwala and Sriraj Kalluvila) "

People often incorrectly believe you need to be a good stock picker to profit from the capital markets. Selecting individual stocks can be a worthwhile endeavor, but it's not for everyone. And it doesn't need to be. Below I'll explore why scooping up shares of the Vanguard Growth ETF now might make sense. On the surface, you may be attracted to the Vanguard Growth ETF because of its composition. You'll have access to high-growth opportunities in technology, healthcare, fintech, and other areas  -- all in one vehicle. The reason for its superior performance is quite intriguing. So far this year, both the Nasdaq and S&P 500 have set and eclipsed multiple trading levels. But interestingly, it's only a small cohort of stocks that are contributing to the overall gains. In particular, the ""Magnificent Seven"" have played a major role in the broader market momentum. Another way of looking at this dynamic is that the world's largest companies by market cap are effectively responsible for much of the generous returns this year. Since the Vanguard Growth ETF places a higher weighting on the biggest companies, the fund inherently benefits when these stocks perform well. Furthermore, since the gains from these megacap stocks outperform the losses of other positions, the Vanguard Growth ETF continues to climb higher. One thing investors should understand about passive funds is that they carry management fees. But with an expense ratio of just 0.04%, the Vanguard Growth ETF is one of the most attractive opportunities out there. The Invesco QQQ Trust is far more costly, with an expense ratio of 0.20%. Considering investors achieve more diversification in the Vanguard Growth ETF, choosing it is a no-brainer. My one word of caution for investors considering the Vanguard Growth ETF is that its current share price of $337 is hovering near all-time highs. This makes sense considering that the fund heavily weights megacap stocks that are trading near record levels. It's important to take a long-term approach when you're investing. Sitting on the sidelines and waiting for a sell-off can have merit, but given that the Vanguard Growth ETF is a passive strategy, I wouldn't over-analyze the opportunity. The fund provides exposure to the world's largest businesses across a variety of high-growth markets. For investors looking to supplement their portfolios with a proven, reliable growth opportunity, the Vanguard Growth ETF could be a suitable choice. I think now is a terrific time to use dollar-cost averaging to initiate or add to a position -- just plan on holding it for a long time.

167,MSFT,REFILE-Microsoft to launch AI hub in London,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-launch-ai-hub-london-110539850.html,"(Removes duplicated ""has"" in the first paragraph) By Martin Coulter LONDON, April 8 (Reuters) - Microsoft has announced plans for a new artificial intelligence (AI) hub in London, focused on product development and research. The unit will be led by Mustafa Suleyman, the London-born cofounder of Google DeepMind, who Microsoft hired last month. WHY IT'S IMPORTANT As the primary backer of ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, Microsoft is a world leader in the rapidly-developing technology. But competition for AI talent has been heating up across Europe over the past 18 months. Microsoft may seek to poach experts from other AI-focused companies to staff its new unit, such as DeepMind or OpenAI. The move also represents a win for Britain, which has sought to bolster its credentials as a technology superpower since hosting the world's first global AI safety summit in November. CONTEXT Last month, Microsoft hired DeepMind cofounder Suleyman to run its in-house Microsoft AI division. Suleyman quit his own recently-formed company, Inflection AI, to join Microsoft, taking dozens of staff members with him. The move received criticism from some corners, as the staff transfer meant Microsoft avoided the regulatory scrutiny that usually comes with a traditional acquisition. BY THE NUMBERS While it remains unclear how many jobs the new centre will create, the announcement builds on Microsoft's recent commitment to invest 2.5 billion pounds ($3.16 billion) into data centre infrastructure and improving AI skills across Britain. KEY QUOTE “I know – through my close work with thought leaders in the UK Government, business community and academia – that the country is committed to advancing AI responsibly and with a safety-first commitment to drive investment, innovation and economic growth,"" Suleyman wrote in a company blog post published on Monday. “Our decision to open this hub in the UK reflects this ambition.” ($1 = 0.7918 pounds) (Reporting by Martin Coulter Editing by Tomasz Janowski) "
168,MSFT,Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Is Achieving High Returns On Its Capital,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-nasdaq-msft-achieving-high-110031174.html,"For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. The formula for this calculation on Microsoft is: Investors would be pleased with what's happening at Microsoft. Over the last five years, returns on capital employed have risen substantially to 29%. Basically the business is earning more per dollar of capital invested and in addition to that, 68% more capital is being employed now too. The increasing returns on a growing amount of capital is common amongst multi-baggers and that's why we're impressed. All in all, it's terrific to see that Microsoft is reaping the rewards from prior investments and is growing its capital base. Since the stock has returned a staggering 269% to shareholders over the last five years, it looks like investors are recognizing these changes. In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if Microsoft can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead. "

170,MSFT,An Artificial Intelligence (AI) Game Changer Could Be Coming: Here Are 3 Top Stocks to Buy,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/artificial-intelligence-ai-game-changer-100700408.html,"The highest level of narrow AI is superhuman ability. Google's AlphaFold has already demonstrated superhuman skills in predicting 3D models of protein structures. Its AlphaGo has beaten the best human players at the complex game of Go. Development is underway for technology that goes beyond narrow AI. And it could be the biggest AI game changer of all. Some experts predict AGI could be coming soon. Google DeepMind co-founder and chief AGI scientist Shane Legg estimates a 50% chance AGI could be developed by 2028. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei expects AI that performs at human levels will be available within the next two to three years. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman thinks AGI will be built in the next four to five years. The most advanced large language models today such as Google Gemini and OpenAI's GPT-4 exhibit some attributes of AGI. These models probably fall into level one of general AI based on Google DeepMind's classification framework -- emerging AGI. AGI holds the potential to accelerate scientific progress dramatically on multiple fronts. It could radically change the global economy. It could also make some investors a boatload of money. With such a massive opportunity possibly on the way, several companies are scrambling to develop AGI. Unsurprisingly, Alphabet ranks among the leaders with its Google DeepMind unit. DeepMind has pioneered several major advances in AI, including the transformers that made models such as ChatGPT possible. (The ""T"" in GPT stands for transformer.) Google has also invested $2 billion in Anthropic, another AGI developer to watch closely. Alphabet could profit from AGI in several ways. It could use the technology to power virtual assistants that revolutionize (and possibly replace) search engines. AGI could be integrated throughout Google Home devices. Google Cloud could host AGI apps for customers. The company's Waymo unit could use AGI to improve its autonomous vehicles. That doesn't mean Microsoft won't be able to benefit from OpenAI's AGI advances, though. I suspect that it will. If so, the company would likely be able to monetize AGI in several of the same ways as Alphabet, including hosting AGI apps on its Azure cloud platform. AGI could also help Nvidia make better chips. CEO Jensen Huang said earlier this year that the company's chips ""can't be designed without AI"" today. Huang, by the way, predicts that AGI could arrive within five years. Now for a reality check. It's possible that the predictions of AGI being ready in the near future could be overly optimistic. Some experts think it could be decades before we have AGI. Even Google DeepMind's Legg, who expects AGI might arrive in a few years, believes it will take decades for AGI applications to be developed across the full spectrum. In the meantime, practical issues such as premium valuations could cause one or more of these AGI stocks to underperform. Over the long run, though, if AGI achieves its potential, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Nvidia could be even bigger winners than they've been in the past. Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this: "

172,MSFT,2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks You Can Buy and Hold for the Next Decade,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-artificial-intelligence-ai-stocks-084500424.html,"For a long time, Microsoft had been known mainly for its Windows operating system and Microsoft Office productivity suite. However, besides its software dominance, the company is now also seen for its prowess in the generative AI field, thanks to its long-standing partnership with ChatGPT creator OpenAI. The second dominant player in the cloud infrastructure space, the Microsoft Azure cloud computing platform, continues to be a major beneficiary of increased enterprise spending on AI services. Azure's revenue was up 30% year over year, wherein 6% growth came from increasing adoption of AI services. Not surprisingly, Azure OpenAI Service is already being used by more than half of the Fortune 500 companies. Azure AI had 53,000 customers at the end of the second quarter fiscal 2024 (ending Dec. 31, 2023), which included both AI-first start-ups and large enterprises. Furthermore, Microsoft's focus on tailoring Azure solutions to the specific needs of multiple industries through industry clouds and cross-industry clouds is also driving usage. All these AI capabilities can eventually bring in significant revenue streams for Microsoft. Plus, the company is standing on solid financial ground, with $81 billion in cash at the end of the second quarter. Hence, considering Microsoft's sustained growth potential, this seems to be the right time for long-term investors to pick up at least a small stake in this AI stock. Shares of digital advertising giant Meta Platforms (and owner of social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger) surged 194% in 2023 and nearly 43% so far in 2024. Despite these gains, there are multiple reasons why the stock can prove to be a stellar investment in the coming decade. These recommendations are playing a pivotal role in increasing daily usage of its platforms among the younger population (age 18 to 29 ) in the U.S. This demographic is exceptionally important for the advertiser community, mainly due to its high lifetime value. Second, Meta is also focusing on unifying its AI-powered recommendation system across Meta's video ecosystem (short-form, long-form, and Reels). By leveraging a vast amount of data across video types, the company aims to recommend more relevant and responsive content to users, thereby enhancing user engagement. Improvements in AI technology will improve ad targeting and conversion rates, further bumping up ad revenue for Meta in the coming years. Third, Meta has also invested in AI tools and products (Advantage+ suite) to help advertisers automate the creation of advertisements. The company is also introducing generative AI features for content creators to boost user engagement. Fourth, these AI initiatives have helped expand Meta's user base and increase advertising revenue across geographies. In the fourth quarter of 2023 (ending Dec. 31, 2023), the company's monthly active user base was up 6% year over year to 3.98 billion people. Meta's ad revenue rose 24% year over year to $38.7 billion. With Meta's user base accounting for nearly half of the global population of 8 billion, the company is exceptionally positioned to capture an even bigger share of the global digital advertising market, which is estimated to grow from $363 billion in 2023 to $1.1 trillion in 2032. Considering these robust tailwinds, Meta can prove to be an attractive pick for long-term investors. "
173,MSFT,Microsoft to open new AI hub in London,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-open-ai-hub-london-084327334.html,"Microsoft is to open a new artificial intelligence hub in London to work on its AI products and research into the technology. The US tech giant recently announced the creation of Microsoft AI, a new team within the company to focus on AI, led by Mustafa Suleyman, the British co-founder of AI giant DeepMind, which is now owned by Google. Mr Suleyman said the new AI hub, which will be based at Microsoft’s offices in Paddington, will “drive pioneering work to advance state-of-the-art language models and their supporting infrastructure, and to create world-class tooling for foundation models”. Writing in a blog post announcing the new hub, he said: “This is great news for Microsoft AI and for the UK. “As a British citizen, born and raised in London, I’m proud to have co-founded and built a cutting-edge AI business here. “I’m deeply aware of the extraordinary talent pool and AI ecosystem in the UK, and I’m excited to make this commitment to the UK on behalf of Microsoft AI. “I know – through my close work with thought leaders in the UK Government, business community and academia – that the country is committed to advancing AI responsibly and with a safety-first commitment to drive investment, innovation and economic growth. “Our decision to open this hub in the UK reflects this ambition.” He added that the hub will create jobs, with Microsoft AI “actively hiring exceptional individuals who want to work on the most interesting and challenging AI questions of our time”. The creation of the AI centre further expands Microsoft’s presence in the UK, which includes its Microsoft Research lab in Cambridge, and builds on the company’s pledge to invest £2.5 billion into the UK, announced late last year, as part of its AI plans.

174,MSFT,"Trending tickers: Bitcoin, Tesla, Microsoft and Boeing",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-tesla-microsoft-boeing-trending-tickers-082845948.html,"Spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) flows are anticipated to remain robust leading up to the Bitcoin halving, according to analysts. On-chain analytics firm Santiment said that Bitcoin ETF volume has not slowed down since the asset’s mid-March all-time high. “It is a likely foregone conclusion that high activity should continue leading up to the April halving, but it will be interesting to see whether a drop-off in ETF volume and on-chain volume will occur directly afterwards.” Shares in Elon Musk’s EV maker were almost 4% higher in premarket trading as the company drops prices in an attempt to clear out its biggest ever inventory stockpile. Tesla is offering the deals after producing 46,561 more vehicles than it delivered in the first quarter, adding more cars to inventory than ever before. Microsoft is setting up an artificial intelligence lab in London, in the latest boost to the city as an AI hub. The company said Microsoft AI London would help drive its work in advance “state-of-the-art language models” and in creating “world-class tooling for foundation models.” Companies such as OpenAI and Anthropic have also set up offices in London in recent months amid a race for AI talent. Microsoft said it would be “actively hiring” employees to work on the most “challenging AI questions of our time” in the coming weeks and months, although did not say how many jobs would be created. Boeing shares slipped in premarket trading as the company is yet again under the spotlight for safety concerns after an engine cover fell off during take-off in Denver, US. US airline regulators have launched an investigation after the part came off and struck the wing flap. Flight 3695 — with 135 passengers and six crew members aboard — rose to about 10,300ft (3,140 metres) before returning safely 25 minutes later to Denver. ""We apologise for the inconvenience of their delay, but place our highest priority on ultimate safety for our customers and employees,"" a statement said. Boeing is overhauling its leadership amid its most significant safety crisis in years, announcing sweeping changes that included the departure of its chief executive Dave Calhoun at the end of the year.

177,MSFT,Here Are My 3 Top Tech Stocks to Buy Right Now,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-top-tech-stocks-buy-224600585.html,"The U.S. stock market has been exceptionally volatile since 2020, mainly due to the lasting impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, increasing economic uncertainties, and geopolitical tensions. However, despite the tumultuous economic environment, many technology stocks have posted eye-popping returns. Increasing adoption of remote work, online shopping, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies has played a major role in driving technology stocks. With investors keen on capitalizing on the digital transformation trend, here are my three top technology picks that are well suited to deliver solid long-term returns in the coming years. Not surprisingly, the company's investments in ChatGPT developer OpenAI continue to be the talk of the town. Microsoft has successfully integrated OpenAI's technologies across its suite of products, rapidly acquiring new customers and significant productivity gains. Going beyond Azure, Microsoft's AI-powered assistant, CoPilot, is increasing efficiency and productivity for user of its Microsoft 365 cloud-native productivity platform and GitHub software development platform. CoPilot played a major role in driving Github revenue up over 40% year over year in the second quarter. While the adoption of AI technologies has fast-tracked Microsoft's growth strategy, the company's broad geographic presence and diversified product portfolio are also additional reasons to like the stock. The company also boasts a solid balance sheet, with $81 billion in cash and $58.7 billion in free cash flow. Looking at the long-term potential of Microsoft's AI-powered businesses and solid financial position, the stock seems like a smart buy now. Amazon is ready to rake in profits from its world-leading e-commerce business. The company's focus on delivery speeds is translating into higher purchase frequency by Prime members. An increasing percentage of third-party sellers is also helping strengthen the company's e-commerce business. Finally, Amazon is monetizing its online platform beyond product sales by offering targeted and relevant advertising to sellers and customers. As the leader in multiple high-growth markets, there seems to be plenty of growth yet to come for Amazon. The Confluent Cloud cloud-based platform has emerged as a major growth catalyst and is being increasingly adopted by digital-native customers, even in a difficult macroeconomic environment. Confluent Cloud saw its revenue reach $100 million for the first time in the fourth quarter, up 46% on a year-over-year basis. Confluent's recent financial performance underlines the resilience of its business model. After seeing its shares crash due to weak guidance given in the third quarter, the company made a solid comeback with stellar results in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. Revenue and earnings surpassed consensus estimates. Furthermore, the company also achieved its first positive non-GAAP (adjusted) operating margin of 5.3% in the fourth quarter, up 27 percentage points on a year-over-year basis. While free cash flow was negative in 2023, Confluent expects it to break even in 2024. Plus, the company is currently focusing on a target addressable market of over $60 billion. With an annual revenue run rate of just $777 million, there is still much runway left for the company. "
178,MSFT,3 Magnificent Dividend Stocks to Buy With $500 Today,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-magnificent-dividend-stocks-buy-183000940.html,"With many brokerages offering no-commission trading, there's effectively no minimum amount of cash you can put to work in the stock market. Whether you're investing hundreds or thousands of dollars, you can benefit from the historically strong returns available through owning a diversified portfolio of high-quality equities over many years. Dividend stocks are a great option for investors who want to invest smaller amounts of capital, because they provide instant passive income that can be automatically reinvested so that you slowly accumulate more shares over time. Assuming you pick some great businesses to hold, this process can result in fantastic returns over many decades. With that goal in mind, let's look at a few dividend stocks that cost less than $500 per share and have excellent long-term potential. Plus, the company offers a more generous dividend. You'll get a 2.2% yield through Home Depot's stock compared to Lowe's 1.8% rate. Of course, there are risks involved with this business, which is highly sensitive to interest rate moves and the health of the housing market in general. But Home Depot has a proven track record of successfully managing all types of economic cycles. That stability should serve shareholders well over the next several years. Investors are excited about the potential for artificial intelligence (AI) to unleash a new era of growth for many of Microsoft's niches, especially its Azure platform. But this business has exposure to several other big growth areas as well, including cybersecurity and video gaming. Diversity like that will buffer investors from the volatility they'd otherwise see when investing in smaller tech companies. A rebound is likely on the way, though, with management projecting steadily accelerating sales volumes through all of fiscal 2024. Like peers in the consumer staples industry, McCormick will see pressure from slowing demand and the end of big price hikes tied to inflation. But this company has boosted its dividend for 38 consecutive years at a compound annual growth rate of 11%. Having that impressive dividend in your portfolio at a discount is an excellent way to bolster your returns over the long term. Before you buy stock in Home Depot, consider this: "
179,MSFT,Memo to Disney CEO Bob Iger: Now you must deliver for retail investors,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/memo-to-disney-ceo-bob-iger-now-you-must-deliver-for-retail-investors-123042555.html,"Maybe I'm going to tell you something here you already know, but it warrants repeating. I do not think the majority of public company corporate boards, C-suites, investor relations departments, and other related teams generally give a horse's butt about the retail investor. Aka the average investor aka Main Street aka a person grinding away each day in the hopes of living comfortably in retirement. How can I make such a bold proclamation? For one, I talk to people in all these groups every single day of my waking life, and have for 21 years. Everyone is so fixated on their compensation plans, perks of the gig, what institutional investors may do, what a competitor is saying on TV, and if an influential sell-side analyst is about to slash estimates and drop a rating. Other worries include business plans, their execution of them, and nailing the highly publicized succession to an underboss. I never hear them discuss how their actions may affect the average investor. And I mean never. Secondarily, just look at how companies speak to the outside world when they are forced to do so. It continues to be some form of morse code that requires a Harvard honors degree to decode. Throughout the entire ordeal, we heard Disney CEO Bob Iger fire back at billionaire Peltz. We heard Peltz fire back at the very fit 73-year-old Iger. We saw both parties beg and plead to get the support of institutional investors such as BlackRock and T. Rowe Price. Neither person spoke directly to retail investors, probably because they thought it was beneath their existence on Earth. Neither one went Elon Musk style and held a webcast to take questions from the average shareholder. Iger could have done this; they're a media company and surely have the assets to execute (drop me a line, Bob, we can host these webcasts on Yahoo Finance). At the end of the day, it was the retail investor that played a large role in the final outcome. Retail investors represent just under 40% of Disney's shareholder base. Some 75% of retail investors who cast votes backed Disney's slate, the Wall Street Journal reported. If Peltz had spoken directly to this group, maybe he would have a board seat at Disney. If Iger had appealed directly to this group, maybe his win would've been even larger — giving him yet another moment to boast about at a movie premiere before he retires maybe in 2026. So now my message to Iger is this: The average investor who owns your stock because they enjoy Mickey, your movies, and the dividend check has supported you and what you want to do. Show them respect because they are a powerful group. Deliver for them. Meanwhile, the World Economic Forum estimates that retail investors will account for 61% of global assets under management by 2030. That number stood at 52% in 2021. Retail investors are a force to be reckoned with, Interactive Brokers chief strategist Steve Sosnick told me. ""They certainly follow the action and are attracted to the big names and oddball situations that crop up,"" said Sosnick. He is right. And Bob, you can't get complacent either or this group will turn — and likely influence larger investors more than this latest go around. Execute, or else. Disney declined to make Bob Iger available to Yahoo Finance for an interview. "
180,MSFT,UnitedHealth's 6.4% Drop Brings Microsoft This Much Closer to Becoming the Most Important Stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unitedhealths-6-4-drop-brings-122300188.html,"Even after the sell-off, UnitedHealth is still up 87% over the last five years -- outperforming the S&P 500. The outperformance is one reason why UnitedHealth has grown to become the most important stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average -- which weights components based on their rather arbitrary stock price rather than market cap. The easiest way for a stock to go up is to grow earnings or chart a path toward accelerated earnings growth. Microsoft has done the trifecta of undergoing a valuation expansion with a higher multiple, boosting earnings toward record highs, and accelerating its top- and bottom-line growth rate, largely thanks to artificial intelligence (AI) monetization and the growing need for cloud infrastructure. In the chart, you can see that Microsoft stock now trades significantly above its medium-term and long-term median. Just because a company has a higher valuation today than in the past doesn't necessarily mean it is overvalued. Sometimes, the investment thesis changes, and a stock deserves a higher multiple. Despite being a legacy tech company, Microsoft's investment thesis has changed in a relatively short period of time. The company has gone from a moderate-margin, moderate-growth company to a high-margin, faster-growth company. Ten years ago, Microsoft's trailing-12-month (TTM) revenue was less than $100 billion, and its margins were in the low 30% range. Now, it is earning TTM revenue above $225 billion, and its operating margin is at a 10-year high of 44.2%. Microsoft is leveraging AI across its business units, mainly through AI virtual assistants called Copilots. There are Copilots for Microsoft 365, GitHub Copilots, Azure AI for its Intelligent Cloud segment, AI for LinkedIn, Copilot for Security, and so much more. AI is making Microsoft's existing products and services better, which is driving margins and overall growth. Microsoft also has a rock-solid balance sheet and is reducing its outstanding share count through buybacks, more than offsetting its expensive stock-based compensation program. Microsoft pays more dividends than any other U.S.-based company, which is another way it rewards its shareholders. All told, Microsoft can justify the recent run-up in its stock price, which bodes well for further growth and for the company to eventually become the most important component of the Dow. At the end of the day, being the most important component in all three major indices would mean little more than bragging rights for Microsoft. But it is useful to know what makes up an index and how sector weights and component weights can move the market. At the time of this writing, Microsoft makes up 8.8% of the Nasdaq Composite, 7.2% of the S&P 500, and 7.1% of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. This means a 15% move in Microsoft stock would move all three indices by over 1 percentage point. Microsoft matters whether you are comparing your performance to that of one of the major indices, or you are buying an index fund or exchange-traded fund (ETF). Regardless of whether Microsoft becomes the most important stock in the Dow or not, it's a company worth paying attention to, even if you have no interest in owning it. "

183,MSFT,"2 Trillion-Dollar ""Magnificent Seven"" Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist in April (Hint: Neither of Them Is Nvidia)",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-trillion-dollar-magnificent-seven-102900001.html,"Some members of the group are faltering in 2024, with Tesla stock sinking 33% and Apple down by 12%. By comparison, the S&P 500 is up 9% this year and is trading near an all-time high. But even though some of the Magnificent Seven stocks are trailing the market right now, others like Microsoft and Amazon continue to outperform. Here's why those two businesses are a buy this month, even though they are trading near their best-ever levels. Microsoft Azure is the world's second-largest provider of cloud services, and more than 53,000 business customers are paying to use large language models (LLMs) -- including OpenAI's GPT-4 -- to build their own AI applications on that platform. But Microsoft's consumer-facing products might be an even more lucrative opportunity over the long term. The company developed a virtual assistant called Copilot, which is similar to ChatGPT except it runs on a blend of OpenAI's GPT-4 and Microsoft's own in-house models. It has embedded Copilot into the Windows operating system, 365 document suite, Bing search engine, and Edge internet browser. Around 1.4 billion active devices worldwide are using Windows 10 and 11 alone (that includes commercial users). Even if only a fraction of them regularly engage with Copilot, it would be one of the most widely adopted AI assistants in the world. Considering it can answer complex questions and even generate images, Copilot has the potential to pull traffic away from traditional search engines like Google, creating an enormous financial opportunity for Microsoft through advertising. Over 1 billion people also use Microsoft 365 applications like Word, Excel, and PowerPoint (including 400 million corporate seats), and Microsoft now offers a Copilot add-on for $30 per user monthly. AI is the ultimate productivity tool, and it's the perfect companion for applications like Word because it can quickly draft content to save the user significant amounts of time. If just 100 million 365 users adopt Copilot, it could add $3 billion to Microsoft's revenue every single month. That would translate into a 17% increase on the company's $211 billion in fiscal 2023 revenue. The potential of Microsoft's large installed base of software products that could be used as vessels to monetize AI, whether via advertising or paid subscriptions, is a key reason Microsoft is now the world's biggest company, with a $3.1 trillion valuation. As long as investors can hold on for at least the next few years, there is no time like the present to buy Microsoft stock. Amazon is the world's largest e-commerce company, and it still generates more revenue from online sales than any of its other business segments, despite expanding into cloud computing, digital advertising, streaming, and more. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the largest cloud platform in the world by revenue, and it offers hundreds of digital solutions to help its business customers store data, operate their online sales channels, and develop software. But AWS is also home to many of Amazon's AI initiatives, and it wants to dominate three of the technology's core layers: hardware, LLMs, and applications. Amazon also develops LLMs under its Titan program. Developers can access them on AWS and use them as the foundation for their AI applications. It saves a substantial amount of resources, because building an LLM requires mountains of data, time, and money. Beyond Titan, AWS also offers large language models from leading AI start-ups like Anthropic, in which Amazon recently invested $4 billion. The final layer is the finished application. AWS offers products like CodeWhisperer, which helps developers accelerate their software programming. AWS also launched a virtual assistant called Q recently, which is perfect for businesses looking for a ready-made chatbot as opposed to building their own. Q can be tailored to meet specific needs and trained on the data of any organization to be as helpful as possible. Amazon generated $574 billion in total revenue last year, which is more than any of the other Magnificent Seven companies. However, despite its stock rising 20% in 2024 already and trading near an all-time high, it's still the cheapest of the Magnificent Seven as measured by the price-to-sales ratio. That spells opportunity for investors. "

185,MSFT,3 Magnificent Vanguard ETFs to Buy and Hold Forever,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-magnificent-vanguard-etfs-buy-092500750.html,"Vanguard ETFs are among the most popular with beginner and seasoned investors alike due to their strong track records and extremely low expenses. Let's look at a few that could easily fit into most long-term portfolios. The Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund is aggressive in that it doesn't include exposure to bonds. Its composition is tilted toward the companies that account for most of the market's earnings, too. In practice, that means you're getting more tech stocks and less of everything else. Keep in mind that this fund will not closely track the wider stock market. During tech-led rallies, like the one we've seen in the past year, the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF tends to underperform the S&P 500. On the flip side, it should hold up well during downturns or when fears spike over a potential recession on the way. This fund is much more heavily weighted toward these high-growth winners, though. A full 56% of the fund's assets are invested in tech stocks compared to the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund's 33% exposure. As you might expect, the Vanguard Growth ETF has fared better than the wider market during this tech-led rally. It is up nearly 40% in the past year, while the S&P 500 has gained 27%. Be prepared to see a weaker performance for this growth specialist when markets turn negative, though. In any case, you'll pay close to zero annual expenses to own the Vanguard Growth ETF, making it far cheaper than its growth-focused ETF peers.

187,MSFT,UiPath Is Cathie Wood's Largest AI Investment. Should the Stock Be in Your Portfolio?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/uipath-cathie-woods-largest-ai-073000239.html,"With Wood excited about the prospect of UiPath, the question is, does the stock deserve a place in your portfolio? One area that UiPath has done well with is growing its revenue with large existing enterprise customers. The company has shown strong net dollar retention, which is a measure of the amount of revenue coming from existing customers after churn, upgrades, and downgrades. Its dollar-based net retention was 123% for its fiscal year 2023 ended in January and 119% in fiscal year 2024. This shows that once customers implement UiPath's platform, they tend to expand it to other departments or add more licenses. What UiPath hasn't done much of recently is add a lot of new customers. It ended its fiscal 2024 with 10,830 customers, which was an increase of just 30 net customers compared to a year ago. What it has done, though, is increase its number of large enterprise customers. Customers spending $1 million a year or more with the company increased nearly 26% to 288 customers, while clients spending over $100,000 a year or more rose 15% to 2,054. As such, UiPath looks like a great name for growth investors to add to their portfolios. Before you buy stock in UiPath, consider this: "

189,MSFT,280 Billion Reasons to Buy Nvidia Stock Hand Over Fist Right Now,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/280-billion-reasons-buy-nvidia-201900880.html,"According to Mizuho, Nvidia's data center revenue in the current fiscal year could jump 87% to about $89 billion. More importantly, Rakesh predicts Nvidia's data center revenue could jump to $280 billion by 2027 (which will coincide with the bulk of the company's fiscal 2028). That suggests Nvidia's data center revenue could increase at an annual rate of 56% over the next four years, and there is a good chance it could indeed hit that mark. This impressive growth will be driven by the ramp-up of Nvidia's new chips. The company is set to launch the H200, B100, and B200 AI chips in 2024 and 2025. Customers are already lined up to get their hands on these processors. With the likes of Microsoft reportedly looking to spend a humongous $100 billion on building massive AI-focused data centers, it is easy to see why Nvidia is expecting robust demand for its upcoming offerings. Management explained on the latest earnings call that it expects ""next-generation products to be supply constrained as demand far exceeds supply."" As such, Nvidia could live up to Mizuho's prediction for $280 billion in data center revenue in 2027. It is worth noting Rakesh expects the overall AI data center market to generate $400 billion in revenue by that year, which means Nvidia would control 70% of the market, down from its current share of more than 90%. Nvidia generated $13.1 billion of revenue from its other segments (gaming, professional visualization, and automotive) last year. Assuming these other segments see zero growth and deliver the same amount of revenue in fiscal 2028, Nvidia's top line could still reach $293 billion in four years based on Mizuho's outlook. The stock is currently trading at 37 times sales, a premium to its five-year average sales multiple of 18, thanks to the stunning growth it has delivered in the past year. Assuming Nvidia trades at even 15 times sales in four years, its market cap would increase to $4.4 trillion based on the above revenue outlook, doubling from its current level.

192,MSFT,Should You Buy This Sneaky Artificial Intelligence Stock Before It's Too Late?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-sneaky-artificial-intelligence-stock-150000089.html,"The boom in artificial intelligence (AI) spending is unprecedented. Companies are investing billions of dollars to create data centers and other computing infrastructure in hopes of winning the AI technology wars. As hard as it may be to believe, the stodgy personal computer brand has indeed been a force in AI. The legacy technology provider has expanded its services beyond consumer devices, positioning itself to take advantage of this potential boom in data centers and cloud computing. That potentially makes Dell Technologies a sneaky AI winner, but should you buy the stock? Let's investigate. Dell is known for its branded Windows-powered computers. They still make up a sizable portion of the business. It focuses on high-end laptops and PCs, gaming stations, and business PCs. For fiscal 2024 (ended Feb. 2), Dell's computer segment, reported under its client solutions group, generated $48.9 billion in revenue and $3.5 billion in operating income. The segment saw a surge in growth during the pandemic, but it generated around the same amount of sales in fiscal 2024 as it did in 2020. It has produced consistent operating profits of at least $3 billion in each of the last five years too. What's more exciting is Dell's infrastructure solutions segment, at least from an AI perspective. The segment helps AI companies assemble and build highly efficient data centers around the world. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang even touted the company in his latest keynote, saying Dell was the premier solution for building data centers. Its financials are not rocketing higher like Nvidia's, but Dell's infrastructure solutions segment generated $4.3 billion in operating income last year. If companies keep going to Dell to help them optimize the computing power of advanced computer chips from the likes of Nvidia, investors should see this segment's earnings grow over the next few years. Dell's infrastructure solutions segment could grow rapidly over the next few years if companies keep building more and more AI computing systems. It is one of the top brands in the space, and there are tens of billions of dollars -- perhaps hundreds of billions -- in sales to go after. It is no surprise, then, to see some people getting excited about Dell as one of the next big AI winners. But betting on a stock just because of this hype-filled narrative is risky. Every year, there is a new story from Wall Street around what ""hot"" sector investors should buy. Sometimes, these are sectors that turn into sizable opportunities powering the global economy, like cloud computing. Most of the time, what was hot one year on Wall Street becomes a sideshow the next. In just the last decade, investors have seen booms and busts in sectors like cannabis, 3D printing, and the metaverse. These were all sectors talked about as the next big thing, but most of the stocks in these sectors severely underperformed the broad market. This is not to say AI is overhyped, but investors should tread lightly when investing in the popular trend of the day. But the company's underlying earnings have been volatile over the same period with fiscal 2024 earnings per share basically unchanged from 2021. That said, they are up significantly from pre-pandemic levels. Most of the stock's rise has thus come from multiple expansion. Its P/E ratio is now 27, which is right around the S&P 500 average. Buying the stock at a P/E of 27 implies an expectation the company sees strong earnings results in the next few years and fulfills the narrative that it is an AI beneficiary through consistent financial growth. So far, it's hard to see proof of this, while its competitors like Nvidia and Super Micro Computer are seeing their revenue and earnings rocket higher. If Dell Technologies can push earnings higher, the stock can still be a deal after its recent run-up. But if the bottom line remains stagnant or even declines, it is hard to see the stock sustaining its current momentum. Before you buy stock in Dell Technologies, consider this: "
193,MSFT,Jim Cramer is Bearish On These 10 Stocks in April,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jim-cramer-bearish-10-stocks-142022171.html,"Jim Cramer in his latest program on CNBC urged investors not to take the Federal Reserve’s policy statements and comments “seriously.” Cramer said it has now become a routine that whenever the Federal Reserve officials “blather”, people try to make sense of their every word to get clues about rate cuts and treat their comments as “gospel.” “I can’t take it anymore,” Cramer said. Cramer said that most of the time these comments signify “nothing” and they aren’t that “consequential.” Cramer was blunt about this matter and said that because many Fed officials can’t keep their “trap shut,” people keep trying to take hints from their comments about the possible number of rate cuts. Cramer said this leads to guessing games even though these comments don’t give us insights at all. He said many Fed members talk about two or three rate cuts and then wait and see how things “play out.” Cramer, however, said that Fed chair Jerome Powell’s comments matter. He said that as long as we have rate cuts “in front of us,” the number and timing of these rate cuts do not matter. “What matters is that the Fed wants to be our friend, that’s the takeaway,” Cramer added. Cramer said that nobody knows when rate cuts would begin. Investors, he said, should instead focus on finding buying opportunities in the market since he thinks the period before the beginning of rate cuts is “nirvana” for stocks. The CNBC host said the idea that stocks cannot go higher without rate cuts is just “patently false.” According to Jim Cramer, what matters here is whether there is any need to cut rates at all. He said the latest jobs report was strong which means the economy is “humming” and the consumer remains strong. He thinks the Fed does not need to do anything at the moment and we are entering the earnings season with a strong consumer. While Cramer is urging investors to buy companies like Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Eli Lilly And Co (NYSE:LLY) in the current environment for long term, there are some stocks he's bearish on. In this article we'll cover some of those. Cramer does not want investors to buy or hold mortgage residential REIT AGNC Investment Corp (NASDAQ:AGNC). In a recent program, Cramer said that this stock “just goes down” and “I don’t want you to touch that stock.” In its latest earnings call the company talked about important business updates and guidance: ""The fourth quarter marked a decided shift in Fed policy expectations and fixed income market sentiment. The shift in sentiment was led by favorable inflation data and was ultimately reinforced at the December Fed meeting with a reset of market expectations for a series of rate cuts in 2024. The path to the Fed’s December pivot was anything but a straight line. October was a continuation of extraordinary interest rate volatility, persistent higher for longer rhetoric from the Fed, and weak performance across most all fixed income asset classes as the 10-year treasury note yield broke through 5%. Market sentiment, however, improved materially in November following downside inflation data surprises and generally more balanced messaging from the Fed regarding the outlook for monetary policy and inflation. In response to this improving outlook and with equity markets near all-time highs, fixed income investor sentiment turned in favor of adding duration, which in turn caused interest rates to rally and spread products to outperform. Agency MBS across the coupon stack outperformed treasury and swap-based hedges with lower and middle coupons performing somewhat better than higher coupons. Hedge composition was also a significant driver of performance during the quarter as swap spreads tightened 10 basis points across the curve, 2s through 10s. As a result, an MBS position with treasury-based hedges performed meaningfully better than a swap-based hedge position. Our portfolio increased slightly from $59.3 billion to $60.2 billion as of December 31."" “You do not want to be in that stock,” Cramer said about Rocket Companies Inc (NYSE:RKT) when asked about the company by a caller who was wondering whether he should hold on to Rocket Companies Inc (NYSE:RKT) and wait for a rebound. Rocket Companies Inc (NYSE:RKT), which provides mortgage lending, title and settlement services, is down 9% so far this year. Cramer is bearish on RKT but recommends buying Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Eli Lilly And Co (NYSE:LLY). In February, during an earnings call, the company's management talked about how AI could shape Rocket Companies' business: ""With AI, we are rewriting the rules of the game and structurally and fundamentally changing how this industry operates. Our mortgage origination has long been associated with inefficient up and down hiring cycles. Because of that, scale profitability has been notoriously difficult to achieve in the mortgage industry because that volatility and cyclicality have made it challenging to adequately plan ahead and invest for the future. The industry has traditionally staffed up rapidly to handle higher volume in upmarkets, only to reduce staff and respond to down markets. So those who don’t manage capacity or liquidity effectively may be acquired or exit the industry altogether. And in 2023 alone, we saw this. We saw the industry with 62 M&A transactions, exits and bankruptcies, and recent data shows that capacity is down nearly 35% from the peak. We believe AI will shape the future of the home buying industry and Rocket leading the way. Technology is the answer to better client experiences and capacity management in our industry. We aim to redefine the home buying experience through AI and deliver market share growth, scaled revenue growth and profitability. I will share with you that automation and AI are being aggressively deployed across Rocket, helping us to deliver better client experiences at scale across the entire home-buying process. Now I’m going to share three examples of how AI is driving impact today across mortgage banking, underwriting and servicing. Purchasing a home can be an overwhelming process, which is why at Rocket, we excel in blending personalized service with cutting-edge technology."" Cloud services company Fastly Inc (NYSE:FSLY) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer is bearish on.

194,MSFT,3 Unstoppable Growth Stocks to Buy if There's a Stock Market Sell-Off,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-unstoppable-growth-stocks-buy-133000157.html,"Volatility is an unavoidable feature of the stock market, and it's especially pronounced in growth stocks. Investors can count on this market segment being among the first to recover when a broader rally begins. On the flip side, growth stocks tend to fall hard in the early phases of a sell-off. If you can, it's helpful to think of these drops as opportunities to pick up quality businesses at reduced valuations rather than something to be feared. A little preparation in the form of a watch list can make all the difference in ensuring you are ready to make moves when the next cyclical downturn begins. With that goal in mind, let's look at some excellent growth stocks worth considering in a stock market sell-off. Microsoft's many growth avenues help explain why investors love this stock. It has lots of exposure to the artificial intelligence (AI) boom both through its OpenAI partnership and through the tech's availability across its own software portfolio. You don't have to wait for AI to supercharge sales gains, either, thanks to Microsoft's quickly expanding enterprise services division. Growth here helped the company log a 16% sales spike in the most recent quarter. I'd look to buy the stock if there's a pullback due to the chain falling a bit short of those lofty Wall Street targets. Wall Street is salivating at the potential for more earnings growth once the digital advertising market starts recovering. Watch the average price per ad metric for signs of that rebound starting over the next few quarters. In the meantime, keep Meta on your watch list in case a downturn delivers a more compelling valuation. Shares do seem a bit pricey right now at their current premium of 33 times earnings. Before you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this: "
195,MSFT,Veteran analyst unveils Google stock price 'line in the sand',https://finance.yahoo.com/news/veteran-analyst-unveils-google-stock-113300127.html,"Google is a search engine giant; however, the recent rally in its parent company, Alphabet, has been driven more by its artificial intelligence opportunity than traditional search. The company's Google Cloud is experiencing tailwinds from enterprise customers' AI research and development efforts, and Alphabet's large-language models could one day reshape its core search market. AI undeniably changes how businesses and people consume and interact with information. Still, given recent returns, Google investors can't be blamed for wondering how much of the opportunity is already priced in and when the rally could end. To help answer that question, TheStreet's Bruce Kamich, who has analyzed stocks professionally for over 50 years, recently updated his analysis of Alphabet's stock, including a new price point that could cause investors to get uneasy. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Alphabet arguably possesses one of the most expansive data troves in the world. Its 90% market share in the search engine market and top-three ranking in the cloud service provider market means it knows a thing or two about managing and interpreting information. Advantages stemming from its vast computing power and data experience position it perfectly to benefit from strengthening AI tailwinds since the successful launch of Open AI's ChatGPT in December 2022. After ChatGPT became the fastest app to eclipse 1 million users, businesses have scrambled to create and implement AI strategies. Seemingly, everyone is knee-deep in training and running AI programs, and Alphabet hasn't lost sight of that fact. ""I believe the transition we are seeing right now with AI will be the most profound in our lifetimes, far bigger than the shift to mobile or to the web before it,"" said CEO Sundar Pichai in December. ""This new era of models represents one of the biggest science and engineering efforts we’ve undertaken as a company."" Individuals use Gemini to discover and create increasingly relevant insight, and businesses use Gemini-powered tools to accelerate their AI R&D programs on Google Cloud. As a result, Google's search market share has barely budged despite Microsoft's threat. According to Similarweb, over the past six months, ChatGPT and Microsoft search and AI chatbot search market share has only increased by 0.32% and 0.14% to 1.84% and 1.44%, respectively. Google’s market share outside China has remained at almost 92%. Google's Search & Other business segment sales increased 12.7% year-over-year to $48 billion, and YouTube ads jumped 15.6% to $9.2 billion in the fourth quarter. Across all its businesses, Alphabet's total revenue was $86 billion that quarter, up 13% from a year ago. Its profit climbed 42% to $1.61 per share – its second-consecutive quarter of above 40% earnings growth. The AI revolution is far from over, so it's too soon to pick winners and losers. Nevertheless, Wedbush Securities analysts recently suggested that worrying about a search shift away from Google is off the mark. Wedbush's analysis showed that Google AI search results included a similar number of ads to traditional search. For now, the placement is above or below the result. However, they expect ads within the results over time, improving advertising revenue opportunities. ""We think Google remains a clear generative AI beneficiary,"" wrote Wedbush. Bruce Kamich is a technical analyst who has used price, volume, and technical analysis indicators for five decades for insight into individual stocks and major markets. ""Shouldn't we buy new highs? Many times the answer is yes but sometimes the answer could be no,"" said Kamich. ""The two most recent candles are spinning tops with small real bodies. On a bar chart we would call this two inside days but the candles suggest a balance between bulls and bears. This balance could be easily upset with a bearish or red candle in the near future."" Kamich states, ""The weekly [On-balance volume] OBV line is stalled and the MACD oscillator has been correcting for months."" He also notes, ""The 12-day momentum study has been weakening since the middle of March."" On-balance volume is essentially up minus down-day volume. MACD is a momentum indicator. The potential warning signs make him uneasy about Alphabet stock despite daily and weekly P&F chart price targets of $190 and $204. Since Alphabet shares currently trade around $153, those targets suggest significant upside potential. However, P&F targets shift based on price action. If Alphabet shares dip below $150, Kamich said those targets may fall. As a result, Kamich concludes, ""A close below $150 could be the start of a downside move in GOOGL,"" suggesting investors may want to consider that an important line in the sand. "

197,MSFT,"Got $1,000? 2 Phenomenal Growth Stocks to Buy in 2024 and Hold at Least a Decade",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/got-1-000-2-phenomenal-101500451.html,"The stock market can take investors for a wild ride, and that's especially true if you stay invested in the market for years at a time. While the downside of holding onto stocks through thick and thin is that you will likely encounter turbulence in your investing journey, that also means you'll be ready to benefit from the best days in the market. If you have $1,000 to invest in stocks right now, there are plenty of fantastic businesses begging to be bought. Here are two such companies that you can buy and hold onto for a decade or more. The company's diverse business segments bring in revenue from a wide variety of sources including its flagship office productivity software, cloud services, hardware products like gaming consoles and tablets, advertising, social media platform LinkedIn, and more. Currently, Microsoft controls a 30% share of the multibillion-dollar global office productivity software market. In the lucrative cloud infrastructure market, which hit a global valuation of approximately $74 billion as of the end of last year, Microsoft accounts for about 24% of all spending. Microsoft brought in total revenue of $62 billion in the most recent quarter (ended Dec. 31, 2023), up 18% year over year, while net income totaled $22 billion, a 33% year-over-year increase. The company also had a whopping $81 billion in cash and investments on its balance sheet at the end of that period. This business still looks like a no-brainer buy to start or add to a position for the long run, whether you're a seasoned investor or are just starting out on your long-term investing journey. In my view, that looks like a short-sighted assessment. First of all, PayPal is still the leading payment processing provider globally, which is no small feat given the competition in this fast-growing space. At last count, the company controlled a whopping 45% of the entire global payment processing market. Now, it's true that PayPal's growth story is highly connected to the overall trajectory of discretionary spending, particularly through mediums like e-commerce. While e-commerce spending is in flux right now as many consumer wallets remained constrained globally, these are relatively short-term headwinds when you're looking at an investment window of 10 years or more. Global e-commerce spending is on track to hit a valuation of nearly $50 trillion by the year 2030. In short, there's plenty of room left to run here even with the emergence of other competitors in the payment processing space. And PayPal's financials are looking pretty solid overall, despite the ongoing challenges. In the full year 2023, PayPal reported net revenue of approximately $30 billion, up 8% from 2022. Compare that to the company's full-year 2020 revenue, which came in at around $22 billion, and you have a three-year growth rate of about 36%. While transaction margin dollars and active accounts decreased by respective amounts of 1% and 2% in 2023, PayPal's total payment volume last year jumped 13% from 2022 to $1.5 trillion. PayPal reported that payment transactions increased a healthy 12% in 2023 to $25 billion, and payment transactions per active account rose 14% on a trailing-12-month basis as of the end of the year. The company generated operating cash flow of $4.8 billion and free cash flow of $4.2 billion in the 12-month period. PayPal also improved its bottom line in 2023 to the tune of about 76%, reporting a profit according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) of around $4.2 billion. With the stock trading at a price-to-sales ratio of about 2.4, now could be a good time to scoop up even a few shares at a discount. "
198,MSFT,"Nvidia Just Bought 5 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks, and 1 Is Up 142% Already",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-just-bought-5-artificial-095900069.html,"The heightened interest in artificial intelligence (AI) is the primary driver of that value creation. Nvidia makes the industry's most powerful graphics processing units (GPUs) for data centers, which developers use to build, train, and deploy their AI models. Those chips drove Nvidia's data center revenue to more than triple in fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 28), and the momentum looks set to continue in fiscal 2025. Nvidia is now using some of its newly acquired wealth to invest in other AI companies, which could hint at where the next wave of AI value is created. Nvidia filed its first-ever 13-F with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Feb. 14, and it publicly revealed new holdings in five different stocks: SoundHound AI stock has been the best performer of the bunch so far, with a 142% gain in 2024 already. It values Nvidia's stake at around $8.7 million, which doesn't sound like much, but SoundHound is only a $1.5 billion company. So should investors follow Nvidia into the conversational AI specialist? That opens up a range of possibilities, especially in use cases where hands-free functionality is required. For example, restaurant chains use SoundHound's Employee Assist technology to help workers get fast answers to questions in high-pressure situations, like when they might be serving customers or completing operational tasks. The Drive platform is Nvidia's end-to-end solution for car manufacturers wanting to install autonomous self-driving capabilities into their new vehicles. Drive could become a key distribution channel for SoundHound's technology over the long term, considering it already serves many of the world's leading car brands. SoundHound brought in $45.8 million in revenue during 2023, which was a 47% increase compared to 2022. The company is still in the scale-up phase, although it did finish last year with a $661 million order backlog -- and that number doubled from the end of 2022. Management's forecast for 2024 points to around $70 million in revenue, which would represent an accelerated growth rate of 54%. That's great news, but SoundHound's bottom line warrants some concern in the near term because the company lost $91.7 million last year. While it's normal for small technology companies in their growth phase to lose money, SoundHound only has $95.2 million in cash and equivalents on its balance sheet, so it can't afford another year like that in 2024. The financial picture outlined above makes SoundHound stock a risky investment relative to other AI stocks like Nvidia or Microsoft. There is a strong possibility the company will need a cash injection within the next year or two to continue operating, and that creates uncertainty. With that said, Nvidia's investment in SoundHound stock is a big vote of confidence, and it could breed more unique deals like the one with its Drive platform. Plus, SoundHound's order backlog could lead to accelerated revenue growth in the coming years. But remember this: Nvidia's stake in SoundHound is only worth $8.7 million. If it went to zero, it would have virtually no impact on the $2.2 trillion chip giant. It would be the equivalent of someone with a net worth of $100,000 losing $0.39 -- yes, 39 cents. Not only does the average investor have fewer resources than Nvidia, but they might also have a very different risk appetite. Therefore, buying SoundHound stock should be reserved for investors with a stomach for volatility, and the potential for losses. Before you buy stock in SoundHound AI, consider this: "
199,MSFT,"Here's the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock I Think Will Be the Next to Join Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta in the $1 Trillion Club",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-artificial-intelligence-ai-stock-094500701.html,"Few groups are as exclusive as the $1 trillion club. This club has only six members, each a U.S. company with a market capitalization of at least $1 trillion. However, the $1 trillion mark isn't out of reach for Broadcom. The semiconductor and infrastructure software maker's market cap currently tops $610 billion. Sure, the stock needs to jump another 64% or so. But considering Broadcom's shares have more than doubled over the last 12 months, delivering the required gain to join the $1 trillion club doesn't seem too tall a task. Competition in China has intensified, causing Tesla to cut prices to avoid being outflanked. Big automakers in the U.S. are ramping up their EV production. Perhaps most concerning is that consumer interest in buying EVs seems to have stalled. I suspect Taiwan Semi presents a greater threat to beat Broadcom to $1 trillion. The semiconductor maker's market cap is close to $620 billion, neck and neck with Broadcom's. Both companies should benefit from a strong continued demand for chips to power AI applications. However, several rivals are attempting to reduce Taiwan Semi's market dominance. Mainland China's ambition to retake Taiwan could negatively impact Taiwan Semi stock as well as push U.S. and European customers to competitors. Broadcom's risks seem relatively minor compared to those of Taiwan Semi. The company's acquisition of VMware should fuel accelerated growth. Broadcom's main problem is declining broadband sales and telecommunications companies reducing their spending. Since I predict that Broadcom will be the next AI stock to join the $1 trillion club, do I also view the stock as a buy right now? Actually, no. My concern with Broadcom is its valuation. Shares trade at nearly 29 times forward earnings. Yes, the company should generate strong growth over the next few years. Unfortunately, Broadcom's price still isn't compelling to me even with that growth factored in. I expect the company could take longer to reach a market cap of $1 trillion than many investors would like. Before you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this: "
200,GOOG,YouTube TV challenged cable by doing one simple thing — imitating it,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/youtube-tv-challenged-cable-by-doing-one-simple-thing--imitating-it-153308088.html,"YouTube TV, the internet pay-TV service that allows viewers to watch live channels and access local broadcast networks like ABC, CBS, FOX, and NBC, first launched in 2017. Since then, its breadth of content as well as its price of just over $70 per month has made it attractive to consumers looking for a cheaper replacement for their cable packages. ""We hear from our users that they want to be able to watch all their favorite content in one place, and they want to be able to manage all of their subscriptions in one place,"" Christian Oestlien, vice president of product management at YouTube, told Yahoo Finance. ""There's a bit of this subscription fatigue."" In total, YouTube jumped to a platform-best 9.3% of total US TV viewing, up from the prior-year period's 7.9%. It also delivered a sizable beat compared to Netflix's 7.8% market share. Broadcast and cable continued to see yearly declines, contributing to a combined 50.9% of overall TV viewing — down from 54% in February 2023. It's a significant feat for YouTube considering the fragmented media landscape. YouTube TV has capitalized on that demand. For Alphabet, YouTube has become an increasingly important segment of the company with revenue from its annual subscription services, which includes YouTube TV, YouTube Premium, YouTube Music, and Google One cloud storage, amounting to $15 billion in the fourth quarter. ""YouTube is the key driver of our subscription revenues,"" Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said during the company's Q4 earnings call in January. MoffettNathanson emphasized YouTube's importance in a note published on March 28, arguing it's the tech giant's second-most-important business to date — just behind its generative artificial intelligence efforts. ""With the growing success of their two leading subscription services (YouTube TV and YouTube Music), YouTube’s revenue growth accelerated by an estimated 17% in 2023 — almost double the 2022 growth rate,"" analyst Michael Nathanson wrote. ""If YouTube was a standalone business, public comps suggest the business would be worth $375 to $400 billion."" MoffettNathanson expects YouTube to generate 16% margins by 2026 with operating profits expected to double to $11 billion. To compare, Netflix reported full-year 2023 operating margins of 21%. ""For YouTube TV, sports underpins the entire experience,"" Oestlien said. ""Sports has always been a really critical component of what I think makes YouTube TV special."" Sunday Ticket, which makes out-of-market games available to fans nationwide, is currently available as an add-on package on YouTube TV or as a standalone à la carte service on YouTube Primetime Channels. Oestlien categorized the Sunday Ticket launch as a ""great moment"" for the company, adding the package has served as a key driver for increased word-of-mouth subscriptions as more consumers cut the cable cord: ""It was something that really captured people's attention."" But YouTube will face more competition in sports going forward. Oestlien shrugged off the increased competition. Rather, he said the upcoming launches could open up more partnership opportunities for YouTube TV. ""A lot of the platforms that you would think would be competitors of ours are actually some of our closest partners,"" he said. ""The three companies that are partnered in this new streaming service are all really good partners of ours that we interact with on a daily basis. I'm personally really excited to see them leaning into offering more consumer choice."" ""YouTube and these other Big Tech companies are sitting on a lot of cash,"" said Jon Christian, executive vice president of digital media supply chain at Qvest, a media and entertainment-focused consulting company. ""They have the ability to pounce on these things and have so much more flexibility because they're not burdened by a ton of debt. They also have the hardware and the infrastructure to support all of this [live streaming programming.]"" Oestlien wouldn't give specifics on YouTube's current negotiations. But he did emphasize the opportunity within the growing sports streaming marketplace.

203,GOOG,Could Alphabet Stock Help You Retire a Millionaire?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/could-alphabet-stock-help-retire-161500532.html,"The stock IPO'd at $85 in 2004, opened at $100, and closed its first day of trading at $100.34, so an ordinary investor could have easily bought the stock around $100 a share at the time of its debut. The company would later enact two stock splits, a nearly 2-to-1 split in March 2014 and a 20-to-1 split in July 2022. So if you bought what was then Google stock at $100 the first day it traded, you would have a split-adjusted cost basis of around $2.50 and a $20,000 investment would be worth close to $1.2 million today. Alphabet may not generate the same eye-popping returns it did in its first 20 years as a public company, but it still can be a core holding that can help you retire a millionaire. Not surprisingly, Alphabet is best known for its Google search engine. Google has become synonymous with search, leading to an estimated 90% global market share. Google is a cash cow for the company, with the search engine generating $175 billion in revenue in 2023, an increase of nearly 8% from 2022. The solid revenue increase came despite 2023 being a relatively slow year for advertising growth as many advertisers were cautious with their ad budgets given uncertainties over the economy. However, search revenue often tends to be less economically sensitive compared to other types of advertising. The reason is that this type of advertising is performance-based and thus has a more measurable impact on sales. Alphabet's other big business is YouTube, which generated $31.5 billion in revenue in 2023, up 8%. Like Google, it also gets much of its revenue from advertising. However, the company's YouTube Premium and Music services just surpassed 100 million subscribers. Both services offer ad-free content and contributed about $15 billion of YouTube's revenue. Given its dominant position in search and strong cloud and YouTube businesses, Alphabet is trading at an inexpensive valuation despite trading near an all-time high. It trades at a forward P/E of about 22.5 times and an enterprise value-to-EBITDA ratio of just 12.5 times. The latter metric takes into consideration the company's large net cash position of $97.7 billion and removes any non-cash items. This alone makes the stock a buy. However, the big reason to own Alphabet over the long term, and why it could help you retire a millionaire, is its underrated position in artificial intelligence (AI). The company is currently seeing the most beneficial impact from AI in its cloud service business, where it has credited AI for helping it win and expand deals last quarter. However, there is some fear among investors that AI could disrupt Google's search dominance. So far there has been little indication of this happening. Traditional linked-based search results will likely continue to be the best way to serve users actively looking to buy a product or service. This represents only about 20% of searches done on Google, and it's the only time the company serves up ads. AI, meanwhile, could help the company profit from the 80% of searches for which it does not provide ads. For example, AI could provide Alphabet the opportunity to profit from questions answered using AI, either through brand advertising or a subscription service. The landscape is evolving with AI, but companies will undoubtedly find new ways to profit from its uses and capabilities. Twenty years ago Google was only a search engine that IPO'd with a $23 billion market cap. Today, the company owns two non-search businesses that generate over $30 billion a year in revenue in Google Cloud Services and YouTube, along with its powerful search business. While it's difficult to predict where a stock will be in the next 20 years, Alphabet should be viewed as a core holding that can help power your portfolio.

207,GOOG,"Amazon's AI Eyesore. After Just Walk Out Fail, Should Investors Be Worried?",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazons-ai-eyesore-just-walk-143000045.html,"Amazon has pushed back on that claim, but the company does seem to be largely stepping back from its Just Walk Out technology, which at the time of launch appeared to be as disruptive as anything else that had come out of Amazon. Licensing it to other retailers also seemed like a viable, potentially multi-billion-dollar revenue stream. Those hopes now seem totally dashed. So what does all this mean for investors considering Amazon stock? Let's dive in. Whether or not it's true that 70% of Just Walk Out transactions were verified in India, Amazon is pulling the technology from its Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods grocery stores in the U.S. A little more than half of Amazon Fresh stores had Just Walk Out installed only recently. The technology will remain in the Amazon Go convenience stores. Rather than using Just Walk Out, Amazon is leaning into its smart Dash Carts, which have a scanner and screen contained in the shopping cart so they can track your purchases as you shop and show you how much you've spent. Amazon sees these carts as a more reliable and practical solution, and they give shoppers the ability to see how much they're spending as they shop, which Just Walk Out does not do. Under CEO Andy Jassy, who took over from Jeff Bezos in 2021, Amazon has focused more on cost-cutting and driving profitability rather than innovating -- its historical strength. Scaling back the Just Walk Out technology seems like a logical step under that regime as the technology was not living up to its promise. But it also represents a significant failure in an area of artificial intelligence where Amazon seemed to have an advantage. Other signs have emerged that call Amazon's AI strategy into doubt. The company just announced it was cutting several hundred jobs at its Amazon Web Services cloud computing division, a sign that growth in that segment may not be living up to expectations.

209,GOOG,These 3 Companies Are Leading the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Race,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-companies-leading-artificial-intelligence-140000336.html,"The artificial intelligence (AI) bull market is here. Following the launch of ChatGPT, the power of generative AI technology has become clear, and tech companies are racing to take advantage of it, both to find better ways to serve their customers and to make their operations more efficient. Let's take a look at a few of the companies leading the AI race. Nvidia prepared for this moment years ago, building out its capabilities in AI and partnering with companies like OpenAI, and it's paid off. The company has an estimated 98% market share of the data center GPU market, and its technological leadership and soaring demand for its components have led to a shortage and given it tremendous pricing power. Fourth-quarter revenue jumped 265% to $22.1 billion, driven by 409% growth in data center revenue to $18.4 billion. Its generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) net income jumped 769% to $12.3 billion, giving it a profit margin above 50%. Nvidia's growth rate will slow down, but the company has a solid lead in AI technology, which should mean it remains a winner. While Nvidia is the clear leader in AI hardware, Microsoft has established itself as the leader in AI software. Because of its partnership with OpenAI, in which it's invested an estimated $13 billion, and its diversification across multiple tech platforms, Microsoft has the ability to deploy AI capabilities across multiple product lines, and that's what it's doing. With the help of OpenAI, Microsoft has added AI technology to products like Azure cloud computing, GitHub code repository, Microsoft Office, and Bing search engine, and it's deployed its AI Copilot chatbot across those products and others. Those efforts are having an impact on the business already. For example, management said in its most recent quarter that six points of Azure's 30% revenue growth came from AI. Microsoft also has no intention of taking its foot off the gas. The company recently hired Mustafa Suleyman, the co-founder of DeepMind, who is considered one of the top minds in AI. It also hired several of its employees from Inflection AI after the AI start-up folded. Microsoft and CEO Satya Nadella have bet big on AI, and the company will continue to look for new ways to leverage the new technology. Like Microsoft, Alphabet has been investing in AI for years. The company acquired the AI lab DeepMind in 2014 and recently merged it with Google Brain. It's also been developing its own AI technologies for roughly a decade. Alphabet has been less aggressive than Microsoft in AI, but the Google parent quickly responded to the launch of ChatGPT with its own chatbot, Bard. That has evolved into Gemini, which may be the closest challenger to ChatGPT today. Alphabet's investments in its Waymo autonomous vehicle subsidiary shouldn't be overlooked either. While self-driving cars have largely been a disappointment thus far, Waymo appears to be the leader in the emerging technology, and its driverless vehicles are now on the road, ferrying passengers in cities like San Francisco, Phoenix, and Los Angeles. The company also uses AI to improve search results on both Google Search and YouTube and to offer increased functionality in Google Cloud. Much like its rival Microsoft, you can expect Alphabet to look for new ways to integrate AI in its products as it's bet big on the booming technology and plans to be a leader.

210,GOOG,Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alphabet-inc-goog-trending-stock-130015337.html,"Shares of this company have returned +13% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.6% change. The Zacks Internet - Services industry, to which Alphabet belongs, has gained 13.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term? While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making. Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings. Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements. For the current quarter, Alphabet is expected to post earnings of $1.49 per share, indicating a change of +27.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days. For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.77 points to a change of +16.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged. For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.75 indicates a change of +14.5% from what Alphabet is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged. Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Alphabet is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate: Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial. In the case of Alphabet, the consensus sales estimate of $65.95 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +13.6%. The $286.48 billion and $318.3 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +11.7% and +11.1%, respectively. Alphabet reported revenues of $72.32 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +14.6%. EPS of $1.64 for the same period compares with $1.05 a year ago. Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $70.81 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.14%. The EPS surprise was +2.5%. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period. No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance. While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price. The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued. Alphabet is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade. The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alphabet. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term. "

212,GOOG,An Artificial Intelligence (AI) Game Changer Could Be Coming: Here Are 3 Top Stocks to Buy,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/artificial-intelligence-ai-game-changer-100700408.html,"The highest level of narrow AI is superhuman ability. Google's AlphaFold has already demonstrated superhuman skills in predicting 3D models of protein structures. Its AlphaGo has beaten the best human players at the complex game of Go. Development is underway for technology that goes beyond narrow AI. And it could be the biggest AI game changer of all. Some experts predict AGI could be coming soon. Google DeepMind co-founder and chief AGI scientist Shane Legg estimates a 50% chance AGI could be developed by 2028. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei expects AI that performs at human levels will be available within the next two to three years. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman thinks AGI will be built in the next four to five years. The most advanced large language models today such as Google Gemini and OpenAI's GPT-4 exhibit some attributes of AGI. These models probably fall into level one of general AI based on Google DeepMind's classification framework -- emerging AGI. AGI holds the potential to accelerate scientific progress dramatically on multiple fronts. It could radically change the global economy. It could also make some investors a boatload of money. With such a massive opportunity possibly on the way, several companies are scrambling to develop AGI. Unsurprisingly, Alphabet ranks among the leaders with its Google DeepMind unit. DeepMind has pioneered several major advances in AI, including the transformers that made models such as ChatGPT possible. (The ""T"" in GPT stands for transformer.) Google has also invested $2 billion in Anthropic, another AGI developer to watch closely. Alphabet could profit from AGI in several ways. It could use the technology to power virtual assistants that revolutionize (and possibly replace) search engines. AGI could be integrated throughout Google Home devices. Google Cloud could host AGI apps for customers. The company's Waymo unit could use AGI to improve its autonomous vehicles. That doesn't mean Microsoft won't be able to benefit from OpenAI's AGI advances, though. I suspect that it will. If so, the company would likely be able to monetize AGI in several of the same ways as Alphabet, including hosting AGI apps on its Azure cloud platform. AGI could also help Nvidia make better chips. CEO Jensen Huang said earlier this year that the company's chips ""can't be designed without AI"" today. Huang, by the way, predicts that AGI could arrive within five years. Now for a reality check. It's possible that the predictions of AGI being ready in the near future could be overly optimistic. Some experts think it could be decades before we have AGI. Even Google DeepMind's Legg, who expects AGI might arrive in a few years, believes it will take decades for AGI applications to be developed across the full spectrum. In the meantime, practical issues such as premium valuations could cause one or more of these AGI stocks to underperform. Over the long run, though, if AGI achieves its potential, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Nvidia could be even bigger winners than they've been in the past. Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this: "
213,GOOG,Analysis-Google's contemplated mega deal would prompt new fight with regulators,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysis-googles-contemplated-mega-deal-100446477.html,"By Milana Vinn and Anirban Sen (Reuters) -Google parent Alphabet's contemplated acquisition of marketing software company HubSpot would likely spark opposition from regulators even as many experts agree it would not curb competition, and would require the technology giant to open a new front in its battle with antitrust watchdogs. Reuters reported last week that Google was mulling an offer for HubSpot, which has a market value of $34 billion. Google has been weighing the antitrust risks of a potential deal and has yet to decide if it will make an offer. Nearly a dozen antitrust experts and industry analysts said in interviews and analyst notes that it was unlikely that an acquisition by Google would hamper competition. They said this is because the so-called customer relationship management (CRM) software sector in which HubSpot operates is already served by several major players, including Salesforce, Adobe, Microsoft and Oracle. Google does not compete in CRM, and the acquisition could make HubSpot a more formidable player thanks to Google's cloud-computing resources, improving offerings and prices for customers, they added. According to technology researcher Gartner, HubSpot, which focuses on smaller customers, had a 4.9% market share in 2022 in the CRM marketing software industry, while Salesforce and Adobe each held a 15% share. Yet these experts also said it is very likely that a Google deal for HubSpot would trigger challenges from U.S. and European antitrust regulators, given their growing aversion to technology giants getting bigger through acquisitions. They added that Google would have to be willing to argue for the merits of the deal in a long court battle, and would need to convince HubSpot to do the same. ""My initial reaction is such a deal would face a pretty tough reception from the antitrust regulators,"" said Seth Bloom, a former general counsel of the U.S. Senate antitrust subcommittee who now runs his own advisory firm. Google and HubSpot did not respond to requests for comment. Google already faces several antitrust challenges, including two lawsuits from the United States Department of Justice. One accuses it of abusing its position as online search leader, while the other alleges it is monopolizing the market for digital advertising. A Department of Justice spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The regulatory terrain for Google is also hostile in Europe. It is among technology firms probed by the European Union for potential breaches of the new Digital Markets Act, a directive that makes it easier for people to move between competing online services like social media platforms, internet browsers and app stores. ""This transaction has not been formally notified to the Commission. If a transaction constitutes a concentration and has an EU dimension, it is always up to the companies to notify it to the Commission,"" said a spokesperson for the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, which has fined Google in the past for anticompetitive practices in online search. CASH PILE The intensity of the antitrust scrutiny has dissuaded most technology giants from pursuing mega deals. The last major acquisition completed was Microsoft's $69 billion deal to buy ""Call of Duty"" maker Activision Blizzard, which the maker of the Xbox console managed to get past Britain's regulators only after it agreed to give up streaming rights for Activision's games. In December, Adobe shelved its $20 billion deal for cloud-based designer platform Figma, citing ""no clear path"" for antitrust approvals in Europe and Britain. The regulators fretted about the ability of Figma's smaller rivals to compete. Prior to its HubSpot deliberations, Google had steered clear of large acquisitions. Its biggest-ever deal, the purchase of Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, came more than a decade ago. It has kept its dealmaking small, showing an affinity toward acquisitions in advertising with purchases such as DoubleClick and AdMob. What has pushed Google toward a big deal is its swelling cash pile of $110 billion and the need to better deploy capital to generate returns. While it is investing heavily in artificial intelligence like its peers, its shareholder returns have lagged those of other players in this space such as Microsoft and Meta Platforms over the last few months. William Kovacic, an antitrust professor at George Washington University Law School, said Google's dominance in online search tainted it in the eyes of regulators even in areas where the company does not compete, such as CRM software. ""If you slam the door shut on mergers that could permit a nonparticipant or a weaker participant to get a bigger foothold in the market, you've withdrawn an important potential source of rivalry in the market,"" Kovacic said.

On-chain analytics firm Santiment said that Bitcoin ETF volume has not slowed down since the asset’s mid-March all-time high. “It is a likely foregone conclusion that high activity should continue leading up to the April halving, but it will be interesting to see whether a drop-off in ETF volume and on-chain volume will occur directly afterwards.” Shares in Elon Musk’s EV maker were almost 4% higher in premarket trading as the company drops prices in an attempt to clear out its biggest ever inventory stockpile. Tesla is offering the deals after producing 46,561 more vehicles than it delivered in the first quarter, adding more cars to inventory than ever before. Microsoft is setting up an artificial intelligence lab in London, in the latest boost to the city as an AI hub. The company said Microsoft AI London would help drive its work in advance “state-of-the-art language models” and in creating “world-class tooling for foundation models.” Companies such as OpenAI and Anthropic have also set up offices in London in recent months amid a race for AI talent. Microsoft said it would be “actively hiring” employees to work on the most “challenging AI questions of our time” in the coming weeks and months, although did not say how many jobs would be created. Boeing shares slipped in premarket trading as the company is yet again under the spotlight for safety concerns after an engine cover fell off during take-off in Denver, US. US airline regulators have launched an investigation after the part came off and struck the wing flap. Flight 3695 — with 135 passengers and six crew members aboard — rose to about 10,300ft (3,140 metres) before returning safely 25 minutes later to Denver. ""We apologise for the inconvenience of their delay, but place our highest priority on ultimate safety for our customers and employees,"" a statement said. Boeing is overhauling its leadership amid its most significant safety crisis in years, announcing sweeping changes that included the departure of its chief executive Dave Calhoun at the end of the year.

217,GOOG,Will Google Parent Alphabet Acquire HubSpot? Not So Fast.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-parent-alphabet-acquire-hubspot-073000688.html,"While the deal makes sense on some levels, there could be hurdles to overcome if it is to come to fruition. Let's take a brief look at HubSpot's business and whether such a deal makes sense. HubSpot was founded in 2006 with the idea that shoppers didn't want to be bombarded by digital ads but rather wanted useful information upon which to make an informed choice. The company pioneered the concept of ""inbound marketing,"" which seeks to attract potential sales leads by creating helpful content in the form of social media posts, instructional videos, blog posts, and infographics designed to inform potential customers and attract them to the services a business has to offer. After becoming wildly successful with its original mandate, HubSpot sought to expand its offerings and now provides a full suite of CRM tools, focusing on the needs of small and medium-size businesses looking to scale up. The company provides an AI-powered platform that provides ""hubs"" for marketing, sales, customer service, content management, operations, and commerce. Each hub acts independently but is also deeply integrated with HubSpot's other offerings, including unified customer data, customization, and customer intelligence. Offering an integrated platform eliminates the usual hodgepodge of solutions small businesses typically endure. Alphabet's Google is the world's largest digital advertiser, so bringing an inbound marketing specialist into the fold might make sense. The company could use HubSpot's tools as another way to attract customers to Google's advertising platform, even those that might ordinarily look elsewhere. Furthermore, the combination would offer a unique alternative, providing digital advertising, inbound marketing, and CRM solutions. Providing HubSpot's services via Google Cloud would have intriguing potential. Not only would it represent a captive audience for HubSpot's CRM services, but it could also potentially act as a catalyst to drive growth for the company's cloud infrastructure service. Furthermore, HubSpot's recurring sales would be attractive to Alphabet. The CRM expert generated more than $2 billion in subscription revenue in 2023, an increase of 26%. To be clear, that's a drop in the bucket compared to Alphabet's revenue of $307 billion last year, so it certainly wouldn't move the needle. Lastly, Alphabet could certainly afford the deal. It has roughly $111 billion in cash and equivalents on its balance sheet and will likely add more with each passing quarter -- particularly as the advertising market recovers from its slump. Then there's the matter of the price tag. At the time this rumor was reported, HubSpot had a market cap of $31.76 billion, not including any premium that investors would certainly demand in order to approve such an acquisition. While the amount of the upcharge varies, the average acquisition premium paid for a company is 30%, according to a study by the accounting firm Deloitte. Tacking on a 30% premium could boost the cost for HubSpot to more than $41 billion -- a hefty price tag for any company -- and it would be Alphabet's largest acquisition ever. There is certainly a lot to consider, though I'm sure Alphabet has done its homework -- particularly in terms of valuation. HubSpot generated revenue of $2.17 billion in 2023, an increase of 25%. Wall Street expects the company to generate revenue of $2.56 billion and $3.04 billion in 2024 and 2025, respectively. That works out to a forward price-to-sales ratio of about 15, a somewhat lofty multiple. If Alphabet is truly considering buying HubSpot (and that's a big if), it must believe that it can wring much more revenue out of the company's CMS suite of tools. Given that Alphabet has the world's third-largest cloud infrastructure service, it would have a built-in target market. Investors should keep their eyes on the headlines to see if Alphabet really is interested in buying HubSpot. If it is, the company will likely pay a hefty premium. As a HubSpot shareholder, I hope this turns out to be rumor and speculation. I believe it has a long and profitable road ahead, and shareholders have more to gain if it travels that road alone.

218,GOOG,UPDATE 2-US lawmakers strike deal on data privacy legislation,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-us-lawmakers-strike-deal-210344941.html,"(Adds details of proposal, background, no immediate tech company comments, paragraphs 4-5, 7-10) By David Shepardson WASHINGTON, April 7 (Reuters) - Two key U.S. lawmakers said on Sunday they struck a deal on draft bipartisan data privacy legislation that would restrict consumer data that technology companies can collect and give Americans the power to prevent selling of personal information or compel its deletion. The agreement between Democratic Senator Maria Cantwell, who chairs the Commerce Committee, and Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers, Republican chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, would give individuals control over use of their personal information and require disclosure if data has been transferred to foreign adversaries. Congress has been debating online privacy protections since at least 2019 amid concerns about use of data by social media companies including Meta Platforms' Facebook, Alphabet's Google and ByteDance-owned TikTok, but have been unable to reach agreement. Aides told reporters on Sunday they hoped to advance legislation soon. Meta, TikTok and Google could not immediately be reached for comment. In a joint statement, the lawmakers said the plan gives the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general broad authority to oversee consumer privacy issues and establish ""robust enforcement mechanisms to hold violators accountable, including a private right of action for individuals."" The bill does not ban targeted advertising but gives consumers the ability to opt out of it. The FTC would create a new bureau focused on privacy and could issue fines for privacy violations which would also cover telecommunications companies. In 2019, Facebook agreed to pay a record-breaking $5 billion fine to resolve an FTC probe into its privacy practices, triggered by allegations Facebook violated a 2012 consent decree. The FTC now wants to tighten that existing privacy settlement to ban profiting from minors' data and expand curbs on facial-recognition technology. In 2021, ByteDance agreed to a $92 million class-action settlement regarding data privacy claims from some U.S. TikTok users. Reuters reported last month that the FTC could soon resolve its investigation into TikTok over allegedly faulty privacy and data security practices. Google and its YouTube unit in 2019 paid $170 million in a settlement with the FTC and New York to resolve allegations it broke federal law by collecting personal information about children. U.S. lawmakers Cantwell and Rodgers added: ""This bipartisan, bicameral draft legislation is the best opportunity we’ve had in decades to establish a national data privacy and security standard that gives people the right to control their personal information."" The measure would allow people to opt out of data processing if a company changes its privacy policy. It requires ""affirmative express consent before sensitive data can be transferred to a third party."" Consumers could sue ""bad actors who violate their privacy rights - and recover money for damages when they’ve been harmed"" and would stop ""companies from using people’s personal information to discriminate against them,"" the statement said. The bill would require ""annual reviews of algorithms to ensure they do not put individuals, including our youth, at risk of harm, including discrimination.""

219,GOOG,"Following Its Highly Anticipated IPO, Reality May Already Be Setting in for Reddit Stock. 3 Things Smart Investors Should Know.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/following-highly-anticipated-ipo-reality-184000109.html,"Unsurprisingly, some businesses are taking advantage of the ripe market conditions as 2024 has featured a number of high-profile initial public offerings (IPO). Prospective Reddit investors should understand the major risk areas for the company and how they can affect its long-term outlook. This makes sense from a business perspective. If you can attract more users to your platform, then you have a bigger monetization opportunity. And the most common way to monetize users on social media is through advertising. With 73 million daily active users, Reddit clearly has some brand appeal. Moreover, in 2023, the company generated $804 million in revenue -- up 21% year over year. Similar to its competitors, Reddit's primary source of revenue stems from advertising. Meta Platforms owns Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp, which combine for over 3 billion daily active users. Meanwhile, Alphabet is home to the world's most visited websites -- Google and YouTube -- with over 100 billion site visits each month. But the company's plan to grow beyond the typical advertising business model is puzzling, and even more concerning, it's very much unproven. In Reddit's S-1 filing, the company describes two other areas it's exploring as revenue opportunities: e-commerce and artificial intelligence (AI). E-commerce can complement Reddit's existing advertising operation. However, the intersection of Reddit's specific brand of social media and e-commerce can be a challenge given existing players in the space. Meta has been able to penetrate e-commerce successfully thanks to the rise of small businesses on Instagram as well as the marketplace on Facebook. But while smaller platforms like Snap are also experimenting with e-commerce, their success has been much more limited. Average revenue per user has continued to trend lower for Snap, hinting at the challenges for social media companies looking to expand their sources of revenue. Given Reddit's vast library of user data, there is merit to the idea the platform's content can be scraped to help train generative AI models. However, the risk here is that those same models could eventually poach the company's user base and engagement as people turn to AI for the discussion and answers they previously sought on Reddit. Reddit has a market capitalization of $7.5 billion as of this writing, putting its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio at about 9.3. That matches Meta's P/S ratio, while coming in higher than the likes of Pinterest and Snap. This premium valuation is hard to justify given the question marks surrounding its growth prospects. Andrew Freedman, an analyst at Hedgeye Risk Management, recently called the stock ""grossly overvalued"" in a short report published last week, according to Bloomberg. Freedman believes the stock will retreat closer to its IPO price of $34 per share, which would benefit short sellers who profit when a stock's price falls. Once Reddit begins hosting earnings calls, investors will learn how much success the company is having with its pursuits in e-commerce and AI. But for now, I'd steer clear of Reddit and let the current hype surrounding the stock play out. There are other opportunities in social media from larger, more established businesses. Before you buy stock in Reddit, consider this: "
220,GOOG,"""Big Short"" Investor Michael Burry Has 10% of His Portfolio in 2 ""Magnificent Seven"" AI Stocks",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-short-investor-michael-burry-121000441.html,"So why did Burry open positions in Amazon and Alphabet? Had Amazon been earning a 7.5% profit margin for the entire year on its total revenue of $575 billion, it would have generated $43 billion in profits in 2023. Against its current market cap of $1.9 trillion, that would have given it a P/E of 44. But even this doesn't tell the full story. Amazon's profit margins should continue to move higher in 2024, for multiple reasons. First, its high-margin cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services (AWS), continues to shine. Second, it is seeing strong growth from higher-margin e-commerce services such as third-party selling management and advertising. Advertising revenues, for reference, grew by 26% year over year last quarter. If Amazon's profit margin reaches 10% in 2024 and its revenue grows by 10% to $630 billion, it will generate $63 billion in earnings this year. That would give it a P/E of 30, or right around the S&P 500's average. Burry likely anticipates that profit inflection happening as well, which would explain why he is buying shares for Scion Asset Management's portfolio. Burry's other Magnificent Seven bet, Alphabet, is not optically expensive, but it faced some major negative narratives throughout 2023. At the beginning of 2023, the tech giant traded at a P/E ratio below 15, likely due to investor fears that it was losing the race in AI to upstarts such as OpenAI. Today, it trades at a P/E of 27, which is still slightly below the S&P 500 average, even though the stock is up 77% year to date. Burry and other investors likely expect Alphabet to maintain its overwhelming share of the search market, which gives it a lucrative digital advertising business. Google Search's market share has remained remarkably steady despite all these new AI competitors, at over 90% according to the latest estimates. In the fourth quarter of 2023, Google Search revenue grew 12.7% year over year to $48 billion. Alphabet also has promising businesses in YouTube and Google Cloud. YouTube is the dominant player in video streaming worldwide, generating $9.2 billion in advertising revenue last quarter and hitting 100 million premium subscribers. Google Cloud does right around the same in quarterly revenue and is growing sales by 25% year over year. If Alphabet maintains its lead in Google Search and keeps growing YouTube and Google Cloud, the stock will likely do well over the long term. Looking through the portfolio holdings of famous investors can be insightful. But nobody should be out there blindly buying up every company in Burry's portfolio. First off, we outsiders can't know what Burry's actual theses are on these two stocks. His reasons for holding them may differ from your own, and that could create some discomfort for you if the stocks start falling. Second, the investing public only finds out about hedge funds' moves through their 13-F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These filings are due a month and a half after the end of the quarter they cover, and the most recent ones describe where their portfolios stood at the end of 2023. As such, we can have no idea if Burry has bought or sold Amazon and Alphabet shares in 2024, or if he even has any exposure to the stocks right now. This informational time lag makes trying to copy the moves of famous investors a dangerous idea. Learn from the investing greats, but don't copy them. It's better to build your portfolio with stocks you believe in, not stocks you believe that others believe in. Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this: "

222,GOOG,"Meet the Best-Performing ""Magnificent Seven"" Stock Over the Last Month (Hint: It's Not Nvidia)",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meet-best-performing-magnificent-seven-114500442.html,"However, something has changed over the last month. One of the three Magnificent Seven stocks that had been down year to date is suddenly up -- a lot -- over the last month. It has been a wild ride for Alphabet stock in 2024. In late January, it was around the same price it is today -- above $150 a share. But in early March, it fell to the low $130 per-share range due to investor pessimism regarding its artificial intelligence (AI) investments -- specifically, Google Gemini AI and its inaccuracies. Partnering with Apple would be a huge deal for Alphabet. Despite owning various differentiated businesses, like Google Search, YouTube, Google Cloud, and Android, Alphabet still depends on ads for the vast majority of its revenue. The more it can diversify its business away from ads, the wider its moat and the more levers it can pull to unlock growth. At least in the short term, Alphabet stock has moved in and out of favor with Wall Street based on its perceived AI aptitude and potential. In reality, this is a company that has been monetizing AI for some time and has a massive research and development budget and cash to invest in innovation. With so many growth narratives flooding the market, it can be easy to get caught up in implied-growth trajectories and overlook the companies that have already accomplished so much and are earning a ton of profit. In other words, outweighing the unknown and discounting proven winners. Alphabet is a proven winner, but there are question marks surrounding how it will stay a winner in the midst of so much competition. Android is still the dominant operating system globally, but iOS is bigger in core areas like the U.S., and Apple has more control over its hardware and software integration than Alphabet. The glass-half-empty outlook on Alphabet is that it is a market leader across many different industries but that all of its industries are ripe for disruption. It has been the leader in search for decades, but can it maintain pole position in the face of mounting competition from short-video platforms or new competition remains to be seen? Consumers have more entertainment options than ever, so will YouTube lose market share to other streaming sites? Will Google Cloud be able to take market share against its larger peers? These are all valid questions. When you like a company, it's always good to consider the counterargument. Charlie Munger used to talk about the inversion process as a way to expand a line of thinking. Before buying a stock, we usually think about the reasons why the company is a good investment. But inversion would involve thinking about all the reasons why folks would want to sell the stock, why it could go lower, underperform the market, etc. There's usually a halfway decent counterargument to even the best stocks. But sometimes, even bad counterarguments can become dominant market sentiment if the market is pessimistic on a stock as it had been on Alphabet relative to the rest of the Magnificent Seven. Alphabet has an established, cash-cow business model and plenty of ways to monetize AI. It is no stranger to competition, as there are always other companies that want a slice of a high-margin industry. In Alphabet's favor is its inexpensive valuation. It has a mere 26.7 price-to-earnings ratio, slightly above Apple's 26.3 for the second-lowest of the Magnificent Seven stocks. It also has a 28.8 price-to-free-cash-flow (FCF) ratio, also second-lowest behind Apple in the Magnificent Seven. Alphabet may not be the most exciting growth stock out there right now. But what it does have is a profitable business and room to take risks and unlock growth. Alphabet's deep pockets and track record of innovation are reason enough for the stock to not trade at a discount to the S&P 500 (like it does today). Alphabet stock should have never fallen as much as it did. And even now, it looks like a reasonable long-term buy for patient investors. Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this: "
223,GOOG,"Forget Nvidia: Here Are 3 ""Magnificent Seven"" Stocks Wall Street Thinks Will Soar More",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/forget-nvidia-3-magnificent-seven-094500601.html,"It might be surprising that Wall Street is so optimistic about Apple. The tech giant's sales growth has slowed considerably, and its valuation is relatively high, with shares trading at a forward earnings multiple of nearly 26. Wall Street thinks Amazon can move even higher. The consensus price target for the stock is roughly 6.5% above the current share price. Forty-three of the 47 analysts surveyed by LSEG in April rate Amazon as a buy or a strong buy. Generative AI continues to provide a major tailwind for Amazon Web Services (AWS), as customers like to run apps where their data is. Since AWS commands the leading market share among cloud platforms, it's where many organizations are training and deploying their generative AI apps. Amazon's advertising business is also enjoying strong momentum. The company is using AI to boost the relevancy of the ads displayed to customers. It has also expanded advertising on Prime Video. The average analyst's 12-month price target is nearly 6% higher than the current price. Wall Street is overwhelmingly bullish about the tech stock, with 38 of the 43 analysts surveyed by LSEG in April rating Alphabet as a buy or a strong buy. Alphabet's Google unit has experienced a couple of embarrassments with its generative AI apps -- first, with Bard last year, and more recently, with Gemini earlier this year. However, these missteps don't seem to have concerned analysts very much. They're more focused on the growth opportunities for Google Cloud and Google's continued dominance in search. Some also have great long-term expectations for Alphabet's Waymo self-driving car business. You can't depend on Wall Street's price targets. Even highly paid analysts focused on scrutinizing companies' operations can't predict the future with a high level of accuracy. However, I suspect Wall Street could be right about Apple, Amazon, and Alphabet. They could be right about Nvidia, too. Nvidia could continue to soar higher, but competition is increasing. Any hiccup could cause the stock to tumble. I think Apple's shares could jump on good news at the upcoming developer conference. Amazon and Alphabet should deliver solid growth in the next few quarters, largely due to the generative AI tailwinds. Wall Street isn't always right. In this case, though, I agree with the analysts' takes on these Magnificent Seven stocks. Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this: "

225,GOOG,2 Superb Growth Stocks to Buy in Today's Bull Market,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-superb-growth-stocks-buy-073500075.html,"Investors have been eager for a new bull market, and when multiple indexes high new all-time highs in early 2024, they got final confirmations that new bull markets were well underway. While not all stocks are fully contributing to the growth of today's bull market at the moment, companies with wide moats and demonstrable financial strength are steadily making their way to the top. If you're looking for two superb growth stocks to scoop up in the wake of this current bull market, here are two names you won't want to overlook. In the full year 2023, Alphabet brought in total revenue of about $307 billion while net income came to approximately $74 billion. Those two figures represented increases of 9% and 23%, respectively, from 2022. Digital advertising through Google Search still accounts for the lion's share of the company's revenue. Case in point: Alphabet brought in fourth-quarter revenue of $86 billion, about $48 billion of which came from the Google search engine. A combination of unfavorable comparisons in revenue and user growth to the heightened pandemic period, along with a general slowdown in these areas, also dampened investor enthusiasm about the business. And, the challenging economic landscape has caused companies to be more cautious with where they put advertising dollars, a trend that Pinterest can't control but which will recover slowly as macro conditions improve. Pinterest's free-to-use website and mobile app provide millions of users all over the world with inspiration on everything from recipes to travel to home decor, but these platforms are also a prime source of advertising space for brands. The company makes money by selling ad space to merchants across a range of industries and placing those ads in the forms of videos and images among the rest of the ""pins"" that users peruse to look for inspiration on any given topic. As of the end of 2023, Pinterest had 498 million monthly active users around the globe, a solid increase of 11% compared to the end of 2022. Revenue for the year totaled $3 billion, up 9% from 2022. Globally, average revenue per user (ARPU) rose just 1% in the 12-month period. However, broken down by region, ARPU rose 5% in the U.S. and Canada, 15% in Europe, and 17% in the rest of the world last year. While the company reported a net loss for the year on the basis of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), it reported positive net income in both the third and fourth quarters of 2023: $7 million and $201 million, respectively. The company seems to be inching back to a healthy level of growth after a series of bumpy financial reports, and investors have taken notice.

228,GOOG,"After Soaring 178%, Reality May Be Setting in for SoundHound AI",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/soaring-178-reality-may-setting-152800860.html,"Have you ever witnessed a magician do a trick only to ask, ""how did they do that?"" Magic is interesting because even though you know what you're witnessing is merely an illusion, oftentimes you find yourself actually believing it. Over the last year, the world has been captivated by the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). With chatbots, self-driving cars, and humanoid robots, AI almost seems magical -- except this time it's real. Investors have been eager to buy into just about anything powered by AI, but not all opportunities are created equal. One research firm is not impressed with SoundHound AI, and I think it has raised some legitimate concerns. Let's dig into a freshly published short report by Capybara Research, and assess why an investment in SoundHound AI carries outsize risk compared to other opportunities in the artificial intelligence (AI) realm. AI-powered speech recognition is an interesting component of the overall AI narrative. Whether you realize it or not, you actually interact with this technology fairly often. When I reviewed SoundHound's fourth-quarter and full-year 2023 earnings report a few weeks ago, I noticed something. Management used to include a key performance metric called ""cumulative bookings backlog"" -- a figure that was meant to provide investors with a glimpse of future revenue commitments. However, in the fourth-quarter report this metric was updated to be called ""cumulative subscription and bookings backlog."" While this subtle change in verbiage may seem harmless, management's commentary is what raised my eyebrows. CFO Nitesh Sharan said that this metric represents bookings backlog plus ""new subscription revenue streams that we are focused on."" This is vague, at best. Sharan went on to say that ""subscription backlog takes into account customers where we are the leading or exclusive provider and assumes a four-year ramp to fully scale with a total five-year duration."" So management is forecasting future revenue that may not be fully committed yet. SoundHound AI has reported some encouraging financial results in recent quarters. In fact, the company reported record revenue in Q4. However, Capybara's research report included an interesting detail surrounding the company's financials. Specifically, the report leveraged footnotes from SoundHound AI's regulatory filings to uncover that the company is using one-time payments from terminated contracts to inflate revenue and margins in any given quarter. In other words, if a customer churns, SoundHound AI pulls termination fees forward. These are non-recurring sources of sales, but they appear as if revenue is experiencing upward momentum. This accounting maneuver combined with the vagueness of the new cumulative subscription and bookings backlog metric makes me wary. Capybara ended its report by putting a $1 price target on SoundHound AI stock -- it closed March 28 at $5.89. I cannot say with any real certainty if that is where SoundHound AI stock is headed, but what I can say is that the company will need more than new metrics and it will need to prove that it can organically grow revenue as opposed to using an accounting device to accelerate its top-line profile. If SoundHound AI fails to execute, liquidity will become an even bigger risk factor considering the company is still losing money and has only recently managed to reduce cash burn by laying off employees. For now, I'd steer clear of SoundHound AI stock. The company represents an interesting opportunity, but with shares soaring to levels disconnected from the fundamentals of the business, investors are better off pursuing proven, established players in the AI industry. Before you buy stock in SoundHound AI, consider this: "
229,GOOG,Veteran analyst unveils Google stock price 'line in the sand',https://finance.yahoo.com/news/veteran-analyst-unveils-google-stock-113300127.html,"Google is a search engine giant; however, the recent rally in its parent company, Alphabet, has been driven more by its artificial intelligence opportunity than traditional search. The company's Google Cloud is experiencing tailwinds from enterprise customers' AI research and development efforts, and Alphabet's large-language models could one day reshape its core search market. AI undeniably changes how businesses and people consume and interact with information. Still, given recent returns, Google investors can't be blamed for wondering how much of the opportunity is already priced in and when the rally could end. To help answer that question, TheStreet's Bruce Kamich, who has analyzed stocks professionally for over 50 years, recently updated his analysis of Alphabet's stock, including a new price point that could cause investors to get uneasy. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Alphabet arguably possesses one of the most expansive data troves in the world. Its 90% market share in the search engine market and top-three ranking in the cloud service provider market means it knows a thing or two about managing and interpreting information. Advantages stemming from its vast computing power and data experience position it perfectly to benefit from strengthening AI tailwinds since the successful launch of Open AI's ChatGPT in December 2022. After ChatGPT became the fastest app to eclipse 1 million users, businesses have scrambled to create and implement AI strategies. Seemingly, everyone is knee-deep in training and running AI programs, and Alphabet hasn't lost sight of that fact. ""I believe the transition we are seeing right now with AI will be the most profound in our lifetimes, far bigger than the shift to mobile or to the web before it,"" said CEO Sundar Pichai in December. ""This new era of models represents one of the biggest science and engineering efforts we’ve undertaken as a company."" Individuals use Gemini to discover and create increasingly relevant insight, and businesses use Gemini-powered tools to accelerate their AI R&D programs on Google Cloud. As a result, Google's search market share has barely budged despite Microsoft's threat. According to Similarweb, over the past six months, ChatGPT and Microsoft search and AI chatbot search market share has only increased by 0.32% and 0.14% to 1.84% and 1.44%, respectively. Google’s market share outside China has remained at almost 92%. Google's Search & Other business segment sales increased 12.7% year-over-year to $48 billion, and YouTube ads jumped 15.6% to $9.2 billion in the fourth quarter. Across all its businesses, Alphabet's total revenue was $86 billion that quarter, up 13% from a year ago. Its profit climbed 42% to $1.61 per share – its second-consecutive quarter of above 40% earnings growth. The AI revolution is far from over, so it's too soon to pick winners and losers. Nevertheless, Wedbush Securities analysts recently suggested that worrying about a search shift away from Google is off the mark. Wedbush's analysis showed that Google AI search results included a similar number of ads to traditional search. For now, the placement is above or below the result. However, they expect ads within the results over time, improving advertising revenue opportunities. ""We think Google remains a clear generative AI beneficiary,"" wrote Wedbush. Bruce Kamich is a technical analyst who has used price, volume, and technical analysis indicators for five decades for insight into individual stocks and major markets. ""Shouldn't we buy new highs? Many times the answer is yes but sometimes the answer could be no,"" said Kamich. ""The two most recent candles are spinning tops with small real bodies. On a bar chart we would call this two inside days but the candles suggest a balance between bulls and bears. This balance could be easily upset with a bearish or red candle in the near future."" Kamich states, ""The weekly [On-balance volume] OBV line is stalled and the MACD oscillator has been correcting for months."" He also notes, ""The 12-day momentum study has been weakening since the middle of March."" On-balance volume is essentially up minus down-day volume. MACD is a momentum indicator. The potential warning signs make him uneasy about Alphabet stock despite daily and weekly P&F chart price targets of $190 and $204. Since Alphabet shares currently trade around $153, those targets suggest significant upside potential. However, P&F targets shift based on price action. If Alphabet shares dip below $150, Kamich said those targets may fall. As a result, Kamich concludes, ""A close below $150 could be the start of a downside move in GOOGL,"" suggesting investors may want to consider that an important line in the sand. "
230,GOOG,Is Now The Time To Put Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) On Your Watchlist?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/now-time-put-alphabet-nasdaq-110058368.html,"For beginners, it can seem like a good idea (and an exciting prospect) to buy a company that tells a good story to investors, even if it currently lacks a track record of revenue and profit. But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up. The market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. It certainly is nice to see that Alphabet has managed to grow EPS by 26% per year over three years. If the company can sustain that sort of growth, we'd expect shareholders to come away satisfied. Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. The music to the ears of Alphabet shareholders is that EBIT margins have grown from 26% to 29% in the last 12 months and revenues are on an upwards trend as well. Ticking those two boxes is a good sign of growth, in our book. In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. For finer detail, click on the image. Owing to the size of Alphabet, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$194b. This suggests that leadership will be very mindful of shareholders' interests when making decisions! "

232,GOOG,"Here's the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock I Think Will Be the Next to Join Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta in the $1 Trillion Club",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-artificial-intelligence-ai-stock-094500701.html,"Few groups are as exclusive as the $1 trillion club. This club has only six members, each a U.S. company with a market capitalization of at least $1 trillion. However, the $1 trillion mark isn't out of reach for Broadcom. The semiconductor and infrastructure software maker's market cap currently tops $610 billion. Sure, the stock needs to jump another 64% or so. But considering Broadcom's shares have more than doubled over the last 12 months, delivering the required gain to join the $1 trillion club doesn't seem too tall a task. Competition in China has intensified, causing Tesla to cut prices to avoid being outflanked. Big automakers in the U.S. are ramping up their EV production. Perhaps most concerning is that consumer interest in buying EVs seems to have stalled. I suspect Taiwan Semi presents a greater threat to beat Broadcom to $1 trillion. The semiconductor maker's market cap is close to $620 billion, neck and neck with Broadcom's. Both companies should benefit from a strong continued demand for chips to power AI applications. However, several rivals are attempting to reduce Taiwan Semi's market dominance. Mainland China's ambition to retake Taiwan could negatively impact Taiwan Semi stock as well as push U.S. and European customers to competitors. Broadcom's risks seem relatively minor compared to those of Taiwan Semi. The company's acquisition of VMware should fuel accelerated growth. Broadcom's main problem is declining broadband sales and telecommunications companies reducing their spending. Since I predict that Broadcom will be the next AI stock to join the $1 trillion club, do I also view the stock as a buy right now? Actually, no. My concern with Broadcom is its valuation. Shares trade at nearly 29 times forward earnings. Yes, the company should generate strong growth over the next few years. Unfortunately, Broadcom's price still isn't compelling to me even with that growth factored in.

In recent years, investors piled on companies' stocks merely because they grew cannabis or became meme stocks. However, thanks to high-gross margins, Nvidia has become tremendously profitable. At a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of around 75, it may look like a bargain, considering that its net income rose 769% in fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 31). The increases should continue for the foreseeable future. According to MarketDigits, analysts forecast a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for the AI chip market of 38% through 2030. With Nvidia having at least 80% of this market, according to analysts, it will probably claim the lion's share of that benefit. Nonetheless, AI is likely here to stay, and as long as Nvidia retains its leadership position, the stock should continue driving significant returns even when AI is no longer trendy. Still, the company appears to have taken AI to the next level with the release of its artificial intelligence platform (AIP). AIP applies generative AI to its capabilities, and prospective customers have reported eye-popping productivity gains. One prospective customer boasted of accomplishing more in one day than a hyperscaler had in four months. Another reported accomplishing 10 times as much with three-times fewer resources. Such productivity gains will likely make Palantir AIP essential to numerous companies, giving the company tremendous market power. Admittedly, Palantir's market cap of about $50 billion makes it a fraction of the size of many tech giants promoting AI. However, the company has remained profitable since the final quarter of 2022, dramatically reducing the need for outside funding. Also, since it only became profitable recently, its P/E ratio is above 250, though on a forward basis, it sells at a forward P/E ratio of 71. Even though that still makes the stock expensive, Palantir's productivity gains and the potential growth that comes with those gains are likely too rewarding to ignore. Still, Alphabet has responded with the release of Gemini, its own generative AI platform. Moreover, investors should not forget that Alphabet infuses AI into every product, and it recently combined its research efforts into Google DeepMind to help stay on the leading edge of AI technology. Additionally, the company holds around $111 billion in cash and equivalents, an amount of liquidity matched by few companies. Thus, if it cannot develop the needed technology in-house, it can probably gain it through acquisition. After recent struggles, the company has returned to profit growth, and with a P/E ratio of 26, it has the lowest earnings multiple of any stock in the ""Magnificent Seven."" That factor could draw investors into Alphabet stock as it continues to innovate in the AI space. Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this: "
234,GOOG,Could The Trade Desk Become the Next Alphabet?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/could-trade-desk-become-next-073500085.html,"The digital advertising market is split into sell-side platforms (SSPs), which help publishers sell their own ad inventories, and demand-side platforms (DSPs), which help advertisers automatically purchase ad space across a wide range of platforms. Those walled gardens make it hard for advertisers to reach websites and apps across the ""open internet"" that isn't directly tethered to Alphabet or Meta. To crack open those walled gardens, more independent SSPs and DSPs emerged. The Trade Desk went public in September 2016. From 2016 to 2023, its revenue grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 46%, its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) increased at a CAGR of 51%, and its adjusted EBITDA margin expanded from 32% to 40%. It generated $1.95 billion in revenue in 2023, which is comparable to Alphabet's pre-IPO revenue of $1.5 billion back in 2003. Over the following 20 years, Alphabet's revenue grew at a CAGR of 30% and reached $307.4 billion in 2023. Analysts expect The Trade Desk's revenue to grow at a CAGR of 21% from 2023 to 2026 as its adjusted EBITDA increases at a CAGR of 27%. Those growth rates are impressive, but it could struggle to match Alphabet's growth trajectory. The main difference is that Google's core search engine and YouTube were disruptive consumer-facing platforms, while The Trade Desk operates behind the scenes. Google benefited from the secular growth of the search, streaming video, and mobile markets over the past two decades, but The Trade Desk arguably lacks those fiery growth engines. It's still too early to tell if The Trade Desk, which has a market cap of $43 billion, will ever evolve into a trillion-dollar tech giant like Alphabet. Its stock also isn't cheap at 18 times this year's sales and 43 times its adjusted EBITDA. That said, The Trade Desk is still growing faster than Alphabet, which is only expected to grow its revenue at a CAGR of 11% over the next three years. Therefore, The Trade Desk could be a much better choice for growth investors over the next few years, even if it doesn't come close to matching Alphabet's jaw-dropping gains from the past two decades.

237,GOOG,Elon Musk announces Tesla will unveil a ‘robotaxi’ on August 8,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/elon-musk-announces-tesla-unveil-230113492.html,"Elon Musk has long had an affinity for self-driving vehicles, claiming they will be one of Tesla’s most important products. Despite big promise s, years have gone by without cars that can, so far, drive on their own. But Musk, on a Friday afternoon, when companies tend to bury news, announced on X that Tesla would unveil its robotaxi on August 8. His post was simple and included no details. “Tesla Robotaxi unveil on 8/8,” the Tesla CEO (and owner of X) posted. Musk has said in the past that Tesla will make a car without controls for a human to use. He has also said in the past that Tesla cars equipped with Full Self-Driving Capability will, through software updates, gradually become better and better at driving. At some point, the cars will be capable of operating as fully autonomous taxis and could earn money for their owners by giving taxi rides on their own, Musk has repeatedly said. So far, the company has passed several of Musk’s predictions for when actual self-driving would be possible. But Musk also acknowledged that his track record for predictions can be off – sometimes by a mile. “The only criticism and it’s a fair one, sometimes I’m not on time. But I get it done and the Tesla team gets it done,” Musk said at the April 2019 event. Currently, Full Self-Driving capability can be purchased with a new Tesla Model 3, for instance, for an additional $12,000 added to the car’s roughly $40,000 purchase price. It can be also be purchased on a subscription basis for up to $199 a month, depending on how the car was originally equipped. In small gray type, Tesla’s on-line description points out, “The currently enabled features require active driver supervision and do not make the vehicle autonomous,” meaning that it is not, in fact, capable of fully self-driving today. Musk has said the system will one day make Tesla cars incredibly valuable. “You can think of every car we sell or produce that has full autonomy capability as something that in the future may be worth five times what it is today,” he said in the company’s earnings call for the third quarter last year. Experts who have tested the system say that, as of now, it is still far from being able to drive on its own without human intervention. Kelly Funkhouser, associate director of vehicle technology for Consumer Reports, recently tested the system and said she’s less worried about its safety than she is about ordinary Tesla Autopilot, which is designed to provide more limited driving assistance mainly on highways. Ironically, that’s because the Full Self-Driving technology performs so poorly. Funkhouser described it as like giving control of your car to a novice teen driver. “You’re not likely to tune out and become complacent or over-reliant on it,” she said. “In fact, I would say you’re potentially more alert.” A number of companies, including Waymo, a subsidiary of Google’s parent company Alphabet, as well as GM subsidiary Cruise, are working on autonomous ride-sharing services.

238,GOOG,11 Best Technology Penny Stocks To Invest In Now,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/11-best-technology-penny-stocks-200912104.html,"Yet another stronger-than-expected jobs report published on Friday is further dampening investors’ hopes of seeing the first rate cut from the Federal Reserve in June. Analysts have started to predict that the Federal Reserve might further delay its first rate cut to avoid seeing a strong rebound in inflation down the road. Piper Sandler said in its fresh note that latest data is showing the US labor market is “even stronger than we thought and maybe getting stronger.” Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial in Troy, Michigan, also said in a note that investors are beginning to digest the possibility of not seeing three rate cuts this year. He thinks the Fed could cut rates twice this year, but it’s still early to say anything. ""If the economy is running the way it's running now through most of this year, then it might be likely that the Fed does not cut interest rates this year,” Saglimbene added. “High-quality small cap companies have delivered stronger returns than the small cap universe, with lower volatility. Since 1976, small cap quality has outperformed the small cap asset class in the U.S. by 1.8% annualized and has also outperformed the all-cap U.S. market by 2.8% annualized. These more predictable, long-term winners are very often undervalued by the market, buried under the buzz of stocks long on narrative but short on fundamental stability.” But how have small-cap and micro-cap stocks been performing this year? Invesco S&P SmallCap Information Technology ETF (PSCT), which invests in small-cap technology stocks, is up just 5.80% over the past one year, compared to the S&P 500’s return of 27%. So far this year, the ETF is down 3.56%. But artificial intelligence is doing its wonders in the small-cap space too, since smaller names like Super Micro and MicroStrategy, part of the small-cap focused Russell 2000, poste huge returns on the back of the AI wave. A recent Wall Street Journal report said, citing data from LSEG, that these two companies collectively accounted for about a third of the Russell 2000’s 5.2% return in the first quarter.

It's obviously something Pichai worries about. He didn't offer any specific tactics that have proven successful at Google, but instead noted how difficult it is to create the proper incentives. He hearkened back to an earlier time in which Google was more willing to take weird risks, in particularly pointing to the firm's ill-fated Google Glass; it didn't work out, but it was one of the first devices to experiment with augmented reality.

242,GOOG,The CEO leading ‘Korea’s Google’ in its battle against Big Tech,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ceo-leading-korea-google-battle-190000926.html,"As of September 2023, Naver controlled 59% of Korea’s search market to Google’s 31%. Naver is hardly a household name outside Korea. But it operates a sprawling portfolio that pits the $22-billion-in-market-cap firm against other Big Tech giants on multiple fronts. Naver is perhaps “the only company in the world that has survived competition against Google and Amazon.” In recent quarters, Naver’s many business lines have notched record revenues and operating profits, but Choi sees Naver’s mission as extending beyond its own bottom line. Despite Naver’s small size, she casts the firm as a counterpoint in a global tech scene in which power is concentrated among a gargantuan few. “It’s becoming a world where there are only one or two search companies and one or two commerce companies,” Choi said in a recent wide-ranging interview—her first with the international press—at Naver headquarters in Seongnam, just outside Seoul. (Choi gave her answers in Korean, which were later translated into English.) Naver “is a company that constantly fights against such a world and strives to preserve diversity,” she says. Investors question whether Naver can go toe-to-toe with cash-rich rivals. Still, Choi’s goal is ambitious—perhaps even noble—and belies the role she was appointed to fill: that of a caretaker CEO brought on to steady a company in turmoil. Choi, 42, was an unconventional pick to run the company. A Harvard-educated M&A lawyer, she joined Naver in 2019 as head of global business support to help lead the firm’s expansion. Three years later, the board named Choi as CEO to show it was prepared to overhaul its culture after a series of crises. “There was a lack of trust in the systems, leadership, and board,” Choi says of Naver’s previous culture. One big change Choi made was to reintroduce remote work, a rarity in post-COVID South Korea. The option gives employees “the choice of what kind of working environment they can be most productive and create the most innovation in.” Naver and fellow internet firm Kakao (founded by an ex-Naver executive) have made South Korea one of a handful of countries where homegrown search engines outperform U.S. search giants without government intervention. Naver earned 9.6 trillion won ($7.41 billion) in revenue in 2023, a record. Search and e-commerce generated 37% and 26% of sales, respectively. It made $1.3 billion in operating profit, also a record. Yet shares are currently trading about 60% below a COVID-era high. Investors are concerned about slowing revenue from search (up 0.6% in 2023), plummeting revenue from display ads (down 10% last year), and the lack of a “punchy, clear growth strategy,” Suh says. Naver’s lack of a punchy, clear growth strategy is especially worrisome in the AI age, when Naver faces U.S. companies that are investing billions in the technology. As U.S. giants dominate English-based AI, Naver may be able to establish an edge in systems based in Korean and other languages, Choi says. Choi is especially interested in what she calls “sovereign AI,” or a model that’s tailored to an individual user. “We focus on what companies and governments that want to use AI would want, and what needs Big Tech can’t fulfill,” she says. As AI becomes more common, “each group will need an AI model that best understands” its unique traits. At the same time, she also sees room for a traditional search engine—with its list of links to choose from—amid the generative AI revolution. “Not all questions in the world have a single correct answer,” she says. “There is still a need for exploration.” Choi, whose CEO contract expires in 2025, expresses some unease at often being a “sole woman” in business: “Simply because I am a woman, there are expectations for me to demonstrate skills such as effective communication, adept conflict resolution, and the ability to nurture people.” “I’m not alone anymore!” Choi says. "
243,GOOG,YouTube Says OpenAI Training Sora With Its Videos Would Break Rules,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/youtube-says-openai-training-sora-185454534.html,"(Bloomberg) -- The use of YouTube videos to train OpenAI’s text-to-video generator would be an infraction of the platform's terms of service, YouTube Chief Executive Officer Neal Mohan said. Most Read from Bloomberg In his first public remarks on the topic, Mohan said he had no firsthand knowledge of whether OpenAI had, in fact, used YouTube videos to refine its artificial intelligence-powered video creation tool, called Sora. But if that were the case, it would be a “clear violation” of YouTube’s terms of use, he said. “From a creator’s perspective, when a creator uploads their hard work to our platform, they have certain expectations,” Mohan said earlier this week in an interview with Emily Chang, host of Bloomberg Originals. “One of those expectations is that the terms of service is going to be abided by. It does not allow for things like transcripts or video bits to be downloaded, and that is a clear violation of our terms of service. Those are the rules of the road in terms of content on our platform.” There has been much public debate over what material OpenAI uses to train the AI models underlying popular content creation products such as ChatGPT and DALL-E. Sora and other generative AI tools work by sucking up all sorts of content from around the web and using that data as the foundation from which the tools can generate new content, including videos, photos, narrative text and more. As companies like OpenAI, Google and others race to develop more powerful artificial intelligence, they are looking to source as much content as possible to train their AI models to get better quality results. Google and YouTube are units of Alphabet Inc. OpenAI, which is backed by Microsoft Corp., didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. OpenAI Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal last month that she wasn’t sure whether Sora was trained on user-generated videos from YouTube, Facebook and Instagram. The Journal reported this week that OpenAI has discussed training its next-generation large language model, GPT-5, on transcriptions of public YouTube videos, citing people familiar with the matter. Mohan said Google adheres to YouTube’s individual contracts with creators before deciding whether to use videos from the platform in training the company’s own powerful AI model, Gemini. “Lots of creators have different sorts of licensing contracts in terms of their content on our platform,” Mohan said. Though “some portion of that YouTube corpus maybe being used” to train models like Gemini, Google and YouTube ensure that using the videos as training data for Google’s AI is “in concert with whatever the terms of service or the contract that that creator has signed” beforehand, he said.

244,GOOG,Summers Says Hot Jobs Data Show Neutral Fed Rate ‘Much Higher’,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/summers-says-hot-jobs-data-161406739.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said that the surge in US payrolls in March illustrates that the Federal Reserve is well off in its estimate of where the neutral interest rate is, and cautioned against any move to lower rates in June. Most Read from Bloomberg “This was a hot report that suggested that, if anything, the economy is re-accelerating,” Summers said on Bloomberg Television’s Wall Street Week with David Westin. Alongside other factors including an “epic” loosening in financial conditions, “it seems to me the evidence is overwhelming that the neutral rate is far higher than the Fed supposes,” he said. The neutral rate is the theoretical level for the Fed’s benchmark that neither stimulates nor restrains growth. Fed policymakers last month estimated it at around 2.6% — the median estimate of their forecasts. Summers reiterated his own view is that neutral is 4% or higher. That compares with the current target range of 5.25% to 5.5%. “There’s a slight element of restriction, but only a slight one” given the Fed’s current rate setting, said Summers, a Harvard University professor and paid contributor to Bloomberg TV. Earlier this week, Fed Chair Jerome Powell reiterated his skepticism about the idea of using estimates of a neutral rate as a guide for policy. The question of what the neutral rate will be going forward “doesn’t really matter for policy today,” he said in answering questions at a Stanford University event. Last year, Powell said that it’s possible the short-term neutral rate might be higher than the long-term one, and also that the long-term one itself might be higher, but ultimately the calculation is “unknowable.” What’s the Fed’s ‘Neutral’ Rate? Why Does It Matter?: QuickTake Summers, by contrast, said it’s important to have a guide-post in setting current policy. “There’s no way to judge what policy is without knowing what would be a neutral policy,” he said. “Saying ‘we don’t need to know what the neutral rate is’ is like saying you should drive your car on feel, without looking at the speedometer,” Summers said. “It is just a mistake,” he said, while noting that he hadn’t seen Powell’s specific remarks this week. The former Treasury chief spoke after the March jobs report showed a 303,000 increase in payrolls that outstripped every economist’s forecast in Bloomberg’s survey, with the unemployment rate ticking down to 3.8% even as the size of the labor force expanded. Read more: US Jobs Roar Again as Payrolls Jump 303,000, Unemployment Drops “I don’t want to make a prescription for monetary policy in June, but on current facts and current trends, I think it would be an inappropriate act to cut rates” at that meeting, Summers said. Futures trading suggests traders are increasingly betting that September will be the most likely meeting for the Fed to start lowering rates. They also suggest doubts about whether policymakers will follow through on the three rate reductions for 2024 that were indicated in their projections, known as the dot-plot. “My best guess is that the right thing to do is going to be to stick where we are for considerably longer than the Fed dot-plot supposes,” Summers said. While it’s “certainly more likely than not that the next move will be down and should be down” in rates, there’s still “a real possibility that it should be up,” he said.

247,GOOG,Why top tech names are forming AI 'alliances': Analyst,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/why-top-tech-names-forming-144248994.html,"Thill points out that big names in tech still have a ways to go as the fruit of their labor may not be fully realized until 2025: ""There's chatter that Microsoft is putting up $100 billion new data center in...You can't do this if you're a start-up. This is why all these AI startups are starting to find partners, OpenAI with Microsoft, Enthropic with Amazon and Google here with Oracle. You're seeing alliances, and those alliances are coming together and building software. Again, it will be a bigger user for software for the internet and AI in 2025 and '24 and we'll start to see the ramp of these proof of concepts go in production, most likely in the back half of this year."" And they're in what we call POC or proof of concept. So companies are trialing them but they won't go live until later in '24. So the way to play high right now in our opinion is our clients are continuing to be long, the hardware and semi names, NVIDIA, AMD, Dell. And then as we get to the later in the year, there's going to be a switch over. We believe more to software because the software services will go live on top of that hardware. And so if you've seen the SMH, which is the semi index, has absolutely ripped year to date and the ECG which is a software index is massively underperformed as many of our clients say the ECG stands for I give up. Why don't I just own the semi index? So right now we look at companies like Microsoft, Amazon, Google in really good shape and there are three characteristics for AI to work. You have to have data. You have to have users. And you have to have a lot of money. I mean, there's chatter that Microsoft's putting a $100 billion new data center in who knows if that number is right even if it was wrong by 50%. You're talking about a $50 billion data center. These are not-- you can't do this if you're a startup. And this is why all these startups are starting to find partners, OpenAI with Microsoft, Anthropic with Amazon and Google Cohere with Oracle. You're seeing alignments and those alignments are coming together, they're building the software. And that again will be a bigger year for software and internet for AI. In 2025 and '24, we'll start to see the ramp of these proof of concepts go into production most likely in the back half of this year again. But they're going to be baby implementations. Little AI projects here and there. So we're not going to see mass market for a while because companies are still struggling with data governance. And is AI going to go wrong? And is the intern going to try to query the payroll data for the employee base. All the things that you worry about. And so you have to be very careful. So it's going to start private. It's going to start small. And it's going to build over time. And so the enterprise plays that we like would be Microsoft and Amazon. And the consumer plays we like would be meta and Google. "

During this period, the Zacks Internet - Services industry, which Alphabet falls in, has gained 10.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction? Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision. Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings. Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements. For the current quarter, Alphabet is expected to post earnings of $1.49 per share, indicating a change of +27.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days. For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.77 points to a change of +16.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged. For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.75 indicates a change of +14.5% from what Alphabet is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged. With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Alphabet. The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate: Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial. For Alphabet, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $65.95 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +13.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $290.4 billion and $322.55 billion estimates indicate +13.2% and +11.1% changes, respectively. Alphabet reported revenues of $72.32 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +14.6%. EPS of $1.64 for the same period compares with $1.05 a year ago. Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $70.77 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.19%. The EPS surprise was +2.5%. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period. Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects. Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is. As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued. Alphabet is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade. The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alphabet. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term. "
249,GOOG,Alphabet (GOOGL) Eyes HubSpot (HUBS): Potential Deal Brewing?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alphabet-googl-eyes-hubspot-hubs-121500364.html,
250,NVDA,"Tesla, Apple, Nvidia: Factors keeping these stocks popular",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/tesla-apple-nvidia-factors-keeping-153851961.html,"Charles Schwab Director of Trading and Education Joe Mazzola joins The Morning Brief to discuss why these companies remain popular amongst retail investors and takes a look at potential trends for the upcoming earnings season that may impact these stocks. Mazzola expands upon the report and why these stocks remain popular: ""I think with Nvidia, you can make case that AI remains strong amongst the investor base. They want to participate in that, and Nvidia is the leader of the pack. And I think with Apple and Tesla... retail investors tend to look for buying opportunities for names that they've owned in the past. And when you look at the performance of those two names, clear under performers in the Mag. 7 at this point, they're looking for chances to buy those stocks at a discount from where they were trading just three months ago."" [AUDIO LOGO] And let's bring in now Joe Mazzola, Charles Schwab director of trading and education to discuss more. Joe, not a big surprise here. We have what we call Yahoo Finance Trending Tickers, and it's based on the traffic to all our ticker pages. And guess what? Nvidia, Tesla, Apple almost always rounding out the top three here. And when you look at the performance of those two names, clear underperformers in the Mag Seven at this point, they're looking for chances to buy those stocks at a discount from where they were trading just three months ago. Now, to put that in context, it's still well below the levels that we saw in the meme stocks of 2021, but it might take a while before we see something like that again. So it's in a range where it's starting to show a lot of investor confidence. And I think a lot of that has to stem from the economy showing a firm stance and that it doesn't look like a recession is around the corner. I think you came out of a Q1 where earnings beat expectations fairly handily. Expectations, I think, were a little bit low from the analyst community. But the earnings beat was good. And investors are looking for a couple of factors. We talk about multifactor analysis. Two of the factors that we hear and that we talk about with our investor base quite a bit is positive earnings revisions. So you look at a company like Nvidia that they're the leaders of the pack there. But a couple of other things like free cash flow and then interest coverage ratio, meaning can they are they generating enough profits, revenues, and cash flow to pay off that debt, especially when you're seeing interest rates at these levels? Those are becoming extremely popular factors for our investors to look at. And those turned out to be prescient buys, kind of given what they did in the month of March. So it's really staples, health care, and IT for March were the biggest inflows. We did see some inflows in fixed income as well too. Now, I will say this. I think that relative to maybe Q4 earnings that came out in January and February, Q1 earnings, the bar's a little bit higher. We're not seeing the analyst community kind of lower the bar to the same extent that they did for the last quarter. So the bar is set a bit high. We'll get a better indication of that kicking off this Friday with a lot of the financial names. But I think it's kind of put up or shut up time right now for the market kind of given some of the valuations. And I think one of the big differences, like I said, between this time right now, we even seeing that 8% bump in the STAX relative to maybe 2021 is clients are more discerning when it comes to some of those SPAC names and they're a bit more discerning when it comes to the meme names. I think if you go back to 2022, yeah, look, they got burned a little bit on those names. And they're not they're not scooping them at the same levels that we maybe saw them in the past. "

252,NVDA,Why Micron Technology Stock Rallied on Monday Morning,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-micron-technology-stock-rallied-164437659.html,"The catalyst that sent the memory and storage chipmaker higher was a vote of confidence from a Wall Street analyst. After a quarterly supply chain review, the analyst came away more bullish on Micron's prospects. Users report that Micron's recently released HBM3E (High Bandwidth Memory 3E) chip offers ""meaningfully superior"" thermal and power performance vs. the competition. Vinh believes this puts Micron in the ""pole position"" and on track to exceed $1 billion in HBM revenue in calendar 2024. The positive impact of AI is beginning to have a dramatic effect on Micron's results. For its fiscal 2024 second quarter (which ended Feb. 29), the company generated revenue of $5.82 billion, up 58% year over year and 23% sequentially. That's just the tip of the iceberg: In its fiscal Q3, Micron is guiding for revenue to surge 76% year over year to $6.6 billion. Before you buy stock in Micron Technology, consider this: "

259,NVDA,These 3 Companies Are Leading the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Race,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-companies-leading-artificial-intelligence-140000336.html,"The artificial intelligence (AI) bull market is here. Following the launch of ChatGPT, the power of generative AI technology has become clear, and tech companies are racing to take advantage of it, both to find better ways to serve their customers and to make their operations more efficient. Let's take a look at a few of the companies leading the AI race. Nvidia prepared for this moment years ago, building out its capabilities in AI and partnering with companies like OpenAI, and it's paid off. The company has an estimated 98% market share of the data center GPU market, and its technological leadership and soaring demand for its components have led to a shortage and given it tremendous pricing power. Fourth-quarter revenue jumped 265% to $22.1 billion, driven by 409% growth in data center revenue to $18.4 billion. Its generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) net income jumped 769% to $12.3 billion, giving it a profit margin above 50%. Nvidia's growth rate will slow down, but the company has a solid lead in AI technology, which should mean it remains a winner. While Nvidia is the clear leader in AI hardware, Microsoft has established itself as the leader in AI software. Because of its partnership with OpenAI, in which it's invested an estimated $13 billion, and its diversification across multiple tech platforms, Microsoft has the ability to deploy AI capabilities across multiple product lines, and that's what it's doing. With the help of OpenAI, Microsoft has added AI technology to products like Azure cloud computing, GitHub code repository, Microsoft Office, and Bing search engine, and it's deployed its AI Copilot chatbot across those products and others. Those efforts are having an impact on the business already. For example, management said in its most recent quarter that six points of Azure's 30% revenue growth came from AI. Microsoft also has no intention of taking its foot off the gas. The company recently hired Mustafa Suleyman, the co-founder of DeepMind, who is considered one of the top minds in AI. It also hired several of its employees from Inflection AI after the AI start-up folded. Microsoft and CEO Satya Nadella have bet big on AI, and the company will continue to look for new ways to leverage the new technology. Like Microsoft, Alphabet has been investing in AI for years. The company acquired the AI lab DeepMind in 2014 and recently merged it with Google Brain. It's also been developing its own AI technologies for roughly a decade. Alphabet has been less aggressive than Microsoft in AI, but the Google parent quickly responded to the launch of ChatGPT with its own chatbot, Bard. That has evolved into Gemini, which may be the closest challenger to ChatGPT today. Alphabet's investments in its Waymo autonomous vehicle subsidiary shouldn't be overlooked either. While self-driving cars have largely been a disappointment thus far, Waymo appears to be the leader in the emerging technology, and its driverless vehicles are now on the road, ferrying passengers in cities like San Francisco, Phoenix, and Los Angeles. The company also uses AI to improve search results on both Google Search and YouTube and to offer increased functionality in Google Cloud. Much like its rival Microsoft, you can expect Alphabet to look for new ways to integrate AI in its products as it's bet big on the booming technology and plans to be a leader.

NVDA, Lam Research Corp. LRCX, Applied Materials, Inc. AMAT, Micron Technology, Inc. MU and ACM Research, Inc. ACMR. The semiconductor industry is having a bumpy ride. Sales have been steadily making a rebound but the challenges are far from over. However, the future holds promise given the high demand for chips. The Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) said on Apr 3 that global semiconductor sales totaled $46.2 billion in February, up 16.3% year over year. Sales in February 2023 totaled $39.7 billion. However, after a steady rise over the past few months, semiconductor sales fell 3.1% from January's total of $47.6. Regionally, year-over-year sales increased 28.8% in China, 22% in the Americas and 15.4% in Asia Pacific. However, sales declined 8.5% in Europe. John Neuffer, SIA president and CEO, said, ""Although month-to-month sales were down slightly, global semiconductor sales in February remained well ahead of the total from the same month last year, a continuation of the strong year-to-year growth the market has experienced since the middle of last year."" The semiconductor industry's growth stalled after reaching unprecedented heights during the peak of the pandemic. Rising costs, supply-chain disruptions, and higher interest rates resulting from the Federal Reserve's aggressive efforts to combat inflation acted as headwinds for the industry, particularly as demand slowed during the second half of 2022. As inflation began to ease, alleviating price pressures, demand rebounded. Also, the ongoing enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence (AI), especially generative AI, is expected to stimulate semiconductor sales in the near term. Experts believe that AI has tremendous potential and the world is yet to witness that. This has seen a large number of tech companies exploring the avenue in their bid to grab business opportunities. This is further likely to make semiconductors all the more important in the near term. According to a forecast by Gartner, global semiconductor revenues are projected to jump 16.8% this year totaling $624 billion. NVIDIA has an expected earnings growth rate of 14.1% for next year.

265,NVDA,3 Millionaire-Maker Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-millionaire-maker-artificial-intelligence-111500783.html,"According to Grand View Research, the AI market hit a valuation nearing $200 billion in 2023 and is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% through 2030. The trajectory will see the industry reach nearly $2 trillion by the end of the decade, suggesting that the market is nowhere near hitting its ceiling and it's not too late to invest in AI. So, here are three millionaire-maker artificial intelligence stocks to buy right now. In its most recent quarter (the fourth quarter of 2024, which ended in January), Nvidia's revenue increased by 265% year over year to $22 billion. This monster growth was primarily thanks to a 409% increase in data center revenue, reflecting a spike in AI GPU sales. Nvidia remains on a promising growth path, and earnings per share (EPS) estimates seem to support its potential. AMD was slightly late to the AI party as Nvidia beat it to the market. However, AMD is investing heavily in the industry and has formed some lucrative partnerships that could take it far in AI over the long term. AMD's earnings have yet to reflect its investment in AI. However, its recent quarterly earnings suggest it's moving in the right direction. In its fourth quarter of 2023, AMD's revenue rose 10% year over year to $6 billion, beating analysts' expectations by about $60 million. The company's AI-focused data center segment posted 38% revenue growth. The company has leading positions in multiple tech areas, including e-commerce, the cloud market, gaming, consumer products, and more. However, all eyes have been on Amazon's AI efforts over the last year. As the operator of the world's biggest cloud service, Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company has the potential to leverage its massive cloud data centers and steer the generative AI market. In 2023, AWS responded to increased demand for AI services by introducing a variety of new tools. Amazon is even using AI to boost its retail site and announced an AI shopping assistant dubbed Rufus ahead of its latest earnings release. Amazon is moving to become a major threat in AI over the long term, but it also has a lucrative retail business that makes its stock too good to pass up. Amazon's earnings are expected to reach nearly $7 per share over the next two fiscal years. In a similar calculation to Nvidia and AMD, multiplying that figure by the retail giant's forward P/E of 43 yields a stock price of $301, which could see its shares increase by 65% by fiscal 2026. As a result, Amazon is a millionaire-maker stock worth considering in 2024. Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this: "

267,NVDA,3 Supercharged Tech Stocks to Buy Without any Hesitation,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-supercharged-tech-stocks-buy-101500335.html,"Some already have shown their strength in recent times, advancing even after their top performances last year. So, just because a stock has gained in the double or even triple digits doesn't mean it's too late to buy that particular player. It's essential to take a look at the company's earnings track record, future prospects, and market position. Using these as a guide, investors can determine whether the stock has what it takes to generate more gains. These days, if a company has a strong presence in the high-growth area of artificial intelligence (AI), it scores extra points. (The AI market is expected to reach more than $1 trillion by the end of the decade.) Let's check out three supercharged tech stocks that easily pass this test, making them stocks to buy without any hesitation. Just recently, Nvidia announced much-anticipated news: It plans to release its new Blackwell architecture, which includes six technological innovations, later this year. Among these innovations are the world's most powerful chip and a second-generation transformer engine that will help Blackwell support double the computing power of its predecessors. The Blackwell platform also allows users to run generative AI at as much as 25 times lower cost and energy consumption compared to the previous platform. This has helped Meta grow revenue and profit, and the tech company reached a new level of strength recently, saying it's confident it can continue to grow and reward investors; so it launched its first dividend. Meta is going all in on AI. Eventually, users of its products and services can rely on AI tools there to enrich their experiences. With all of this in mind, Meta is dirt cheap for 25 times forward-earnings estimates. The e-commerce and cloud-computing giant struggled with higher inflation back in 2022 but quickly turned things around by revamping its cost structure -- a move that should help Amazon excel in any environment. Last year, Amazon's revenue climbed in the double digits, and it returned to profitability after a loss in 2022 -- the company's first net loss in almost a decade. Moving forward, Amazon should benefit from its dominance in the high-growth businesses of e-commerce and cloud computing, as well as its presence in AI. Amazon is using AI to improve its operations, leading to cost savings, and the company is selling AI products and services to clients through its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business. Both of these efforts should result in earnings growth in the near and long term. That's why Amazon doesn't look expensive today, trading at 42 times forward-earnings estimates. It's a stock I'd buy with no hesitation. Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this: "

269,NVDA,An Artificial Intelligence (AI) Game Changer Could Be Coming: Here Are 3 Top Stocks to Buy,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/artificial-intelligence-ai-game-changer-100700408.html,"The highest level of narrow AI is superhuman ability. Google's AlphaFold has already demonstrated superhuman skills in predicting 3D models of protein structures. Its AlphaGo has beaten the best human players at the complex game of Go. Development is underway for technology that goes beyond narrow AI. And it could be the biggest AI game changer of all. Some experts predict AGI could be coming soon. Google DeepMind co-founder and chief AGI scientist Shane Legg estimates a 50% chance AGI could be developed by 2028. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei expects AI that performs at human levels will be available within the next two to three years. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman thinks AGI will be built in the next four to five years. The most advanced large language models today such as Google Gemini and OpenAI's GPT-4 exhibit some attributes of AGI. These models probably fall into level one of general AI based on Google DeepMind's classification framework -- emerging AGI. AGI holds the potential to accelerate scientific progress dramatically on multiple fronts. It could radically change the global economy. It could also make some investors a boatload of money. With such a massive opportunity possibly on the way, several companies are scrambling to develop AGI. Unsurprisingly, Alphabet ranks among the leaders with its Google DeepMind unit. DeepMind has pioneered several major advances in AI, including the transformers that made models such as ChatGPT possible. (The ""T"" in GPT stands for transformer.) Google has also invested $2 billion in Anthropic, another AGI developer to watch closely. Alphabet could profit from AGI in several ways. It could use the technology to power virtual assistants that revolutionize (and possibly replace) search engines. AGI could be integrated throughout Google Home devices. Google Cloud could host AGI apps for customers. The company's Waymo unit could use AGI to improve its autonomous vehicles. That doesn't mean Microsoft won't be able to benefit from OpenAI's AGI advances, though. I suspect that it will. If so, the company would likely be able to monetize AGI in several of the same ways as Alphabet, including hosting AGI apps on its Azure cloud platform. AGI could also help Nvidia make better chips. CEO Jensen Huang said earlier this year that the company's chips ""can't be designed without AI"" today. Huang, by the way, predicts that AGI could arrive within five years. Now for a reality check. It's possible that the predictions of AGI being ready in the near future could be overly optimistic. Some experts think it could be decades before we have AGI. Even Google DeepMind's Legg, who expects AGI might arrive in a few years, believes it will take decades for AGI applications to be developed across the full spectrum. In the meantime, practical issues such as premium valuations could cause one or more of these AGI stocks to underperform. Over the long run, though, if AGI achieves its potential, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Nvidia could be even bigger winners than they've been in the past. Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this: "
270,NVDA,UPDATE 1-TSMC wins $6.6 bln US subsidy for Arizona chip production,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-tsmc-wins-6-6-093513309.html,"(Adds further comments from TSMC, paragraph 12) By David Shepardson and Stephanie Kelly WASHINGTON, April 8 (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department said on Monday it would award Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co's (TSMC) U.S. unit a $6.6 billion subsidy for advanced semiconductor production in Phoenix, Arizona and up to $5 billion in low-cost government loans. TSMC agreed to expand its planned investment by $25 billion to $65 billion and to add a third Arizona fab by 2030, Commerce said in announcing the preliminary award. The Taiwanese company will produce the world's most advanced 2 nanometer technology at its second Arizona fab expected to begin production in 2028, the department said. ""These are the chips that underpin all artificial intelligence, and they are the chips that are necessary components for the technologies that we need to underpin our economy, but frankly, a 21st century military and national security apparatus,"" Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said in a statement. TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker and a major supplier to Apple and Nvidia, had previously announced plans to invest $40 billion in Arizona. TSMC expects to begin high-volume production in its first U.S. fab there by the first half of 2025, Commerce said. The $65 billion-plus investment by TSMC is the largest foreign direct investment in a completely new project in U.S. history, the department said. Congress in 2022 approved the Chips and Science Act to boost domestic semiconductor output with $52.7 billion in research and manufacturing subsidies. Lawmakers also approved $75 billion in government loan authority. TSMC Arizona has also committed to support the development of advanced packaging capabilities through partners in the U.S. to allow customers to purchase advanced chips that are made entirely on U.S. soil, the department said, adding 70% of TSMC customers were U.S. companies. TSMC CEO C.C. Wei said the company would help U.S. tech firms ""unleash their innovations by increasing capacity for leading-edge technology through TSMC Arizona."" Commerce expects the projects will create 6,000 direct manufacturing jobs and 20,000 construction jobs. The department said 14 direct TSMC suppliers plan to construct or expand U.S. plants. At full capacity, TSMC's three fabs in Arizona will manufacture tens of millions of leading-edge chips in 5G/6G smartphones, autonomous vehicles, and AI data center servers, the department said. Through its Arizona fabs, TSMC will support key customers like Apple, Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices and Qualcomm ""by addressing their leading-edge capacity demand, mitigating supply chain concerns, and enabling them to compete effectively in the ongoing digital transformation era,"" the department added. TSMC said in a separate statement that its Arizona factories aim to achieve a 90% water recycling rate, adding that the company has started the design phase of building a water reclamation plant with a goal of achieving ""near zero liquid discharge"". Commerce last month announced $8.5 billion in grants and up to $11 billion in loans for Intel to subsidize leading-edge chip production from the same program. The department is expected to unveil an award for South Korea's Samsung Electronics as soon as next week, sources said. Commerce declined to comment. Samsung did not respond immediately to a request for comment.

273,NVDA,Forget Nvidia: 3 Prominent Billionaire Investors Are Selling It and Buying These 6 Value Stocks Instead,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/forget-nvidia-3-prominent-billionaire-090600307.html,"When describing ""AI,"" I'm talking about the use of software and systems for tasks that would normally be overseen by humans. Machine learning allows these systems to evolve over time without human intervention in order to become more effective at their tasks, or perhaps even learn new tasks. AI has utility across most sectors and industries, which is probably what led the analysts at PwC to estimate that this innovation would add $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. Big dollar figures like this won't go unnoticed. To be fair, no company has been a greater beneficiary of the rise of artificial intelligence than Nvidia. The company's A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) are expected to account for around 90% of the GPUs deployed in AI-accelerated data centers this year. In particular, Nvidia's H100 is vital to training large language models and fueling generative AI solutions. In fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 28, 2024), Nvidia's data center sales rose 217%! But if investors dig beneath Nvidia's superficial sales growth, they'll find some potential red flags. For example, the lion's share of the company's sales growth last year can be attributed to exceptional pricing power on its GPUs. A limited supply of A100 and H100 chips allowed the company to dramatically raise its sales price on these units. As new competitors enter the space and Nvidia increases its own production, the scarcity of GPUs will taper off. When that happens, Nvidia's pricing power and gross margin won't be nearly as impressive. Lastly, there hasn't been a next-big-thing trend over the last 30 years that didn't undergo an early-stage bubble. This is to say that investors have a consistent habit of overestimating the adoption and/or utility of a next-big-thing trend or innovation. AI is unlikely to be the exception that breaks this unwritten rule. All told, three prominent billionaire investors pared down their funds' sizable stakes in Nvidia during the fourth quarter, including: Israel Englander of Millennium Management: 1,689,322 shares sold. Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International: 1,170,611 shares sold. Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management: 218,839 shares sold. Here's what's truly interesting: While these billionaires were busy selling shares of potential AI bubble stock Nvidia, they and their respective investment teams were piling into an assortment of value stocks. The December-ended quarter witnessed Englander and his team pare down Millennium's stake in Nvidia by 45%. Rather than shifting this money to other high-growth companies, there was a very clear emphasis placed on purchasing shares of former industry leaders that appear poised for a comeback. Two value stocks this top-tier billionaire piled into include: Despite these concerns, AT&T has been steadily moving the needle in the right direction thanks to the 5G revolution. Upgrading its wireless network has encouraged consumers to increase their data consumption -- and data happens to be the biggest margin driver of AT&T's wireless division. Further, AT&T has gained at least 1 million net broadband subscribers for six consecutive years. Brand-name and generic-drug company Teva Pharmaceuticals has been buried under debt following the (in hindsight) overpriced acquisition of Actavis in 2016. It's also dealt with a long list of litigation concerning its role in the opioid crisis. The good news for Teva is that it settled its opioid litigation with almost every U.S. state last year. With this gray cloud now lifted, the company has turned its attention to selling non-core assets, further reducing its net debt, and refocusing some of its capital on higher-margin novel drug research. AT&T and Teva are currently valued at respective forward-year earnings multiples of just 7.7 and 5.4. Highly successful billionaire asset manager Jeff Yass also chose to invest in value stocks while dumping a portion of Susquehanna's stake in AI stock Nvidia. The two exceptionally cheap stocks he and his team purchased include: Pfizer stock recently hit a 10-year low after warning that COVID-19 sales from its vaccine (Comirnaty) and oral treatment (Paxlovid) would retreat to $8 billion on a combined basis after reaching more than $56 billion in 2022. To boot, the company expects to record a $0.40-per-share charge in 2024 related to its acquisition of cancer drug developer Seagen. Although Pfizer is navigating its way through some challenges, it's important to recognize that they're all short-term in nature. Pfizer's non-COVID drug sales continue to climb, and it's still generating $8 billion in sales from COVID-19 therapeutics that didn't exist a few years ago. Plus, the addition of Seagen expands Pfizer's cancer-drug pipeline and should provide ample cost savings. Meanwhile, Alibaba's share price has been held down by China's economy. Though the world's No. 2 economy was expected to quickly bounce back after abandoning strict COVID-19 mitigation measures, supply chain kinks have remained, and growth has been subdued. Thankfully, Alibaba is China's undisputed leader in both e-commerce and cloud infrastructure services. Taobao and Tmall accounted for almost 51% of China's online retail sales in 2023, per the International Trade Administration. Comparatively, tech-analysis company Canalys pegged Alibaba Cloud as controlling a 34% share of cloud infrastructure services spend in the first quarter of 2023 in China. These segments, coupled with Alibaba's $92 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and various investments, put a healthy floor beneath its shares. Pfizer and Alibaba ended the trading session on April 3 at respective forward-year earnings multiples of 9.9 and 8.3. The third prominent billionaire investor who sent Nvidia to the chopping block and purchased value stocks was Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management. Two extremely cheap industry stalwarts Laffont and his team purchased during the fourth quarter are: The skepticism surrounding legacy automakers like General Motors (""GM"") is that they would be left in the dust by cutting-edge electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers. However, with global EV demand hitting what appears to be a temporary peak, GM's highly profitable internal combustion engine (ICE) lineup is back in focus. Though EVs should grow into a larger percentage of new vehicle sales in the years to come, GM's highly profitable ICE segment affords the company the ability to spend aggressively or slow production with its EV segment to avoid steep losses or margin degradation. General Motors is also profitable in China, the world's leading auto market. The largest electric utility by market cap, NextEra Energy, found its stock under pressure in 2023 as short-term Treasury yields soared. Income investors tend to purchase utilities for their low volatility and market-topping yields. But if they can get similar yields with a T-bill, it's utility stocks like NextEra that suffer. However, this looks to be a temporary swoon for the clear leader in renewable energy capacity. No utility in the world generates more capacity from wind (24 gigawatts (GW)) and solar (7 GW) than NextEra. While these clean-energy projects have, at times, been pricey, they've demonstrably helped to lower electricity-generation costs and led NextEra to annualized adjusted earnings-per-share growth of 10% since 2013. Shares of GM and NextEra Energy can be purchased for 4.9 and 17 times their respective forward-year earnings. Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this: "

277,NVDA,Wall Street Searches for AI Winners Across Emerging Markets,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-is-searching-for-ai-winners-across-emerging-markets-120000269.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Some of the world’s biggest money managers are searching for the next wave of artificial intelligence winners beyond the US. Most Read from Bloomberg At a time when the global euphoria about AI has propelled a three-fold surge in Nvidia Corp. and a 50% jump in a key US index for semiconductor manufacturers in less than a year, investors are pointing toward emerging markets for better value and a bigger pool of options. The asset management arm of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said it’s looking specifically for stakes in the manufacturers of AI supply-chain components, such as cooling systems and power supplies. JPMorgan Asset Management favors traditional manufacturers of electronics that are morphing into AI leaders, while investment managers at Morgan Stanley are betting on players where AI is reshaping business models in non-tech sectors. “We see AI as a growth driver in emerging markets,” said Jitania Kandhari, deputy chief investment officer at Morgan Stanley Investment Management. “While we have previously invested in direct AI beneficiaries like semiconductors, going forward it will be key to look for companies in different industries that are adopting AI to enhance earnings.” AI stocks are already leading a $1.9 trillion rebound in emerging markets this year, with Taiwanese and South Korean chip companies such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and SK Hynix Inc. accounting for 90% of the gains, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Despite this rally, most emerging-market AI stocks still offer far better value than their US peers. While Nvidia trades at 35 times its projected earnings, Asian AI giants are typically valued between 12 and 19 times. Developing markets also offer faster growth. Analysts see a 61% increase in earnings for emerging-market technology companies as a whole, compared to the 20% rise that they were penciling in for US peers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. So far, the stars of the show are those companies which already were technology leaders prior to the AI rally, such as TSMC and Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. The duo and MediaTek Inc., also a chipmaker, feature in a JPMorgan single-country fund that invests in Taiwanese equities and has outperformed 96% of more than 1,400 peers. The three stocks are also among the top-10 holdings of the iShare MSCI EM Ex-China ETF, which has doubled in value over the past five months. “The tech companies that have historically been the suppliers to the big names, may well emerge as the big players themselves,” said Anuj Arora, head of emerging markets and Asia Pacific equities at JPMorgan Asset Management. “The early adaption of this technology means these companies are far ahead of their competitors in leveraging newer evolutions.” Still, the buzz is widening and more investors are pouring in money. For example, Korea’s Hanmi Semiconductor Co., majority-owned by billionaire Kwak Dong Shin’s family, has surged about 120% this year for the best gains among members of the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. It as also seen its share of foreign ownership increase in recent weeks, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In Vietnam, IT services provider FPT Corp. has jumped almost 20% this year, lifting the Ashmore EM Frontier Equity Fund as the best performer among actively managed emerging market funds in the US. For EM-focused exchange-traded funds in the US, more than half of all inflows this year have gone into the iShares MSCI EM ex-China ETF, whose top 10 holdings include companies that are investing in AI, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A Taiwan-based fund, Yuanta Taiwan Value High Dividend ETF, got $5 billion of fresh deposits in the week through April 3, reversing EM-wide outflows for the period into inflows, according to EPFR. Elsewhere, established businesses have attracted fresh investor interest after signaling that they’re moving into AI. Saudi Arabia is becoming a hotbed for Chinese AI ventures, such Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s cloud partnership with Saudi Telecom Co. India’s Reliance Industries Ltd., the petroleum giant run by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, has developed a chatGPT-style model with capabilities in 22 Indian languages. The company is also part of the digital transformation in the country of 1.4 billion people. “We would point to the potential ‘national champions’ mindset that is developing around AI in some markets,” said Luke Barrs, global head of fundamental equity client portfolio management at Goldman Sachs. “Countries are focused on fostering homegrown companies that can be future leaders.” The trade is not without its risks. Emerging markets are tied closely to the US, meaning that an AI selloff could echo across the world. Alternatively, if stock-market gains broaden out, then other sectors may catch up and AI names could lag behind. Still, investors are increasingly finding EM alternatives to US tech stocks that have over-extended themselves, said Morgan Stanley’s Kandhari. “In emerging markets, they are seeing AI as an under-appreciated driver going forward,” she said. “There’s a lot of low-hanging fruit to juice there.” What to Watch In Brazil, March inflation data will offer clues on whether the central bank can dial down its hawkish message, according to Bloomberg Economics. In Argentina, inflation has probably decelerated for a third month in March. Mexico’s headline inflation will likely rise in March, with non-core food and energy prices accounting for most of the advance. Central banks in Philippines, Thailand and South Korea are scheduled to announce rate decisions. (Adds Yuanta ETF inflows in 14th paragraph) Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek ©2024 Bloomberg L.P.

278,NVDA,Here's the $4.7 Trillion Market Nvidia Has Its Eyes on Now,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-4-7-trillion-market-183000882.html,"The U.S. spent an estimated $4.7 trillion on healthcare last year. That amounts to roughly 18% of the country's total economic output. Nvidia has recently made several major moves in this big market. To be sure, healthcare isn't a brand-new focus for Nvidia. The company's technology has been used in healthcare before. For example, Nvidia launched its Clara AI platform for medical imaging in 2018. However, the company appears to have shifted its healthcare efforts into a higher gear. It's not an exaggeration to say that AI holds the potential to transform healthcare. How? Let's start with diagnosing diseases. AI has already shown tremendous promise in analyzing medical images, as GE Healthcare is doing with Nvidia's TensorRT software. The technology can help rapidly analyze test results, create personalized medical risk assessments for patients, and provide decision support for physicians. AI can make medical technology devices more effective. That's what J&J hopes to do by using Nvidia's IGX edge computing platform and Holoscan edge AI platform to help develop new surgical devices. One of the biggest complaints that U.S. healthcare professionals have is the amount of administrative work they must do. AI holds the potential to streamline a wide range of administrative tasks, including appointment scheduling, claims processing, and clinical documentation. This hasn't been a major area of focus for Nvidia so far, but it could present a big opportunity for the company. Nvidia's ongoing expansion into the lucrative healthcare market could achieve tremendous success. However, I don't think these healthcare efforts by themselves justify buying the stock right now. But what about the combination of Nvidia's healthcare initiatives and everything else the company is doing? Its overall growth prospects remain highly attractive. My chief concern with Nvidia is that its stock has such lofty expectations baked in that any hint of less-than-spectacular results could cause shares to fall hard. Still, I think any pullback would present a great buying opportunity for this high-flying stock. And that's my view regardless of whether Nvidia conquers the healthcare market. Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this: "
279,NVDA,Nvidia Stock Is Like Cisco Stock Before the Dot-Com Crash? There Are Big Holes in This Theory,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-stock-cisco-stock-dot-160000455.html,"Nvidia is the dominant maker of GPUs for accelerating the processing of AI and high-performance computing (HPC) workloads in data centers. It has an estimated 90% share of the data center AI GPU chip market, and 80% share of the overall data center AI chip market. It also targets other markets, but its data center business is its largest, accounting for 83% of its revenue last quarter. Cisco's CEO in the below chart refers to John Chambers, who led the company from 1995 to 2015. Cisco was founded in 1984 by two Stanford University computer scientists and went public in 1990. Nvidia has had only one CEO since its founding in 1993, co-founder Jensen Huang. The company went public in 1999. Qualitative Metric Cisco Systems Late 1990s Nvidia Now Run by a founder-CEO? No Yes CEO educational background* Business (including an MBA) and legal Electrical engineering (including a master's degree) CEO work background* - VP of Operations at Wang Laboratories (a now-defunct computer company) Company's primary growth driver Internet adoption and growth AI adoption and growth, particularly generative AI.*** (A notable secondary driver is the growth of computer gaming.) Main products Internet networking products (hardware and software) and services. Main hardware products in the 1990s included switches (LAN and WAN)**, access servers, and routers. Primarily GPU chips and related hardware, software, and services. It also offers other chips, such as central processing units (CPUs) and a ""superchip,"" which is basically a combined CPU-GPU. Competitive moat Moderate-to-high overall High overall -- Its GPUs and associated hardware and software have a high degree of complexity. Growth strategy Considerable focus on acquisitions Heavily organic growth. Acquisitions have mainly been small, except for 2020's $7 billion acquisition of Mellanox, which makes high-performance networking products. *According to public records. **LAN = local area network; WAN = wide area network. *** Generative AI is the tech behind OpenAI's extremely popular ChatGPT chatbot, released in late 2022. Studies support the theory that stocks of public companies run by founder-CEOs tend to perform better over the long term than those run by non-founders. Huang is a co-founder of Nvidia; Chambers was not involved in founding Cisco. Huang's educational and work background before starting Nvidia was in electrical engineering and semiconductor design, respectively. These factors give him a major advantage over CEOs of technology companies whose backgrounds are not as technical, in my view. The moat differences will be more evident in my second article on this topic focusing on quantitative factors. Suffice it to say here that Cisco's profit margins were steadily declining for a few years before its stock plunged. One main reason was competitive pressures on pricing. Nvidia's profit margins are currently at record highs. Let's move to the last category in the chart -- growth strategy. Cisco in the 1990s was a corporate equivalent of the iconic video game Pac-Man -- it devoured a lot of companies. From 1993 through July 2000, the company ""acquired or announced our intent to acquire 65 companies,"" it said in its fiscal year 2000 annual report. Nvidia, on the other hand, is mostly growing organically. Granted, it relatively recently made one huge acquisition, Mellanox, but it had already been growing at a robust pace before this deal. In other words, Nvidia didn't need to ""buy growth."" And prior to this acquisition, Mellanox was a Nvidia partner, not a competitor, so it didn't buy the company in order to get rid of a competitor. Growth strategies that heavily focus on acquisitions are very challenging to pull off successfully. They take the time and attention of top execs away from focusing on internal innovation. They eat up money that could be spent on research and development. In addition, it's difficult to meld different corporate cultures. Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this: "
280,NVDA,1 Chip Manufacturing Stock Making a Big Bet on AI,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-chip-manufacturing-stock-making-153100828.html,"Renesas is an integrated device manufacturer, a company that both designs and manufactures semiconductors. It's a hybrid business model that has been making a comeback in recent years. Besides Japan emerging as a top destination for manufacturing in the East, Renesas can thank the electric vehicle (EV) revolution for its resurgence, as well as a myriad of other more mature manufacturing processes (not leading-edge chips for things like data center AI) for chips in industrial and power applications. But the purchase of Altium, a small competitor to the EDA software giants Synopsys and Cadence, is something else entirely. Tiny Australia-based Altium (which, notably, counts Wolfspeed as a chip design customer) generated revenue of just $139 million in U.S. dollars in the first half of its current 2024 fiscal year. And yet Renesas will be shelling out A$9.1 billion ($6 billion in U.S. dollars, using exchange rates on April 5, 2024). That's a hefty price premium. Renesas' stated rationale is to boost the software and digital tool capabilities it offers its clients, as many of those customers (automakers, for example) are non-techies who may need help implementing next-gen electronics. That's likely where Renesas sees massive opportunity by purchasing Altium, and competing with Synopsys and Cadence in electronics system design. Semiconductor manufacturing companies have a pathway to sustained growth thanks to customer interest in embedding intelligent computing systems across a broad ecosystem of devices, from cars to automated factory equipment to smart home devices. All that new AI embedded in devices themselves, rather than housed in data centers, is going to need far more sophisticated hardware. It's also going to need more energy-efficient hardware, like the type Renesas has been working on (again, with the Wolfspeed deal). Renesas could secure itself a seat at the table for years to come by combining not just the chips, but also the software, to make those AI devices a reality. Renesas could be a hidden growth stock in the AI race.

282,NVDA,Memo to Disney CEO Bob Iger: Now you must deliver for retail investors,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/memo-to-disney-ceo-bob-iger-now-you-must-deliver-for-retail-investors-123042555.html,"Maybe I'm going to tell you something here you already know, but it warrants repeating. I do not think the majority of public company corporate boards, C-suites, investor relations departments, and other related teams generally give a horse's butt about the retail investor. Aka the average investor aka Main Street aka a person grinding away each day in the hopes of living comfortably in retirement. How can I make such a bold proclamation? For one, I talk to people in all these groups every single day of my waking life, and have for 21 years. Everyone is so fixated on their compensation plans, perks of the gig, what institutional investors may do, what a competitor is saying on TV, and if an influential sell-side analyst is about to slash estimates and drop a rating. Other worries include business plans, their execution of them, and nailing the highly publicized succession to an underboss. I never hear them discuss how their actions may affect the average investor. And I mean never. Secondarily, just look at how companies speak to the outside world when they are forced to do so. It continues to be some form of morse code that requires a Harvard honors degree to decode. Throughout the entire ordeal, we heard Disney CEO Bob Iger fire back at billionaire Peltz. We heard Peltz fire back at the very fit 73-year-old Iger. We saw both parties beg and plead to get the support of institutional investors such as BlackRock and T. Rowe Price. Neither person spoke directly to retail investors, probably because they thought it was beneath their existence on Earth. Neither one went Elon Musk style and held a webcast to take questions from the average shareholder. Iger could have done this; they're a media company and surely have the assets to execute (drop me a line, Bob, we can host these webcasts on Yahoo Finance). At the end of the day, it was the retail investor that played a large role in the final outcome. Retail investors represent just under 40% of Disney's shareholder base. Some 75% of retail investors who cast votes backed Disney's slate, the Wall Street Journal reported. If Peltz had spoken directly to this group, maybe he would have a board seat at Disney. If Iger had appealed directly to this group, maybe his win would've been even larger — giving him yet another moment to boast about at a movie premiere before he retires maybe in 2026. So now my message to Iger is this: The average investor who owns your stock because they enjoy Mickey, your movies, and the dividend check has supported you and what you want to do. Show them respect because they are a powerful group. Deliver for them. Meanwhile, the World Economic Forum estimates that retail investors will account for 61% of global assets under management by 2030. That number stood at 52% in 2021. Retail investors are a force to be reckoned with, Interactive Brokers chief strategist Steve Sosnick told me. ""They certainly follow the action and are attracted to the big names and oddball situations that crop up,"" said Sosnick. He is right. And Bob, you can't get complacent either or this group will turn — and likely influence larger investors more than this latest go around. Execute, or else. Disney declined to make Bob Iger available to Yahoo Finance for an interview. "
283,NVDA,"Meet the Best-Performing ""Magnificent Seven"" Stock Over the Last Month (Hint: It's Not Nvidia)",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meet-best-performing-magnificent-seven-114500442.html,"However, something has changed over the last month. One of the three Magnificent Seven stocks that had been down year to date is suddenly up -- a lot -- over the last month. It has been a wild ride for Alphabet stock in 2024. In late January, it was around the same price it is today -- above $150 a share. But in early March, it fell to the low $130 per-share range due to investor pessimism regarding its artificial intelligence (AI) investments -- specifically, Google Gemini AI and its inaccuracies. Partnering with Apple would be a huge deal for Alphabet. Despite owning various differentiated businesses, like Google Search, YouTube, Google Cloud, and Android, Alphabet still depends on ads for the vast majority of its revenue. The more it can diversify its business away from ads, the wider its moat and the more levers it can pull to unlock growth. At least in the short term, Alphabet stock has moved in and out of favor with Wall Street based on its perceived AI aptitude and potential. In reality, this is a company that has been monetizing AI for some time and has a massive research and development budget and cash to invest in innovation. With so many growth narratives flooding the market, it can be easy to get caught up in implied-growth trajectories and overlook the companies that have already accomplished so much and are earning a ton of profit. In other words, outweighing the unknown and discounting proven winners. Alphabet is a proven winner, but there are question marks surrounding how it will stay a winner in the midst of so much competition. Android is still the dominant operating system globally, but iOS is bigger in core areas like the U.S., and Apple has more control over its hardware and software integration than Alphabet. The glass-half-empty outlook on Alphabet is that it is a market leader across many different industries but that all of its industries are ripe for disruption. It has been the leader in search for decades, but can it maintain pole position in the face of mounting competition from short-video platforms or new competition remains to be seen? Consumers have more entertainment options than ever, so will YouTube lose market share to other streaming sites? Will Google Cloud be able to take market share against its larger peers? These are all valid questions. When you like a company, it's always good to consider the counterargument. Charlie Munger used to talk about the inversion process as a way to expand a line of thinking. Before buying a stock, we usually think about the reasons why the company is a good investment. But inversion would involve thinking about all the reasons why folks would want to sell the stock, why it could go lower, underperform the market, etc. There's usually a halfway decent counterargument to even the best stocks. But sometimes, even bad counterarguments can become dominant market sentiment if the market is pessimistic on a stock as it had been on Alphabet relative to the rest of the Magnificent Seven. Alphabet has an established, cash-cow business model and plenty of ways to monetize AI. It is no stranger to competition, as there are always other companies that want a slice of a high-margin industry. In Alphabet's favor is its inexpensive valuation. It has a mere 26.7 price-to-earnings ratio, slightly above Apple's 26.3 for the second-lowest of the Magnificent Seven stocks. It also has a 28.8 price-to-free-cash-flow (FCF) ratio, also second-lowest behind Apple in the Magnificent Seven. Alphabet may not be the most exciting growth stock out there right now. But what it does have is a profitable business and room to take risks and unlock growth. Alphabet's deep pockets and track record of innovation are reason enough for the stock to not trade at a discount to the S&P 500 (like it does today). Alphabet stock should have never fallen as much as it did. And even now, it looks like a reasonable long-term buy for patient investors. Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this: "
284,NVDA,Forget Nvidia: These Are Likely the Next Once-in-a-Generation Tech Stocks to Buy,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/forget-nvidia-likely-next-once-113000380.html,"In addition to non-lethal weapons, Axon sells body cameras and cloud-based software for evidence management and law enforcement operations. These products help protect law enforcement and citizens, ensuring accountability from all parties. Axon's revenue has grown virtually uninterrupted for years, benefiting from dependable government budgets: Today, Axon has over 17,000 customers, and the business boasts a 122% net revenue retention rate, meaning that solid growth is baked into the business even without it acquiring new customers. The stock has already been a big winner. Shares have returned a staggering 54,000% over their lifetime. Axon could continue to deliver. The business still does ""just"" $1.5 billion in annual revenue. Management estimates that its current addressable market is $63 billion, leaving a clear opportunity for growth over the coming decade and beyond. Fortunately, investors who missed out on these companies may have an opportunity in Sea Limited. Sea Limited started as gaming company Garena but since branched out into Shopee e-commerce and a fintech arm, SeaMoney. Sea operates in the often-forgotten Southeast Asian market. Its core markets in that region constitute an addressable market of more than 630 million people, nearly double the population of the U.S. Recovery in gaming could be game-changing for Sea Limited. In 2023, its revenue of $13 billion grew 5%. Nonetheless, Shopee's revenue rose 24% during that time, while SeaMoney experienced a 44% increase. Thus, reversing the 44% revenue decline in Garena would likely bring back massive growth on a companywide basis. Moreover, Sea earned $163 million in net income in 2023, its first yearly profit and a milestone that increases its appeal as an investment. Analysts expect Sea to build on that growth, forecasting an earnings increase of 116% this year and a 159% profit surge in 2025. Assuming those forecasts come to pass, such improvements could bring about a dramatic recovery in Sea Limited stock, bringing investors to the forefront of the massive and potentially lucrative Southeast Asian market.

285,NVDA,Is Nvidia Stock a Buy Now?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-stock-buy-now-110500784.html,"Let's examine whether Nvidia stock is worth buying right now. Nvidia stock's rapid rise in the past year has led some on Wall Street to express concerns that it may be in a bubble. However, investors shouldn't forget that the shares' outstanding gains have been backed by solid growth in revenue and earnings. It finished fiscal 2024 with $60.9 billion in revenue, a 126% increase over the previous year. Earnings rose at an even faster pace of 288% to $12.96 per share, driven by the low manufacturing costs and high prices of Nvidia's popular H100 graphics processing unit (GPU) that's used for training large language models. Nvidia is anticipating $24 billion in revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 at the midpoint. That would be a 233% increase over the prior year. For the full year, analysts are expecting Nvidia to deliver just over $111 billion in revenue, which would be an 82% jump over the previous year. However, Nvidia management's estimate that its total addressable market opportunity could hit $1 trillion in the long run suggests that its business still has a lot of room to run higher. Of that $1 trillion end-market opportunity, the company sees $100 billion coming from the gaming business and $300 billion from the data center segment. I'll focus this discussion on these two segments for the sake of brevity. Nvidia's gaming segment generated $10.4 billion in revenue in fiscal 2024, an increase of 15% year over year. There are a few impressive catalysts in gaming that explain why Nvidia sees a $100 billion market opportunity here. The first is the need for gaming hardware such as discrete GPUs. Market research firm TechNavio predicts that the gaming GPU market could clock an annual growth rate of more than 16% between 2022 and 2027, adding incremental revenue of just over $30 billion during this period. Nvidia controls 80% of the discrete GPU market, according to Jon Peddie Research, which puts the company in a solid position to corner a large chunk of this incremental revenue opportunity. Meanwhile, cloud gaming could open up another opportunity for Nvidia. As per third-party estimates, the cloud gaming market was worth just $5 billion in 2023. However, it is predicted to generate annual revenue of $143 billion in 2032. Nvidia's GeForce Now cloud gaming service ended 2023 with an estimated 9 million users, giving it a market share of 30%. If Nvidia continues to hold onto its share of this potentially lucrative market in the long run, it could see a massive jump in gaming revenue. All of this indicates that the company's addressable opportunity within gaming is indeed sizable and its dominant presence in this market should lead to substantial growth in revenue from last year's levels. Nvidia's data center business generated a record $47.5 billion in revenue in fiscal 2024, increasing an impressive 217% year over year. Just like the gaming segment, Nvidia enjoys a terrific market share in this niche as well, which means that it is on pole position to make the most of the $300 billion addressable opportunity it sees here. More importantly, Nvidia is significantly stepping up its game in data center GPUs with its upcoming Blackwell processors. The company claims that its next-generation data center processors are going to be at least 2.5 times more powerful than the current-generation Hopper offering in terms of computing power. Given that the upcoming chips are expected to be priced competitively when compared to the existing flagship H100 processor (in a range of $30,000 to $40,000), they are likely to help Nvidia maintain its strong position in this lucrative market.

But even though some of the Magnificent Seven stocks are trailing the market right now, others like Microsoft and Amazon continue to outperform. Here's why those two businesses are a buy this month, even though they are trading near their best-ever levels. Microsoft Azure is the world's second-largest provider of cloud services, and more than 53,000 business customers are paying to use large language models (LLMs) -- including OpenAI's GPT-4 -- to build their own AI applications on that platform. But Microsoft's consumer-facing products might be an even more lucrative opportunity over the long term. The company developed a virtual assistant called Copilot, which is similar to ChatGPT except it runs on a blend of OpenAI's GPT-4 and Microsoft's own in-house models. It has embedded Copilot into the Windows operating system, 365 document suite, Bing search engine, and Edge internet browser. Around 1.4 billion active devices worldwide are using Windows 10 and 11 alone (that includes commercial users). Even if only a fraction of them regularly engage with Copilot, it would be one of the most widely adopted AI assistants in the world. Considering it can answer complex questions and even generate images, Copilot has the potential to pull traffic away from traditional search engines like Google, creating an enormous financial opportunity for Microsoft through advertising. Over 1 billion people also use Microsoft 365 applications like Word, Excel, and PowerPoint (including 400 million corporate seats), and Microsoft now offers a Copilot add-on for $30 per user monthly. AI is the ultimate productivity tool, and it's the perfect companion for applications like Word because it can quickly draft content to save the user significant amounts of time. If just 100 million 365 users adopt Copilot, it could add $3 billion to Microsoft's revenue every single month. That would translate into a 17% increase on the company's $211 billion in fiscal 2023 revenue. The potential of Microsoft's large installed base of software products that could be used as vessels to monetize AI, whether via advertising or paid subscriptions, is a key reason Microsoft is now the world's biggest company, with a $3.1 trillion valuation. As long as investors can hold on for at least the next few years, there is no time like the present to buy Microsoft stock. Amazon is the world's largest e-commerce company, and it still generates more revenue from online sales than any of its other business segments, despite expanding into cloud computing, digital advertising, streaming, and more. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the largest cloud platform in the world by revenue, and it offers hundreds of digital solutions to help its business customers store data, operate their online sales channels, and develop software. But AWS is also home to many of Amazon's AI initiatives, and it wants to dominate three of the technology's core layers: hardware, LLMs, and applications. Amazon also develops LLMs under its Titan program. Developers can access them on AWS and use them as the foundation for their AI applications. It saves a substantial amount of resources, because building an LLM requires mountains of data, time, and money. Beyond Titan, AWS also offers large language models from leading AI start-ups like Anthropic, in which Amazon recently invested $4 billion. The final layer is the finished application. AWS offers products like CodeWhisperer, which helps developers accelerate their software programming. AWS also launched a virtual assistant called Q recently, which is perfect for businesses looking for a ready-made chatbot as opposed to building their own. Q can be tailored to meet specific needs and trained on the data of any organization to be as helpful as possible. Amazon generated $574 billion in total revenue last year, which is more than any of the other Magnificent Seven companies. However, despite its stock rising 20% in 2024 already and trading near an all-time high, it's still the cheapest of the Magnificent Seven as measured by the price-to-sales ratio. That spells opportunity for investors. "

289,NVDA,2 Tech Stocks to Buy Like There's No Tomorrow,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-tech-stocks-buy-theres-100000375.html,"The rebound in the semiconductor industry is great news for Intel because its chips are still found in over 60% of computers. Intel's revenue increased 10% year over year in the fourth quarter of 2023 and should continue to grow as the PC market recovers. Intel's client computing group reported a revenue boost of 33% year over year in Q4. The growth follows the launch of the Intel Core Ultra mobile processors, which are designed to power new AI experiences for PC users. Intel expects that AI-based PCs will make up 80% of the PC market by 2028. If that projection holds up, the company's recent success with its Core Ultra release suggests it still has the chops to hold its lead in the CPU market and rake in billions of new revenue. AI training requires more than just advanced processors. Companies are also ramping up investment in high-bandwidth memory and solid-state storage solutions to handle the massive data workloads. This puts Micron Technology in a great position for growth. Micron posted a 23% increase in sales last quarter, and that's just the beginning. The company experienced a slump last year, but revenue is starting to accelerate ahead of what management sees as a multiyear opportunity in serving the AI market. Micron's high-bandwidth memory product is already sold out for calendar 2024, and the majority of 2025 product has already been allocated. The company should also benefit from the adoption of AI-based PCs, since it's one of the leading suppliers of dynamic random access memory (DRAM) modules for computers. Management also expects AI-based phones to require more memory content per unit, which is a catalyst. The leadership team anticipates higher selling prices for memory this year, which should lead to record revenue in fiscal 2025. Over the next few years, Wall Street analysts see Micron's earnings per share reaching $10.05. Applying Micron's previous average P/E of 23, the stock could be worth $230 by 2026. That is nearly 80% above the current share price, which would be more than enough to outperform the S&P 500's average annual return. Before you buy stock in Intel, consider this: "
290,NVDA,"Forget Nvidia: Here Are 3 ""Magnificent Seven"" Stocks Wall Street Thinks Will Soar More",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/forget-nvidia-3-magnificent-seven-094500601.html,"It might be surprising that Wall Street is so optimistic about Apple. The tech giant's sales growth has slowed considerably, and its valuation is relatively high, with shares trading at a forward earnings multiple of nearly 26. Wall Street thinks Amazon can move even higher. The consensus price target for the stock is roughly 6.5% above the current share price. Forty-three of the 47 analysts surveyed by LSEG in April rate Amazon as a buy or a strong buy. Generative AI continues to provide a major tailwind for Amazon Web Services (AWS), as customers like to run apps where their data is. Since AWS commands the leading market share among cloud platforms, it's where many organizations are training and deploying their generative AI apps. Amazon's advertising business is also enjoying strong momentum. The company is using AI to boost the relevancy of the ads displayed to customers. It has also expanded advertising on Prime Video. The average analyst's 12-month price target is nearly 6% higher than the current price. Wall Street is overwhelmingly bullish about the tech stock, with 38 of the 43 analysts surveyed by LSEG in April rating Alphabet as a buy or a strong buy. Alphabet's Google unit has experienced a couple of embarrassments with its generative AI apps -- first, with Bard last year, and more recently, with Gemini earlier this year. However, these missteps don't seem to have concerned analysts very much. They're more focused on the growth opportunities for Google Cloud and Google's continued dominance in search. Some also have great long-term expectations for Alphabet's Waymo self-driving car business. You can't depend on Wall Street's price targets. Even highly paid analysts focused on scrutinizing companies' operations can't predict the future with a high level of accuracy. However, I suspect Wall Street could be right about Apple, Amazon, and Alphabet. They could be right about Nvidia, too. Nvidia could continue to soar higher, but competition is increasing. Any hiccup could cause the stock to tumble. I think Apple's shares could jump on good news at the upcoming developer conference. Amazon and Alphabet should deliver solid growth in the next few quarters, largely due to the generative AI tailwinds. Wall Street isn't always right. In this case, though, I agree with the analysts' takes on these Magnificent Seven stocks. Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this: "

292,NVDA,Ken Griffin Doesn't Think AI Will Be the Game Changer Other Investors Are Expecting,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ken-griffin-doesnt-think-ai-075000695.html,"In a recent interview with CNBC, Griffin poured cold water on the market's recent hype involving AI. ""It's not clear to me that we're going to get the productivity gains out of AI that the markets are broadly hoping for,"" he said. While he sees incremental benefits and the potential for AI to replace entry-level jobs (e.g. call center work), he's much more skeptical about AI replacing fund managers. And while large language models are good at ""regurgitating what is available to use on the world wide web,"" he doesn't believe their usefulness stretches much further beyond that. Investors are paying steep multiples for these stocks and essentially assuming a high level of growth in the years ahead. And if that growth doesn't pan out, the risk is that these stocks, at such high valuations, could be vulnerable to sell-offs. According to a recent survey from software company Retool late last year, even tech workers aren't convinced of AI's effectiveness. More than half of the 1,500 tech workers surveyed believe that AI is ""overrated"" and that there simply isn't enough evidence to suggest it will be as transformative as people expect it to be. While ChatGPT has become a great tool in drafting emails and creating essays, it and other chatbots have proven to be unreliable as well, ""hallucinating"" or making up facts at times. Although AI is showing a lot of promise, the risk is that investors may be expecting too much from these next-generation technologies too soon. If you're investing in Nvidia or any other highly priced tech stock today, you're likely doing so because of the expectations you have for its future growth prospects, particularly with respect to AI. And as promising as that outlook may be, it's also important to consider what happens if those expectations fall short, and whether you'd still want to be holding the stock if the growth related to AI starts to slow down. Recognizing the assumptions you're basing your investment on can help you identify the risks associated with your investment. In Nvidia's case, its business isn't entirely dependent on AI, and it can still make for a good tech stock to own for the long haul. But for other stocks, which you're investing in simply because they could do well due to AI and for which you would be paying a high premium, the safer option may indeed be to think twice about those investments.

293,NVDA,History Says Magnificent Companies Can Become Disappointing Stocks. Is Nvidia Next?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/history-says-magnificent-companies-become-215000246.html,"Given Nvidia's direct connection to the space -- and its surging earnings from it -- the stock has advanced rapidly. Over the past year alone the stock has gained 223%. Over the past three years, the gain is more than 550%. Over the past five years, its gain is more than 1,860%. Scan the 10-year price chart above and it looks like Nvidia's stock is lifting off like a rocket. The combination of that price rise and the general AI fever has investors clamoring to buy it. But don't jump on this rocket without considering some Wall Street history. It would be hard not to notice how similar its rocket-like trajectory is to the Nvidia graph above. But the key feature of this graph is actually not the stock price -- it's the dates. The graph ends with the last trading day of 1999. The next graph brings the story up to the present, and it should be more than enough to frighten any investor who is currently all-in on Nvidia. Simply put, after that giant peak during the dot-com boom there was a giant crash during the dot-com bust. And Cisco's share price still hasn't recovered all of the ground it lost. If you bought near the peak, you are still in the red on your investment (not factoring in dividends being reinvested). You can argue that this is a cherry-picked example, which is true. But there are no crystal balls on Wall Street, and there's no way to know for sure that Nvidia will avoid a similar fate. Indeed, while it has a dominant position now in the chips that support AI, competitors are working hard to catch up. When they do, Nvidia may not be quite so special anymore, and investors will probably sour on the shares. The history of Wall Street suggests that, at some point, Nvidia's shocking stock price rise will end, just like it has for so many other stocks before. Don't let FOMO get the better of you. Nvidia may be a magnificent company, but it could still end up being a terrible investment if you pay too much for it. Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this: "
294,NVDA,280 Billion Reasons to Buy Nvidia Stock Hand Over Fist Right Now,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/280-billion-reasons-buy-nvidia-201900880.html,"According to Mizuho, Nvidia's data center revenue in the current fiscal year could jump 87% to about $89 billion. More importantly, Rakesh predicts Nvidia's data center revenue could jump to $280 billion by 2027 (which will coincide with the bulk of the company's fiscal 2028). That suggests Nvidia's data center revenue could increase at an annual rate of 56% over the next four years, and there is a good chance it could indeed hit that mark. This impressive growth will be driven by the ramp-up of Nvidia's new chips. The company is set to launch the H200, B100, and B200 AI chips in 2024 and 2025. Customers are already lined up to get their hands on these processors. With the likes of Microsoft reportedly looking to spend a humongous $100 billion on building massive AI-focused data centers, it is easy to see why Nvidia is expecting robust demand for its upcoming offerings. Management explained on the latest earnings call that it expects ""next-generation products to be supply constrained as demand far exceeds supply."" As such, Nvidia could live up to Mizuho's prediction for $280 billion in data center revenue in 2027. It is worth noting Rakesh expects the overall AI data center market to generate $400 billion in revenue by that year, which means Nvidia would control 70% of the market, down from its current share of more than 90%. Nvidia generated $13.1 billion of revenue from its other segments (gaming, professional visualization, and automotive) last year. Assuming these other segments see zero growth and deliver the same amount of revenue in fiscal 2028, Nvidia's top line could still reach $293 billion in four years based on Mizuho's outlook. The stock is currently trading at 37 times sales, a premium to its five-year average sales multiple of 18, thanks to the stunning growth it has delivered in the past year. Assuming Nvidia trades at even 15 times sales in four years, its market cap would increase to $4.4 trillion based on the above revenue outlook, doubling from its current level.

Nvidia has grown dependent on demand from companies investing in AI and seeking capacity to drive AI projects. Nvidia's data center revenue made up more than 80% of total revenue in the most recent quarter. Well, one particular statistic offers us an answer. This is positive because growth in these mentions has almost steadily increased, yet the current level of companies talking about AI leaves plenty of room for growth. And if more companies are talking about AI, that indicates more companies may be launching AI projects, and for this, many of them may turn to chip leader Nvidia.

297,NVDA,"After Soaring 178%, Reality May Be Setting in for SoundHound AI",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/soaring-178-reality-may-setting-152800860.html,"Have you ever witnessed a magician do a trick only to ask, ""how did they do that?"" Magic is interesting because even though you know what you're witnessing is merely an illusion, oftentimes you find yourself actually believing it. Over the last year, the world has been captivated by the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). With chatbots, self-driving cars, and humanoid robots, AI almost seems magical -- except this time it's real. Investors have been eager to buy into just about anything powered by AI, but not all opportunities are created equal. One research firm is not impressed with SoundHound AI, and I think it has raised some legitimate concerns. Let's dig into a freshly published short report by Capybara Research, and assess why an investment in SoundHound AI carries outsize risk compared to other opportunities in the artificial intelligence (AI) realm. AI-powered speech recognition is an interesting component of the overall AI narrative. Whether you realize it or not, you actually interact with this technology fairly often. When I reviewed SoundHound's fourth-quarter and full-year 2023 earnings report a few weeks ago, I noticed something. Management used to include a key performance metric called ""cumulative bookings backlog"" -- a figure that was meant to provide investors with a glimpse of future revenue commitments. However, in the fourth-quarter report this metric was updated to be called ""cumulative subscription and bookings backlog."" While this subtle change in verbiage may seem harmless, management's commentary is what raised my eyebrows. CFO Nitesh Sharan said that this metric represents bookings backlog plus ""new subscription revenue streams that we are focused on."" This is vague, at best. Sharan went on to say that ""subscription backlog takes into account customers where we are the leading or exclusive provider and assumes a four-year ramp to fully scale with a total five-year duration."" So management is forecasting future revenue that may not be fully committed yet. SoundHound AI has reported some encouraging financial results in recent quarters. In fact, the company reported record revenue in Q4. However, Capybara's research report included an interesting detail surrounding the company's financials. Specifically, the report leveraged footnotes from SoundHound AI's regulatory filings to uncover that the company is using one-time payments from terminated contracts to inflate revenue and margins in any given quarter. In other words, if a customer churns, SoundHound AI pulls termination fees forward. These are non-recurring sources of sales, but they appear as if revenue is experiencing upward momentum. This accounting maneuver combined with the vagueness of the new cumulative subscription and bookings backlog metric makes me wary. Capybara ended its report by putting a $1 price target on SoundHound AI stock -- it closed March 28 at $5.89. I cannot say with any real certainty if that is where SoundHound AI stock is headed, but what I can say is that the company will need more than new metrics and it will need to prove that it can organically grow revenue as opposed to using an accounting device to accelerate its top-line profile. If SoundHound AI fails to execute, liquidity will become an even bigger risk factor considering the company is still losing money and has only recently managed to reduce cash burn by laying off employees. For now, I'd steer clear of SoundHound AI stock. The company represents an interesting opportunity, but with shares soaring to levels disconnected from the fundamentals of the business, investors are better off pursuing proven, established players in the AI industry. Before you buy stock in SoundHound AI, consider this: "
298,NVDA,Should You Buy This Sneaky Artificial Intelligence Stock Before It's Too Late?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-sneaky-artificial-intelligence-stock-150000089.html,"The boom in artificial intelligence (AI) spending is unprecedented. Companies are investing billions of dollars to create data centers and other computing infrastructure in hopes of winning the AI technology wars. As hard as it may be to believe, the stodgy personal computer brand has indeed been a force in AI. The legacy technology provider has expanded its services beyond consumer devices, positioning itself to take advantage of this potential boom in data centers and cloud computing. That potentially makes Dell Technologies a sneaky AI winner, but should you buy the stock? Let's investigate. Dell is known for its branded Windows-powered computers. They still make up a sizable portion of the business. It focuses on high-end laptops and PCs, gaming stations, and business PCs. For fiscal 2024 (ended Feb. 2), Dell's computer segment, reported under its client solutions group, generated $48.9 billion in revenue and $3.5 billion in operating income. The segment saw a surge in growth during the pandemic, but it generated around the same amount of sales in fiscal 2024 as it did in 2020. It has produced consistent operating profits of at least $3 billion in each of the last five years too. What's more exciting is Dell's infrastructure solutions segment, at least from an AI perspective. The segment helps AI companies assemble and build highly efficient data centers around the world. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang even touted the company in his latest keynote, saying Dell was the premier solution for building data centers. Its financials are not rocketing higher like Nvidia's, but Dell's infrastructure solutions segment generated $4.3 billion in operating income last year. If companies keep going to Dell to help them optimize the computing power of advanced computer chips from the likes of Nvidia, investors should see this segment's earnings grow over the next few years. Dell's infrastructure solutions segment could grow rapidly over the next few years if companies keep building more and more AI computing systems. It is one of the top brands in the space, and there are tens of billions of dollars -- perhaps hundreds of billions -- in sales to go after. It is no surprise, then, to see some people getting excited about Dell as one of the next big AI winners. But betting on a stock just because of this hype-filled narrative is risky. Every year, there is a new story from Wall Street around what ""hot"" sector investors should buy. Sometimes, these are sectors that turn into sizable opportunities powering the global economy, like cloud computing. Most of the time, what was hot one year on Wall Street becomes a sideshow the next. In just the last decade, investors have seen booms and busts in sectors like cannabis, 3D printing, and the metaverse. These were all sectors talked about as the next big thing, but most of the stocks in these sectors severely underperformed the broad market. This is not to say AI is overhyped, but investors should tread lightly when investing in the popular trend of the day. But the company's underlying earnings have been volatile over the same period with fiscal 2024 earnings per share basically unchanged from 2021. That said, they are up significantly from pre-pandemic levels. Most of the stock's rise has thus come from multiple expansion. Its P/E ratio is now 27, which is right around the S&P 500 average. Buying the stock at a P/E of 27 implies an expectation the company sees strong earnings results in the next few years and fulfills the narrative that it is an AI beneficiary through consistent financial growth. So far, it's hard to see proof of this, while its competitors like Nvidia and Super Micro Computer are seeing their revenue and earnings rocket higher. If Dell Technologies can push earnings higher, the stock can still be a deal after its recent run-up. But if the bottom line remains stagnant or even declines, it is hard to see the stock sustaining its current momentum. Before you buy stock in Dell Technologies, consider this: "
299,NVDA,Jim Cramer is Bearish On These 10 Stocks in April,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jim-cramer-bearish-10-stocks-142022171.html,"Jim Cramer in his latest program on CNBC urged investors not to take the Federal Reserve’s policy statements and comments “seriously.” Cramer said it has now become a routine that whenever the Federal Reserve officials “blather”, people try to make sense of their every word to get clues about rate cuts and treat their comments as “gospel.” “I can’t take it anymore,” Cramer said. Cramer said that most of the time these comments signify “nothing” and they aren’t that “consequential.” Cramer was blunt about this matter and said that because many Fed officials can’t keep their “trap shut,” people keep trying to take hints from their comments about the possible number of rate cuts. Cramer said this leads to guessing games even though these comments don’t give us insights at all. He said many Fed members talk about two or three rate cuts and then wait and see how things “play out.” Cramer, however, said that Fed chair Jerome Powell’s comments matter. He said that as long as we have rate cuts “in front of us,” the number and timing of these rate cuts do not matter. “What matters is that the Fed wants to be our friend, that’s the takeaway,” Cramer added. Cramer said that nobody knows when rate cuts would begin. Investors, he said, should instead focus on finding buying opportunities in the market since he thinks the period before the beginning of rate cuts is “nirvana” for stocks. The CNBC host said the idea that stocks cannot go higher without rate cuts is just “patently false.” According to Jim Cramer, what matters here is whether there is any need to cut rates at all. He said the latest jobs report was strong which means the economy is “humming” and the consumer remains strong. He thinks the Fed does not need to do anything at the moment and we are entering the earnings season with a strong consumer. While Cramer is urging investors to buy companies like Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Eli Lilly And Co (NYSE:LLY) in the current environment for long term, there are some stocks he's bearish on. In this article we'll cover some of those. Cramer does not want investors to buy or hold mortgage residential REIT AGNC Investment Corp (NASDAQ:AGNC). In a recent program, Cramer said that this stock “just goes down” and “I don’t want you to touch that stock.” In its latest earnings call the company talked about important business updates and guidance: ""The fourth quarter marked a decided shift in Fed policy expectations and fixed income market sentiment. The shift in sentiment was led by favorable inflation data and was ultimately reinforced at the December Fed meeting with a reset of market expectations for a series of rate cuts in 2024. The path to the Fed’s December pivot was anything but a straight line. October was a continuation of extraordinary interest rate volatility, persistent higher for longer rhetoric from the Fed, and weak performance across most all fixed income asset classes as the 10-year treasury note yield broke through 5%. Market sentiment, however, improved materially in November following downside inflation data surprises and generally more balanced messaging from the Fed regarding the outlook for monetary policy and inflation. In response to this improving outlook and with equity markets near all-time highs, fixed income investor sentiment turned in favor of adding duration, which in turn caused interest rates to rally and spread products to outperform. Agency MBS across the coupon stack outperformed treasury and swap-based hedges with lower and middle coupons performing somewhat better than higher coupons. Hedge composition was also a significant driver of performance during the quarter as swap spreads tightened 10 basis points across the curve, 2s through 10s. As a result, an MBS position with treasury-based hedges performed meaningfully better than a swap-based hedge position. Our portfolio increased slightly from $59.3 billion to $60.2 billion as of December 31."" “You do not want to be in that stock,” Cramer said about Rocket Companies Inc (NYSE:RKT) when asked about the company by a caller who was wondering whether he should hold on to Rocket Companies Inc (NYSE:RKT) and wait for a rebound. Rocket Companies Inc (NYSE:RKT), which provides mortgage lending, title and settlement services, is down 9% so far this year. Cramer is bearish on RKT but recommends buying Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Eli Lilly And Co (NYSE:LLY). In February, during an earnings call, the company's management talked about how AI could shape Rocket Companies' business: ""With AI, we are rewriting the rules of the game and structurally and fundamentally changing how this industry operates. Our mortgage origination has long been associated with inefficient up and down hiring cycles. Because of that, scale profitability has been notoriously difficult to achieve in the mortgage industry because that volatility and cyclicality have made it challenging to adequately plan ahead and invest for the future. The industry has traditionally staffed up rapidly to handle higher volume in upmarkets, only to reduce staff and respond to down markets. So those who don’t manage capacity or liquidity effectively may be acquired or exit the industry altogether. And in 2023 alone, we saw this. We saw the industry with 62 M&A transactions, exits and bankruptcies, and recent data shows that capacity is down nearly 35% from the peak. We believe AI will shape the future of the home buying industry and Rocket leading the way. Technology is the answer to better client experiences and capacity management in our industry. We aim to redefine the home buying experience through AI and deliver market share growth, scaled revenue growth and profitability. I will share with you that automation and AI are being aggressively deployed across Rocket, helping us to deliver better client experiences at scale across the entire home-buying process. Now I’m going to share three examples of how AI is driving impact today across mortgage banking, underwriting and servicing. Purchasing a home can be an overwhelming process, which is why at Rocket, we excel in blending personalized service with cutting-edge technology."" Cloud services company Fastly Inc (NYSE:FSLY) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer is bearish on. When asked about Fastly Inc (NYSE:FSLY) recently on his program on CNBC, Cramer said that Fastly Inc (NYSE:FSLY) is not one of this favorites and he cannot back the stock. “I’m not going to endorse that stock.” Cramer might not be backing this stock, but 23 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database did have stakes in Fastly Inc (NYSE:FSLY) as of the end of 2023. The biggest stakeholder of Fastly Inc (NYSE:FSLY) is John Overdeck and David Siegel’s Two Sigma Advisors which owns a $23 million stake in Fastly Inc (NYSE:FSLY). While talking about the Dogs of the Dow on his recent program, Cramer said that his charitable trust owns Foot Locker Inc (NYSE:FL) but “that’s been a mistake.” In February, Cramer said that Foot Locker Inc (NYSE:FL) is down and not every stock in his portfolio is a winner. It’s important to note that back in March 2023, Cramer was highly bullish on Foot Locker Inc (NYSE:FL). He tweeted: “UBS says sell Footlocker, if you do this please remember to invite me to your funeral.” While Cramer is bearish on Foot Locker, he's urging investors to buy and hold Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Eli Lilly And Co (NYSE:LLY). Jim Cramer was recently asked about Under Armor Inc Class C (NYSE:UA) on his program on CNBC. While Cramer praised Under Armor Inc Class C's (NYSE:UA) founder Kevin Plank, he said that Under Armor Inc Class C (NYSE:UA) is in a “cutthroat business” with many companies, including Nike, struggling. “It’s a doggy dog world that Kevin finds himself in and it’s a tough situation for anybody.” As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 31 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Under Armor Inc Class C (NYSE:UA). Under Armor Inc Class C (NYSE:UA) shares are down about 24% over the past one year. Kevin Plank is returning as Under Armor Inc Class C (NYSE:UA) CEO, replacing Stephanie Linnartz.

300,AAPL,"Tesla, Apple, Nvidia: Factors keeping these stocks popular",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/tesla-apple-nvidia-factors-keeping-153851961.html,"Charles Schwab Director of Trading and Education Joe Mazzola joins The Morning Brief to discuss why these companies remain popular amongst retail investors and takes a look at potential trends for the upcoming earnings season that may impact these stocks. Mazzola expands upon the report and why these stocks remain popular: ""I think with Nvidia, you can make case that AI remains strong amongst the investor base. They want to participate in that, and Nvidia is the leader of the pack. And I think with Apple and Tesla... retail investors tend to look for buying opportunities for names that they've owned in the past. And when you look at the performance of those two names, clear under performers in the Mag. 7 at this point, they're looking for chances to buy those stocks at a discount from where they were trading just three months ago."" [AUDIO LOGO] And let's bring in now Joe Mazzola, Charles Schwab director of trading and education to discuss more. Joe, not a big surprise here. We have what we call Yahoo Finance Trending Tickers, and it's based on the traffic to all our ticker pages. And guess what? Nvidia, Tesla, Apple almost always rounding out the top three here. And when you look at the performance of those two names, clear underperformers in the Mag Seven at this point, they're looking for chances to buy those stocks at a discount from where they were trading just three months ago. Now, to put that in context, it's still well below the levels that we saw in the meme stocks of 2021, but it might take a while before we see something like that again. So it's in a range where it's starting to show a lot of investor confidence. And I think a lot of that has to stem from the economy showing a firm stance and that it doesn't look like a recession is around the corner. I think you came out of a Q1 where earnings beat expectations fairly handily. Expectations, I think, were a little bit low from the analyst community. But the earnings beat was good. And investors are looking for a couple of factors. We talk about multifactor analysis. Two of the factors that we hear and that we talk about with our investor base quite a bit is positive earnings revisions. So you look at a company like Nvidia that they're the leaders of the pack there. But a couple of other things like free cash flow and then interest coverage ratio, meaning can they are they generating enough profits, revenues, and cash flow to pay off that debt, especially when you're seeing interest rates at these levels? Those are becoming extremely popular factors for our investors to look at. And those turned out to be prescient buys, kind of given what they did in the month of March. So it's really staples, health care, and IT for March were the biggest inflows. We did see some inflows in fixed income as well too. Now, I will say this. I think that relative to maybe Q4 earnings that came out in January and February, Q1 earnings, the bar's a little bit higher. We're not seeing the analyst community kind of lower the bar to the same extent that they did for the last quarter. So the bar is set a bit high. We'll get a better indication of that kicking off this Friday with a lot of the financial names. But I think it's kind of put up or shut up time right now for the market kind of given some of the valuations. And I think one of the big differences, like I said, between this time right now, we even seeing that 8% bump in the STAX relative to maybe 2021 is clients are more discerning when it comes to some of those SPAC names and they're a bit more discerning when it comes to the meme names. I think if you go back to 2022, yeah, look, they got burned a little bit on those names. And they're not they're not scooping them at the same levels that we maybe saw them in the past. "

304,AAPL,Spotify Goes A Step Further On Its AI Journey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/spotify-goes-step-further-ai-160234714.html,"Perhaps not the greatest rivalry of all time, but the Apple Music and Spotify rivalry is undoubtedly among the music streaming industry’s greats. Spotify has been around for longer than Apple Music. Yet, Apple made an impressive digital music footprint and used its iPhone power to make things trickier for Spotify. By the looks of it, the EU regulators have put an end to those days. Strangely, Apple has been late in in infusing AI to enhance its offerings. While Apple has been keeping quiet on AI, it did add personalized recommendations last year, back when Spotify expanded its AI DJ. Generative AI has quickly grown to become much more than a simple buzzword, so Apple cannot afford to take a back seat but it’s nature has always been about being secretive- only time will show how it intends to infuse it across its offerings. Last February, Spotify launched its AI-powered DJ feature. Six months after the North America and Canada debut, it expanded it to dozens of markets across the globe. An English-speaking personalized radio DJ has been a success. Now, Spotify took the next step by launching personalized AI playlists that one can build using written prompts. Moreover, besides allowing users to specify their musical wishes beyond the genre with prompts referencing a range of things, from moods to movie characters, activities, and so on, AI can be used to further refine the result after the list is generated. At first, the feature will be available to U.K. and Australia. Spotify CEO Daniel Ek has also offered many teasers of ways the music streaming company can exploit AI, such as by summarizing podcasts and creating AI-generated audio ads. With AI-powered capabilities, Spotify can personalize its offerings like never before while also gaining the ability to become more efficient such as by significantly lowering the cost that it takes for advertisers to develop new ad formats. In simple words, the DJ feature was merely the beginning of Spotify’s AI journey. Get the latest stock analysis from Benzinga? "

308,AAPL,"Exclusive - Pegatron in talks with Tata to sell its only India iPhone plant, sources say",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-pegatron-talks-tata-sell-111227187.html,"By Munsif Vengattil and Aditya Kalra BENGALURU/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Pegatron is in advanced talks to hand over control of its only iPhone manufacturing facility in India to the Tata Group, said two sources with direct knowledge, marking the Taiwanese firm's latest scale back of its Apple partnership. Under the deal, which has received the backing of Apple, Tata plans to hold at least a 65% stake in a joint venture that will operate the Pegatron plant near Chennai city in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, with the Taiwanese firm providing technical support and holding the rest, one of the sources said. Tata, one the largest conglomerates in India, will operate the joint venture through its Tata Electronics unit, the second source said. The Pegatron India factory has around 10,000 employees and makes 5 million iPhones annually. It is the last such facility operated by the firm after it forfeited control of an iPhone plant in China last year to rival Luxshare in a $290 million deal. Tata and Pegatron did not respond to emailed requests for comments. Apple declined to comment. The sources did not share financial details of the ongoing negotiations. Apple is increasingly looking to diversify its supply chain beyond China amid geopolitical tensions between Beijing and Washington. For India's Tata, the Chennai Pegatron plant will bolster its iPhone manufacturing plans. Tata already operates an iPhone assembly plant in the neighbouring southern state of Karnataka, which it took over from Taiwan's Wistron last year, and is also building another in Hosur in Tamil Nadu, where Pegatron is likely to emerge as its joint venture partner. Pegatron has for months also been building another iPhone factory at its Chennai campus, and the Tata deal talks include taking over that facility as well, the first source said. The talks between Tata and Pegatron for the factory are expected to close in six months and will see all of the Pegatron India employees move to the joint venture entity, the first source added. Apple's iPhone contract manufacturers in India currently include Tata, Pegatron and Foxconn. Tata is key to Apple's growing ambitions in India, which analysts estimate will contribute 20-25% of total iPhone shipments this year, from 12-14% last year. The reasons for Pegatron's gradual withdrawal from its Apple business, including in India, were not known. Last year, Pegatron said the China plant deal was done to raise capital to ""optimise its business"".

315,AAPL,"Meet the Best-Performing ""Magnificent Seven"" Stock Over the Last Month (Hint: It's Not Nvidia)",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meet-best-performing-magnificent-seven-114500442.html,"However, something has changed over the last month. One of the three Magnificent Seven stocks that had been down year to date is suddenly up -- a lot -- over the last month. It has been a wild ride for Alphabet stock in 2024. In late January, it was around the same price it is today -- above $150 a share. But in early March, it fell to the low $130 per-share range due to investor pessimism regarding its artificial intelligence (AI) investments -- specifically, Google Gemini AI and its inaccuracies. Partnering with Apple would be a huge deal for Alphabet. Despite owning various differentiated businesses, like Google Search, YouTube, Google Cloud, and Android, Alphabet still depends on ads for the vast majority of its revenue. The more it can diversify its business away from ads, the wider its moat and the more levers it can pull to unlock growth. At least in the short term, Alphabet stock has moved in and out of favor with Wall Street based on its perceived AI aptitude and potential. In reality, this is a company that has been monetizing AI for some time and has a massive research and development budget and cash to invest in innovation. With so many growth narratives flooding the market, it can be easy to get caught up in implied-growth trajectories and overlook the companies that have already accomplished so much and are earning a ton of profit. In other words, outweighing the unknown and discounting proven winners. Alphabet is a proven winner, but there are question marks surrounding how it will stay a winner in the midst of so much competition. Android is still the dominant operating system globally, but iOS is bigger in core areas like the U.S., and Apple has more control over its hardware and software integration than Alphabet. The glass-half-empty outlook on Alphabet is that it is a market leader across many different industries but that all of its industries are ripe for disruption. It has been the leader in search for decades, but can it maintain pole position in the face of mounting competition from short-video platforms or new competition remains to be seen? Consumers have more entertainment options than ever, so will YouTube lose market share to other streaming sites? Will Google Cloud be able to take market share against its larger peers? These are all valid questions. When you like a company, it's always good to consider the counterargument. Charlie Munger used to talk about the inversion process as a way to expand a line of thinking. Before buying a stock, we usually think about the reasons why the company is a good investment. But inversion would involve thinking about all the reasons why folks would want to sell the stock, why it could go lower, underperform the market, etc. There's usually a halfway decent counterargument to even the best stocks. But sometimes, even bad counterarguments can become dominant market sentiment if the market is pessimistic on a stock as it had been on Alphabet relative to the rest of the Magnificent Seven. Alphabet has an established, cash-cow business model and plenty of ways to monetize AI. It is no stranger to competition, as there are always other companies that want a slice of a high-margin industry. In Alphabet's favor is its inexpensive valuation. It has a mere 26.7 price-to-earnings ratio, slightly above Apple's 26.3 for the second-lowest of the Magnificent Seven stocks. It also has a 28.8 price-to-free-cash-flow (FCF) ratio, also second-lowest behind Apple in the Magnificent Seven. Alphabet may not be the most exciting growth stock out there right now. But what it does have is a profitable business and room to take risks and unlock growth. Alphabet's deep pockets and track record of innovation are reason enough for the stock to not trade at a discount to the S&P 500 (like it does today). Alphabet stock should have never fallen as much as it did. And even now, it looks like a reasonable long-term buy for patient investors. Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this: "

317,AAPL,"Forget Nvidia: Here Are 3 ""Magnificent Seven"" Stocks Wall Street Thinks Will Soar More",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/forget-nvidia-3-magnificent-seven-094500601.html,"It might be surprising that Wall Street is so optimistic about Apple. The tech giant's sales growth has slowed considerably, and its valuation is relatively high, with shares trading at a forward earnings multiple of nearly 26. Wall Street thinks Amazon can move even higher. The consensus price target for the stock is roughly 6.5% above the current share price. Forty-three of the 47 analysts surveyed by LSEG in April rate Amazon as a buy or a strong buy. Generative AI continues to provide a major tailwind for Amazon Web Services (AWS), as customers like to run apps where their data is. Since AWS commands the leading market share among cloud platforms, it's where many organizations are training and deploying their generative AI apps. Amazon's advertising business is also enjoying strong momentum. The company is using AI to boost the relevancy of the ads displayed to customers. It has also expanded advertising on Prime Video. The average analyst's 12-month price target is nearly 6% higher than the current price. Wall Street is overwhelmingly bullish about the tech stock, with 38 of the 43 analysts surveyed by LSEG in April rating Alphabet as a buy or a strong buy. Alphabet's Google unit has experienced a couple of embarrassments with its generative AI apps -- first, with Bard last year, and more recently, with Gemini earlier this year. However, these missteps don't seem to have concerned analysts very much. They're more focused on the growth opportunities for Google Cloud and Google's continued dominance in search. Some also have great long-term expectations for Alphabet's Waymo self-driving car business. You can't depend on Wall Street's price targets. Even highly paid analysts focused on scrutinizing companies' operations can't predict the future with a high level of accuracy. However, I suspect Wall Street could be right about Apple, Amazon, and Alphabet. They could be right about Nvidia, too. Nvidia could continue to soar higher, but competition is increasing. Any hiccup could cause the stock to tumble. I think Apple's shares could jump on good news at the upcoming developer conference. Amazon and Alphabet should deliver solid growth in the next few quarters, largely due to the generative AI tailwinds. Wall Street isn't always right. In this case, though, I agree with the analysts' takes on these Magnificent Seven stocks. Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this: "

Rising competition. Widening scrutiny. Apple is falling flat in China and with investors, as the shine comes off of the once darling stock. Shares of the tech giant have declined 8.5% this year, wiping more than $300 billion from its market capitalization, and underperforming the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100. However, not all is lost. The stock correction is making Apple's valuation more attractive, analysts say, and it's not out of the question that the company wows the world again with new offerings. Currently, Apple's stock has fallen 14% from its December peak of $198.11, compared to the S&P 500’s 10% gain and the Nasdaq 100’s nearly 9% climb during the same time. A number of factors have unnerved investors, including sluggish iPhone demand, intensifying Chinese competition, and heightened regulatory scrutiny, Needham analyst Laura Martin told Yahoo Finance Live. The growing list of obstacles has prompted more than a few of Martin’s peers to become more bearish on the stock in the short-term. Goldman Sachs removed Apple from its Conviction List last month, while Barclays, Piper Sandler, and Redburn Atlantic were among firms that have downgraded the stock in 2024. Earlier this week, Loop Capital analyst Ananda Baruah cut his price target on Apple to $170 from $185, and lowered his earnings estimates, writing in a client note that lackluster demand, ""softer fundamentals,"" and competition from Huawei and Xiaomi are having a ""material impact."" ""iPhone unit shipments are simply too soft,"" Baruah wrote. ""We currently believe that both Street iPhone units and revenue [estimates] could be 20% too high, and that Wall Street’s overall revenue and EPS [estimates] could be 10% too high."" Baruah expects Apple's annual revenue and earnings to decline in 2024 — which has not happened since 2016. TECHnalysis Research's Bob O’Donnell told Yahoo Finance Live that the road ahead for Apple will be challenging, as the region contributed nearly one-fifth of the tech giant’s overall revenue in its most recent quarter. ""I think the next couple of quarters is going to be tough,"" O’Donnell said. ""I'm hoping that Apple will pull a rabbit out of its hat. It's done so in the past, and I'm not convinced it can't do that now."" Despite waning excitement on Wall Street, now may be the time to bet on Apple. The recent selloff has put its shares at a discount, Piper Sandler chief market technician Craig Johnson told Yahoo Finance Live, giving it a more attractive risk-reward set up. ""Apple looks like a pretty attractive place for people to park their money at this point in time, because it’s got a great balance sheet, a highly repeatable business model, good margins, and they're buying back quite a bit of stock,"" Johnson explained. Beyond its solid balance sheet, several analysts remain confident in the company's ability to regain momentum. The Vision Pro headset and anticipated AI initiatives are largely viewed as future revenue growth drivers, along with additional sources of revenue, including a potential advertising push. ""Maybe demand is slower in China, but it has really wealthy demographics already using their ecosystem, so they need to add advertising to drive revenue growth,"" Martin said. ""Apple needs to figure out a way to add more services and software so it can get more subscription revenue and up its revenue per device."" Martin is among a shortened list of analysts who have maintained a buy rating on Apple.

322,AAPL,Apple Winds Down Spending in 1 Key Area Where Meta Has Been Surprisingly Transparent,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-winds-down-spending-1-110700787.html,"According to widely reported information from a series of leaked internal notifications, Apple is apparently scrapping two big R&D projects that have been the source of all sorts of Apple product fan excitement (or speculation) for years. Project Titan, the code name for an Apple self-driving electric car, or at least some sort of underlying technology, is being wound down. Likewise, longtime work on microLED technology for use in products like the Apple Watch is also being scrapped. Of course, investors who peel back Apple's spending habits probably could have guessed sweeping changes were coming. After a couple of decades of R&D increases since the iPhone was announced in 2007, a new era of financial efficiency appears to be beginning for Apple. R&D expenses actually declined in the last year. Meanwhile, Meta has also been enjoying the fruit of CEO Mark Zuckerberg's work on becoming a more efficient business -- although R&D is overall still on the rise. It seems Apple is ready to pivot as well, and pare back some spending in favor of driving higher profit margins. Perhaps we'll get some clearer direction on future project developments from CEO Tim Cook and company, too. Apple's ROIC has gone through the roof in recent years as its mobile product lineup matures. Based on this track record of successful innovation and new product commercialization, investors should hope Apple redeploys R&D spending from its scrapped car and mobile display experiments to something new. ROIC of over 50% is mind-bogglingly good. Imagine if you, an individual investor, invested $1, and received $0.50 from that investment every year going forward. That's the kind of return Apple is getting from its development efforts right now. Granted, like all things in investing, past results are not indicative of future performance. Nevertheless, with a large global user base of its products, Apple has ample room to bring more products and services (say, an AI assistant, one better than Siri) to market and make more money. In the meantime, as 2024 rolls on and as more news surfaces about Apple cutting costs, investors' best hope for the stock making a rally may be in good old-fashioned earnings growth -- exactly the secret to Meta's resurgence the last couple of years. Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this: "
323,AAPL,"Here's the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock I Think Will Be the Next to Join Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta in the $1 Trillion Club",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-artificial-intelligence-ai-stock-094500701.html,"Few groups are as exclusive as the $1 trillion club. This club has only six members, each a U.S. company with a market capitalization of at least $1 trillion. However, the $1 trillion mark isn't out of reach for Broadcom. The semiconductor and infrastructure software maker's market cap currently tops $610 billion. Sure, the stock needs to jump another 64% or so. But considering Broadcom's shares have more than doubled over the last 12 months, delivering the required gain to join the $1 trillion club doesn't seem too tall a task. Competition in China has intensified, causing Tesla to cut prices to avoid being outflanked. Big automakers in the U.S. are ramping up their EV production. Perhaps most concerning is that consumer interest in buying EVs seems to have stalled. I suspect Taiwan Semi presents a greater threat to beat Broadcom to $1 trillion. The semiconductor maker's market cap is close to $620 billion, neck and neck with Broadcom's. Both companies should benefit from a strong continued demand for chips to power AI applications. However, several rivals are attempting to reduce Taiwan Semi's market dominance. Mainland China's ambition to retake Taiwan could negatively impact Taiwan Semi stock as well as push U.S. and European customers to competitors. Broadcom's risks seem relatively minor compared to those of Taiwan Semi. The company's acquisition of VMware should fuel accelerated growth. Broadcom's main problem is declining broadband sales and telecommunications companies reducing their spending. Since I predict that Broadcom will be the next AI stock to join the $1 trillion club, do I also view the stock as a buy right now? Actually, no. My concern with Broadcom is its valuation. Shares trade at nearly 29 times forward earnings. Yes, the company should generate strong growth over the next few years. Unfortunately, Broadcom's price still isn't compelling to me even with that growth factored in. I expect the company could take longer to reach a market cap of $1 trillion than many investors would like. Before you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this: "
324,AAPL,Apple to let music streaming apps in Europe link to own websites for purchases,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-let-music-streaming-apps-215635092.html,"By Granth Vanaik (Reuters) - Apple announced measures on Friday to make it easier for music streaming apps on its App Store in the European Economic Area to inform users of other ways to purchase digital services, as it looks to comply with a European Union mandate. The announcement comes weeks after the iPhone maker was fined 1.84 billion euros ($1.99 billion) by the EU for thwarting competition from music streaming rivals via restrictions on its App Store. The European Commission had said in March that Apple's restrictions constituted unfair trading conditions and that it should stop such conduct. Following a 2019 complaint by Swedish streaming service Spotify, the Commission charged Apple last year with preventing the Swedish company and others from informing users of payment options outside its App Store. Apple on Friday said it would permit music streaming app developers to invite users to provide their email address for sending them a link to the developer's website to purchase digital music content or services, and to inform them about where and how to purchase items as well as the price. The company said that the announcement provides ""even more"" flexibility to music streaming service apps, including Spotify, which has 56% share of the European market. Spotify did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Apple, however, said the Commission's decision does not address its ability to charge a commission for all the tools, technologies and ongoing services it provides.

325,AAPL,Apple asks US appeals court to reverse Apple Watch import ban,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-asks-us-appeals-court-214822462.html,"By Blake Brittain (Reuters) - Apple urged a U.S. appeals court on Friday to overturn a U.S. trade tribunal's decision to ban imports of some Apple Watches in a patent dispute with medical-monitoring technology company Masimo. Apple told the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit that the U.S. International Trade Commission's decision was based on a ""series of substantively defective patent rulings,"" and that Masimo failed to show it had invested in making competing U.S. products that would justify the order. Representatives for Apple and Masimo did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the filing. Irvine, California-based Masimo has accused Apple of hiring away its employees and stealing its pulse oximetry technology after discussing a potential collaboration. Apple first introduced pulse oximetry to its Series 6 Apple Watches in 2020. Masimo convinced the ITC on Dec. 26 to block imports of Apple's latest-edition Series 9 and Ultra 2 smartwatches after finding that their technology for reading blood-oxygen levels infringed Masimo's patents. Apple temporarily resumed sales of the watches the next day after persuading the Federal Circuit to pause the ban. The appeals court reinstated the ban in January, leading Apple to remove pulse oximetry capabilities from watches sold during the appeal, which Apple has said could last at least a year. U.S. Customs and Border Protection separately determined in January that redesigned versions of the watches did not violate Masimo's rights and would not be not subject to the ban. Masimo said in a court filing that the watches ""definitively do not contain pulse oximetry functionality."" Apple told the Federal Circuit on Friday that the ban could not stand because a Masimo wearable covered by the patents was ""purely hypothetical"" when it filed its ITC complaint in 2021. The tech giant also argued that Masimo's patents were invalid and that its watches did not infringe them. (Reporting by Blake Brittain in Washington, Editing by Alexia Garamfalvi and Josie Kao) "

327,AAPL,Amazon MGM partners with YouTuber MrBeast to stream 'Beast Games',https://finance.yahoo.com/video/amazon-mgm-partners-youtuber-mrbeast-213526676.html,"Pastor emphasizes that it is an ""unbelievable time"" to be a part of the media industry, given the tremendous amount of change underway. Drawing on his experience dating back to when cable was emerging, Pastor notes that streaming is now ""the topic du jour."" Regarding the MrBeast deal, Pastor explains that projects with ""stars attached"" to them in Hollywood tend to reduce risk and boost engagement, stressing that the Amazon-MrBeast collaboration is a ""tried and true"" model. However, he highlights that this deal also opens the door for other content creators on YouTube to ""build out incredible franchises"" beyond just the YouTube platform itself— which will benefit both the influencer class and the production companies involved. And Paul, thank you so much for joining us. First of all, just to set the stage here. Talk to us about what Quickplay does and sort of your view on the streaming industry from where you sit. So what is a tier one operator means? It means somebody who has a very complex ecosystem that's maybe managing legacy systems and legacy business models, as well as current and future ones with streaming. They happen to have really-- they want control of their roadmap, and they want to make sure that they can respond to the various needs of their consumers. And importantly, they have very big executives who often come in with a request or demand that are looking for new features, new innovations that lead the market. And they're looking for platforms like ourselves to help them drive that change in their organization. In terms of the industry, it's an unbelievable time to be involved in the industry. We're seeing a tremendous amount of change. I started in the industry when cable was being developed. And then we had digital terrestrial television. That was in the process of transforming the industry. And now, most of the business models that I set up maybe 20 years ago have now folded as now streaming becomes the topic Du Jour. But there's a tremendous number of trends in the industry at this moment that I'm sure you're seeing. First and foremost, obviously, there's a tremendous amount of focus on cost at this moment where streamers are rationalizing their content investment, their marketing investment, and importantly, their technology investment. Second, you've seen a tremendous amount of consolidation in industry where people are looking to aggregate in order to offer a better value proposition to consumers. And then fundamentally, there is the management and focus on profitability as they sunset many of their older businesses that were huge profit drivers and transform these into their new profit drivers. So this is a very tried and true model. What Amazon has done and stealing the talent from YouTube or borrowing or leveraging the brand from YouTube into their program with a huge prize. They made a huge splash. But let's not forget that there's other businesses that are out there that are fundamentally pursuing the very same thing, which is how to democratize content through YouTube like a pocket watch or a Moonbug that focus on the kids area, but then build out these incredible franchises that they then take to more traditional streaming or traditional media platforms. Another one you sell was Morphy. For example, that was announced this year coming from YouTube from Moonbug that will now be available on Disney and Disney Plus. So this is most certainly a model that Hollywood is familiar with. It presents a great opportunity, obviously, for influencers and those who build their brands in these more democratized platforms to be able to extend that IP, to extend their talents, and really grow what is basically a production company and franchise business through these other various platforms.

Keep a few things in mind, though. For starters, that big, fat one-year return of nearly 39% isn't to be expected very often, if at all. Also, you'll see that over the past three years, the Vanguard Growth ETF underperformed the S&P 500. And its future performance is in no way guaranteed to follow past performance. The ETF has an expense ratio (an annual fee) of 0.04%, which is quite low, costing $4 per $10,000 invested. Since it holds many different stocks, plenty of which pay dividends, it passes those dividends on to shareholders. The ETF's dividend yield is about 0.5%. The strong stock performance of late has depressed the dividend yield. The Vanguard Growth ETF's portfolio features 208 stocks, with a median market value near $715 billion. So it's focused on large-cap companies -- and relatively fast-growing ones.

330,AAPL,Apple Supplier Reports Revenue Dip But Expects Growth Ahead As The AI Revolution Created Room For Contributors,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-supplier-reports-revenue-dip-201444038.html,"First quarter highlights For the first quarter, Foxconn posted a 9.6% drop in revenue, however, Apple supplier noted that its cloud and networking segment reported significant revenue growth. But total revenue amounted to 1.32 trillion New Taiwan dollars which equates to about $41.2 billion and it was also 28.58% lower compared to the previous, fourth, quarter. But, fourth quarter is usually when suppliers race to enable tech giants like Apple to satisfy the holiday demand. But, according to Counterpoint Research, overall shipments if smartphones declined 3.2% during 2023. The AI hype is in the air As a reminder, Foxconn teamed up with Nvidia last year. Foxconn and Nvidia joined class to develop certain “AI factories” which are a new class of data centers that use Nvidia chips to power all kinds of applications ranging from large language models to training autonomous vehicles. Also, Foxconn will develop smart solution platforms that are based on technologies that Nvidia developed. By gaining access to Nvidia’s solutions, Foxconn will get to offer safe AI-powered EVs and make its mark in the new era. In simple words, Nvidia joined forces with Foxconn on its path to accelerate the AI Industrial Revolution. Considering that AI development requires more than chips, there is room for all kinds of industrial contributors as even the all-mighty Nvidia cannot do everything alone, which bodes well for Foxconn. Despite the traditional off-peak period and a recent earthquake, higher March revenue from consumer-electronics and cloud demand fueled Apple supplier to expect revenue growth in the second quarter. Also, Foxconn shares rose almost 21% year-to-date. Rebound hopes are based on AI Although the sales slump offers little hope for the rebound of the Apple star, the iPhone, , the growing demand for AI servers empowered Foxconn to expect a revenue rebound in the second quarter and be optimistic for the year ahead.

332,AAPL,Foxconn posts 9.6% revenue decline in Q1,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/foxconn-posts-9-6-revenue-152834014.html,"But I think perhaps it's more focused on how Foxconn is going to deliver for them on the second half of this year, part of the year where they typically have a lot of their larger announcements, especially on the hardware, handset, smartphone, wearables devices as well typically. So taking into account that some of that bad news or some of that worry had already been priced in actually over the last five days still up just about 1%, but year-to-date still in the red. Analysts getting a bit more bearish on Apple, at least in the short-term. You talk about the fact that we do see falling demand or saturated demand here in the US, and then taking a look at what's happening over in China, obviously, sluggish demand there, rising competition. And then also the fact that the lackluster in terms of excitement surrounding their new products, What is exactly going to take to get iPhone users who currently have an iPhone to upgrade? And there's lots of questions about whether or not this next cycle that we will likely get in the fall if that will be enough to kind of change some of that momentum. So many more analysts than we had seen over the last several months have been moving to the sideline on this name Apple. And I think we're seeing some of that lackluster demand reflected in Foxconn's results today. "
333,AAPL,Apple lets go of 600 workers in California,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/apple-lets-600-workers-california-144606884.html,"And Seana, what I think is particularly interesting about this, is that these are notices that are filed with the state of California. So we know right now that it's 600 jobs but it could be significantly more given that some employees could be in other places of the country of course. And we're anticipating that this is again related to project Titan, the cars project. But also the display project as well that they were working on, so curious to see how this number kind of develops long term and what the scope of it is. We have certainly seen a number of these larger tech companies announce layoffs actually. I mean, take a look at the tech sector, that sector accounted for the largest portion of job cuts of any of the major sectors here in Q1. So I think the question a lot of people are asking, when we talk about the resilience overall of the labor market is whether or not some of that trend that we saw in terms of trimming headcount in the first quarter specifically within the tech sector, whether or not we are going to see a further contraction within tech with an employee headcount? Or if we're going to start to see a shift? If it's leveled out just a bit, we were talking to one of LinkedIn's economists earlier in last hour. And he was talking about the fact that he does expect that to level off just a bit, that tech companies are hiring once again and hiring has increased just a bit or interest to hire has increased a little bit on their platform. But when you've got a big name like Apple, that is cutting jobs here. It's grabbing the attention, refocusing some of its focus here in terms of the AI initiatives. It's going to make investors think twice just about what some of those longer term goals are here for the company. "

335,AAPL,1 Wall Street Analyst Thinks This Magnificent Seven Stock Is Going to $220. Is It a buy Around $169?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-wall-street-analyst-thinks-134500868.html,"More than a few analysts tracking the stock believe in the company's future too. One of them recently reiterated his view that the shares could appreciate by 30%. Even for Apple, however, that's a chunky growth rate. Is it realistically achievable? Following an update from Apple on the performance of its App Store, Evercore ISI's Amit Daryanani felt compelled to publish a fresh research note on the company. Furthermore, the prognosticator wrote in his note that ""the strength of the March print increases our confidence that Apple can maintain App Store growth in the double digits."" Daryanani's positive take on Apple is in some contrast to the more cautious analysts tracking the stock. Some are concerned that the once-mighty iPhone is losing a bit of its luster due to weakening demand and lower-priced competition. The device did see a 24% year-over-year tumble in sales in the crucial market of China in the first six weeks of this year, after all. As a longtime Apple bull and determined holder of the stock, I lean more toward Daryanani's argument. Hardware sales are critical and foundational, of course, but the company has made bigger strides with services. These grew by 11% year-over-year in the company's most recently reported quarter, against the essentially stagnant development of product sales. This should buoy the company's overall growth, and keep its investors sweet. Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this: "

337,AAPL,Key analyst says latest Apple move would be a 'horror show',https://finance.yahoo.com/news/key-analyst-says-latest-apple-133554874.html,"Teams of engineers, according to the report, have been working on developing a small, personal robot that would follow people around their homes. The project is still in its early research phase. People familiar with the project told Bloomberg that the personal robotics push could be the ""next big thing"" for the company, though the report added that Apple has yet to commit to the project. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ""It would be a horror show if they actually spent money on robots,"" Ives said. ""They need to focus on AI."" Ives added that Apple CEO Tim Cook's ""legacy is going to be AI. If they went after robots, that would be a black-eye moment for Apple."" Ives, who has remained bullish on Apple despite recent stock pressure, is convinced that AI is the real next big thing for the iPhone makers. “We believe the 'Super Bowl moment for Apple' will be when Cook & Co. finally take the covers off the generative AI technology being worked on in the labs of Apple Park and introduce it to developers and consumers at WWDC in June followed by the exclusive AI features we expect to be included on iPhone 16,” Ives said in a February note. Ives said in a note Thursday that the AI revolution is in full swing. He expects tech stocks to rise another 15% for the year. Deepwater Management's Gene Munster, unlike Ives, said Thursday that it makes sense for Apple to have a small project to explore home automation. But he doesn't expect it to amount to much. Shares of Apple, down around 12% for the year, closed Thursday down slightly. The stock pushed up around .7% in pre-market trading Friday morning. "

In February, Apple announced internally that it was canceling its effort to build an electric car, dubbed Project Titan, according to Bloomberg. The company spent billions of dollars on the project, and the move surprised the nearly 2,000 employees who were working on it, Bloomberg also reported. The outlet said that some of the workers would be redirected to focus on Apple's generative artificial intelligence division, while others will be laid off. In 2017, Apple CEO Tim Cook confirmed that the company was working on autonomous systems that could have applications in the self-driving car segment. That year, Apple obtained a permit from the state of California to test vehicles equipped with self-driving equipment on public roads. But ultimately, top executives decided in February of this year to scrap the project after it reached a ""make-or-break point,"" Bloomberg reported. Apple did not immediately respond Friday to a request for comment from FOX Business. "
339,AAPL,Apple axes 600 jobs after giving up on electric cars,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-axes-600-jobs-giving-101433336.html,"The redundancies are the first at Apple since the pandemic and are happening at Silicon Valley offices believed to house parts of its electric car project. A team working on new screen technology is also being shut down. Apple revealed the lay-offs in state filings in California. The project was launched in secret in 2014 and has since gone through repeated restructurings and leadership changes as Apple grappled with how to enter the fiercely competitive automotive industry. At one point, Apple had planned to build a fully autonomous vehicle that could drive itself. The company operated a test fleet of self-driving cars on California’s roads. Last year, it had 67 Lexus SUVs registered with Californian officials that had been vetted to test its software. The cars remain more expensive than petrol equivalents at the budget end of the market, while high inflation has dampened demand for new cars overall. The job cuts at Apple include hundreds of roles in the Californian city of Santa Clara, according to state filings. Earlier this year, Apple also cut 121 jobs from an office in San Diego. Unlike other tech giants such as Google and Meta, Apple has largely avoided such public mass redundancies. While it has given up on its electric vehicle dream, Apple has shifted its efforts towards embedding more powerful artificial intelligence technology in its gadgets. Apple’s shares have languished so far this year as investors grow wary over its growth potential. Its stock is down 9pc since the turn of the year and it has lost its place as the world’s most valuable company. "
340,AAPL,Inside Big Tech's underground race to buy AI training data,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/inside-big-techs-underground-race-100603768.html,"By Katie Paul and Anna Tong NEW YORK (Reuters) - At its peak in the early 2000s, Photobucket was the world's top image-hosting site. The media backbone for once-hot services like Myspace and Friendster, it boasted 70 million users and accounted for nearly half of the U.S. online photo market. Today only 2 million people still use Photobucket, according to analytics tracker Similarweb. But the generative AI revolution may give it a new lease of life. CEO Ted Leonard, who runs the 40-strong company out of Edwards, Colorado, told Reuters he is in talks with multiple tech companies to license Photobucket's 13 billion photos and videos to be used to train generative AI models that can produce new content in response to text prompts. He has discussed rates of between 5 cents and $1 dollar per photo and more than $1 per video, he said, with prices varying widely both by the buyer and the types of imagery sought. ""We've spoken to companies that have said, 'we need way more,' Leonard added, with one buyer telling him they wanted over a billion videos, more than his platform has. ""You scratch your head and say, where do you get that?"" Photobucket declined to identify its prospective buyers, citing commercial confidentiality. The ongoing negotiations, which haven't been previously reported, suggest the company could be sitting on billions of dollars' worth of content and give a glimpse into a bustling data market that's arising in the rush to dominate generative AI technology. Tech giants like Google, Meta and Microsoft-backed OpenAI initially used reams of data scraped from the internet for free to train generative AI models like ChatGPT that can mimic human creativity. They have said that doing so is both legal and ethical, though they face lawsuits from a string of copyright holders over the practice. At the same time, these tech companies are also quietly paying for content locked behind paywalls and login screens, giving rise to a hidden trade in everything from chat logs to long forgotten personal photos from faded social media apps. ""There is a rush right now to go for copyright holders that have private collections of stuff that is not available to be scraped,"" said Edward Klaris from law firm Klaris Law, which says it's advising content owners on deals worth tens of millions of dollars apiece to license archives of photos, movies and books for AI training. Reuters spoke to more than 30 people with knowledge of AI data deals, including current and former executives at companies involved, lawyers and consultants, to provide the first in-depth exploration of this fledgling market - detailing the types of content being bought, the prices materializing, plus emerging concerns about the risk of personal data making its way into AI models without people's knowledge or explicit consent. OpenAI, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Apple and Amazon all declined to comment on specific data deals and discussions for this article, although Microsoft and Google referred Reuters to supplier codes of conduct that include data-privacy provisions. Google added that it would ""take immediate action, up to and including termination"" of its agreement with a supplier if it discovered a violation. Many major market research firms say they have not even begun to estimate the size of the opaque AI data market, where companies often don't disclose agreements. Those researchers who do, such as Business Research Insights, put the market at roughly $2.5 billion now and forecast it could grow close to $30 billion within a decade. GENERATIVE DATA GOLD RUSH The data land grab comes as makers of big generative AI ""foundation"" models face increasing pressure to account for the massive amounts of content they feed into their systems, a process known as ""training"" that requires intensive computing power and often takes months to complete. Tech companies say the technology would be cost-prohibitive if they couldn't use vast archives of free scraped web page data, such as those provided by non-profit repository Common Crawl, which they describe as ""publicly available."" Their approach has nonetheless drawn a wave of copyright lawsuits and regulatory heat, while prompting publishers to add code to their websites to block scraping. In response, AI model makers have started hedging risks and securing data-supply chains, both through deals with content owners and via a burgeoning industry of data brokers that has popped up to satisfy demand. In the months after ChatGPT debuted in late 2022, for instance, companies including Meta, Google, Amazon and Apple all struck agreements with stock image provider Shutterstock to use hundreds of millions of images, videos and music files in its library for training, according to a person familiar with the arrangements. The deals with Big Tech firms initially ranged from $25 million to $50 million each, though most were later expanded, Shutterstock's Chief Financial Officer Jarrod Yahes told Reuters. Smaller tech players have followed suit, spurring a fresh ""flurry of activity"" in the past two months, he added. Yahes declined to comment on individual contracts. The Apple agreement, and the size of the other deals, haven't previously been made public. A Shutterstock competitor, Freepik, told Reuters it had struck agreements with two large tech companies to license the majority of its archive of 200 million images at 2 to 4 cents per image. There are five more similar deals in the pipeline, said CEO Joaquin Cuenca Abela, declining to identify buyers. OpenAI, an early Shutterstock customer, has also signed licensing agreements with at least four news organizations, including The Associated Press and Axel Springer. Thomson Reuters, the owner of Reuters News, separately said it has struck deals to license news content to help train AI large language models, but didn't disclose details. 'ETHICALLY SOURCED' CONTENT An industry of dedicated AI data firms is emerging too, securing rights to real-world content like podcasts, short-form videos and interactions with digital assistants, while also building networks of short-term contract workers to produce custom visuals and voice samples from scratch, akin to an Uber-esque gig economy for data. Seattle-based Defined.ai licenses data to a range of companies including Google, Meta, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft, CEO Daniela Braga told Reuters. Rates vary by buyer and content type, but Braga said companies are generally willing to pay $1 to $2 per image, $2 to $4 per short-form video and $100 to $300 per hour of longer films. The market rate for text is $0.001 per word, she added. Images of nudity, which require the most sensitive handling, go for $5 to $7, she said. Defined.ai splits those earnings with content providers, Braga said. It markets its datasets as ""ethically sourced,"" as it obtains consent from people whose data it uses and strips out personally identifying information, she added. One of the firm's suppliers, a Brazil-based entrepreneur, said he pays owners of the photos, podcasts and medical data he sources about 20% to 30% of total deal amounts. The priciest images in his portfolio are those used to train AI systems that block content like graphic violence barred by the tech companies, said the supplier, who spoke on condition his company wasn't identified, citing commercial sensitivity. To fulfill those requests, he obtains images of crime scenes, conflict violence and surgeries - mainly from police, freelance photojournalists and medical students, respectively - often in places in South America and Africa where distributing graphic images is more common, he said. He said he has received images from freelance photographers in Gaza since the start of the war there in October, plus some from Israel at the outset of hostilities. His company hires nurses accustomed to seeing violent injuries to anonymize and annotate the images, which are disturbing to untrained eyes, he added. 'I WOULD FIND IT RISKY' While licensing could resolve some legal and ethical issues, resurrecting the archives of old internet names like Photobucket as fuel for the latest AI models raises others, particularly around user privacy, according to many of the industry players interviewed. AI systems have been caught regurgitating exact copies of their training data, spitting out, for example, the Getty Images watermark, verbatim paragraphs of New York Times articles and images of real people. That means a person's private photos or intimate thoughts posted decades ago could potentially wind up in generative AI outputs without notice or explicit consent. Photobucket CEO Leonard says he is on solid legal ground, citing an update to the company's terms of service in October that grants it the ""unrestricted right"" to sell any uploaded content for the purpose of training AI systems. He sees licensing data as an alternative to selling ads. ""We need to pay our bills, and this could give us the ability to continue to support free accounts,"" he said. Defined.ai's Braga said she avoids acquiring content from ""platform"" companies like Photobucket and prefers to source social media photos from influencers who create them, who she said have a clearer claim to licensing rights. ""I would find it very risky,"" Braga said of platform content. ""If there's some AI that generates something that resembles a picture of someone who never approved that, that's a problem."" Photobucket is not alone among platforms in embracing licensing. Tumblr's parent company Automattic said last month it was sharing content with ""select AI companies."" In February, Reuters reported Reddit struck a deal with Google to make its content available for training the latter's AI models. Ahead of its initial public offering in March, Reddit disclosed that its data-licensing business is the subject of a U.S. Federal Trade Commission inquiry and acknowledged it could fall foul of evolving privacy and intellectual-property regulations. The FTC, which warned businesses in February against retroactively changing terms of service for AI usage, declined to comment on the Reddit inquiry or say whether it was looking into other training data deals.

342,AAPL,INSIGHT-Inside Big Tech's underground race to buy AI training data,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/insight-inside-big-techs-underground-100002984.html,"By Katie Paul and Anna Tong NEW YORK, April 5 (Reuters) - At its peak in the early 2000s, Photobucket was the world's top image-hosting site. The media backbone for once-hot services like Myspace and Friendster, it boasted 70 million users and accounted for nearly half of the U.S. online photo market. Today only 2 million people still use Photobucket, according to analytics tracker Similarweb. But the generative AI revolution may give it a new lease of life. CEO Ted Leonard, who runs the 40-strong company out of Edwards, Colorado, told Reuters he is in talks with multiple tech companies to license Photobucket's 13 billion photos and videos to be used to train generative AI models that can produce new content in response to text prompts.

343,AAPL,Forget Apple: Warren Buffett Has Spent Twice as Much Buying Shares of This Beloved Stock Since 2018,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/forget-apple-warren-buffett-spent-090600538.html,"Both professional and retail investors frequently await Berkshire's quarterly Form 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to gain an understanding of what stocks Buffett and his top investment aides, Ted Weschler and Todd Combs, have been buying and selling. While Buffett is just as fallible as any other investor, he's demonstrated a knack for finding value in plain sight. Let me preface this discussion by noting that Warren Buffett and his team of investors absolutely love Apple as a business. In fact, Buffett himself described Apple as ""a better business than any we own"" during Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting last year. It's why an estimated $36 billion has been put to work by Buffett and Co. in shares of Apple since the start of 2016. There's also the domestic dominance of Apple's iPhone. Since introducing an iPhone that supports 5G speeds in the fourth quarter of 2020, Apple has consistently accounted for a 50% or greater share of the U.S. smartphone market. However, the company's future growth boils down to its shift to subscription services. Although Apple has no intention of abandoning the physical products that brought it fame (the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple Watch), focusing on subscription services should provide a lift to its operating margin, enhance the value of its product and service ecosystem, and keep customers loyal to its brand. But if you asked Warren Buffett to pinpoint the one aspect about Apple he loves most, it wouldn't be the least bit surprising if he flagged Apple's market-leading share repurchase program. Since initiating a buyback program in 2013, Apple has bought back about $651 billion worth of its common stock. Not only do buybacks help reduce the number of shares outstanding, which can provide a lift to earnings per share (EPS), they're a means to increase the ownership stakes of existing shareholders. As time passes, Berkshire is becoming a larger stakeholder in Apple without having to buy a single share. But the fact remains that the estimated $36 billion Warren Buffett and his team have put to work in Apple over the past eight years takes a back seat to an even more loved stock. Truth be told, Berkshire Hathaway's 13Fs fail to tell the full story about the company's holdings or what the Oracle of Omaha has been doing with Berkshire's cash. For a more encompassing view, investors will need to dive into Berkshire Hathaway's quarterly operating results. Just prior to the executive certifications at the end of Berkshire Hathaway's quarterly earnings reports is a section on the company's share repurchase activity. The reason I bring this up is because Warren Buffett has spent considerably more buying back Berkshire Hathaway stock than he and his top aides have spent purchasing shares of any other stock, including Apple. During the December-ended quarter, Buffett gave the green light for the repurchase of 3,623 shares of Berkshire's Class A stock and 660,585 shares of Class B stock (BRK.B), which came at a cost of almost $2.15 billion. Since the midpoint of 2018, Buffett and his late right-hand man, Charlie Munger, who he referred to as the ""Architect of Berkshire Hathaway"" in his latest annual letter to shareholders, OK'd the repurchase of more than $74 billion worth of their own company's shares. That's more than twice the amount spent buying shares of Apple. Prior to July 2018, Berkshire's share repurchase program only allowed the Oracle of Omaha to buy shares of his company if they traded at or below 120% of book value (no more than 20% of reported book value in the most recent quarter). Since Berkshire stock never fell to or below this threshold, Warren Buffett was forced to sit on his hands and go years without repurchasing a single share. On July 17, 2018, Berkshire's board reworked its buyback criteria: As long as Berkshire Hathaway has at least $30 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and Treasuries on its balance sheet; and Warren Buffett and the late Charlie Munger agree their stock is intrinsically cheap, buybacks can be made without any end date or ceiling. Suffice it to say, more than $74 billion in share repurchases over the last 22 quarters makes it plainly obvious that Berkshire Hathaway is Warren Buffett's favorite stock to buy. Since Buffett's company doesn't pay a dividend, share buybacks are the easiest way he can reward investors who share his long-term vision. These buybacks are slowly but steadily increasing the ownership stakes of Berkshire's shareholders, as well as increasing EPS. In other words, putting his company's cash to work via buybacks is making Berkshire Hathaway more attractive to fundamentally focused investors. With a record $167.6 billion in available cash, cash equivalents, and Treasuries on the balance sheet, as of the end of 2023, Buffett has more than enough firepower to continue buying back shares of his company.

344,AAPL,Hon Hai Sales Fall Short of Estimates After iPhone Slump,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hon-hai-sales-fall-short-081702325.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. missed revenue estimates in the first quarter after being dragged down by sagging iPhone sales, especially in China. Most Read from Bloomberg The biggest iPhone contract manufacturer, also known as Foxconn, said that its March sales were NT$447.5 billion ($14 billion), bringing first-quarter revenue to NT$1.32 trillion, down 9.6% and short of an average of analyst estimates of NT$1.39 trillion. Sales in March rose 11.8% on the prior year after declining by double-digit percentages in the first two months of 2024, and smart consumer electronics sales showed “strong growth,” Taipei-based Hon Hai said in a filing Friday. The company is diversifying its business with greater focus on building data center server racks and other equipment for artificial intelligence clusters. That’s helped its stock reach a record high this year, despite sales of Apple Inc.’s flagship device waning in China, the world’s largest smartphone market. For the current quarter, Hon Hai said it expects sales to grow relative to the same period a year earlier — in line with projections for an 8% rise. The company also anticipates sales to be up for the full year. The AI craze has brought big gains in companies like Nvidia Corp. as investors see massive growth potential for the sector. Foxconn’s AI server revenue is likely to account for 18% of its total sales in 2025, due to a rising share of Nvidia shipments, JPMorgan analysts including Gokul Hariharan wrote in a note late March. Still, with Apple’s business making up more than half of Hon Hai revenue, challenges remain. iPhone shipments in China fell 33% in February, to only about 2.4 million, according to official data. To stimulate demand, Apple even rolled out rare discounts on its web store in January, and online resellers are now cutting prices by as much as $180.

345,AAPL,UPDATE 1-Apple supplier Foxconn sees growth in Q2 after dip in Q1 revenue,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-apple-supplier-foxconn-sees-081413968.html,"(Updates throughout with context, quotes and details on performance in smart consumer electronics products) TAIPEI, April 5 (Reuters) - Taiwan's Foxconn, the world's largest contract electronics maker and the biggest assembler of Apple's iPhone, said on Friday it expected a rise in second quarter revenue after the previous quarter underperformed market expectations. The first quarter is traditionally quieter than the previous one, the season when Taiwan's tech companies race to supply smartphones, tablets and other electronics to major vendors such as Apple for Western markets' year-end holiday period. Foxconn said in a statement that this year's second quarter ""remains a traditional off-peak season, and major products are entering a period of transition between old and new products"". But it said the outlook for the second quarter would be for growth both quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year. It did not elaborate and the company does not give numerical guidance. The company, formally called Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, said revenue last month reached T$447.54 billion ($13.96 billion), which it said was the second highest figure on record for the same period and represented an on-year rise of 11.8%. For the first quarter, revenue slid 9.6% year-on-year to T$1.322 trillion, underperforming a T$1.401 trillion LSEG SmartEstimate, which gives greater weight to forecasts from analysts who are more consistently accurate. The company said last month it expected first quarter revenue to slightly decline, and noted in its statement the first quarter revenue was in line with its outlook. First quarter revenue in its smart consumer electronics products, including smartphones, declined year-on-year, which it blamed on a high base from last year when it was rushing to fulfil orders after a key factory in China's Zhengzhou re-opened following COVID pandemic-related disruptions. However, for cloud and networking products it said there was significant year-on-year growth in the first three months of the year, ""with strong customers' pull-in for the cloud segment"". Last month, Foxconn adopted a far more bullish outlook for this year, saying on its fourth quarter earnings call that it expected a significant rise in revenue driven by booming demand for artificial intelligence servers. Foxconn's shares have surged 52% so far this year, compared with a 13% jump for the broader market. The company holds its first quarter earnings calls on May 14.

347,AAPL,"These 2 ""Magnificent Seven"" Stocks Are in the Spotlight for All the Wrong Reasons",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-magnificent-seven-stocks-spotlight-080300743.html,"Most of these market giants have continued to soar, led by Nvidia, which has gained 79% so far this year. That helped the S&P 500 rise more than 10% for its best first quarter in five years, and that's kept the Magnificent Seven in the spotlight in 2024. But two members of this elite group no longer are wowing investors, and instead, are in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons. Let's take a closer look. Which stocks am I talking about? Apple, the maker of world-famous products like the iPhone and Mac, and electric vehicle (EV) leader Tesla. These stocks have disappointed investors with their performance over the past few months, falling 11% and 32%, respectively, since the start of the year. In fact, they even weighed negatively on the performance of the S&P 500 in the first quarter, together shaving 1.3 percentage points off the index's return, according to Statista. The chart below shows Apple's -7.1% contribution and Tesla's -5% contribution to the S&P 500's total return for the quarter. These two made the biggest negative contributions to the index. A few reasons may be behind investors' decisions to turn their backs on shares of Apple and Tesla in the first quarter. Let's start with Apple. Yes, the company has grown earnings over time, and its products remain favorites worldwide. For example, Apple, for the first time, took the top seven positions in Counterpoint Research's list of best-selling smartphones in 2023. But some fans still are waiting for the next big innovation from Apple. Though the company recently released its Apple Vision Pro spatial computer earlier this year, it's been met with mixed reviews. Apple also has been slower than other tech giants to detail its plans for AI. So, investors looking to bet on current and future high-growth players may turn away from Apple in favor of a company that offers a solid and clear path to growth over the next few years. Now let's consider Tesla. The company last year made moves such as lowering the prices on certain vehicles to increase volume and cutting production costs, and this is positive. But at the same time, some of Tesla's current efforts are weighing on earnings, and the company also faces headwinds such as competition and negative currency impact. Tesla shares also trade for 57x forward earnings estimates, making them the most expensive of all of the Magnificent Seven stocks by this measure. This clearly could hurt demand for the stock and spur investors to buy shares of cheaper Magnificent Seven players right now. As mentioned above, Nvidia has posted the best performance of all of these companies and contributed the most to the S&P 500's increase so far this year. And for good reason. The tech giant delivered triple-digit gains in revenue and net income in the most recent quarter and just announced the upcoming launch of its much-anticipated Blackwell architecture and most powerful chips yet. Investors also are optimistic about the company due to its dominance in the AI chip market, especially considering forecasts that the AI market may surpass $1 trillion by the end of the decade. Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon -- the other top contributors to the S&P 500's first quarter gain -- also are investing heavily in AI. So, investors in the first few months of the year clearly have been aiming to get in on potential AI winners. Does this mean the party is over for Apple and Tesla (and their shareholders)? Not necessarily. The long-term picture remains bright for both of these market leaders. All of this means that, even though Apple and Tesla are standing in the spotlight today for all the wrong reasons, they -- and their investors -- still could score a major win over the long term.
